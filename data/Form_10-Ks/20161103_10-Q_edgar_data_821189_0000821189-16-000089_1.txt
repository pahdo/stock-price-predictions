  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   (Unaudited) 

1.        Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  General.    The consolidated financial statements of EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), included herein have been prepared by management without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Accordingly, they reflect all normal recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial results for the interim periods presented.  Certain information and notes normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  However, management believes that the disclosures included either on the face of the financial statements or in these notes are sufficient to make the interim information presented not misleading. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in EOG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed on February 25, 2016 (EOG's 2015 Annual Report). 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, EOG adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03, "Interest - Computation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  (ASU 2015-03).  ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset.  In connection with the adoption of ASU 2015-03, EOG restated its December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet to reclassify $  4.8 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs from "Other Assets" to "Long-Term Debt."  Debt issuance costs related to EOG's senior unsecured credit facility remain classified as "Other Assets."  
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards.    In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  (ASU 2016-15).  ASU 2016-15 reduces existing diversity in practice by providing guidance on the classification of eight specific cash receipts and cash payments transactions in the statement of cash flows.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  EOG does not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" (ASU 2016-09), which amends certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment arrangements.  ASU 2016-09 revises or provides alternative accounting for the tax impacts of share-based payment arrangements, forfeitures and minimum statutory tax withholdings and prescribes certain disclosures to be made in the period the new standard is adopted.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early application is permitted.  EOG is evaluating ASU 2016-09 in order to determine what impact the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" (ASU 2016-02), which significantly changes accounting for leases by requiring that lessees recognize a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments, for virtually all lease transactions.  Additional disclosures about an entity's lease transactions will also be required.  ASU 2016-02 defines a lease as "a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration."  ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2018 and early application is permitted.  Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements using a modified retrospective approach.  EOG is reviewing the provisions of ASU 2016-02 to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes" (ASU 2015-17), which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes in a classified balance sheet by eliminating the requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts.  Instead, ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be shown as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.  ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early application is permitted.

    EOG RESOURCES, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)  
  (Unaudited) 

EOG does not intend to early-adopt ASU 2015-17 and does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Accounting for Inventory" (ASU 2015-11), which requires entities to measure most inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value.  ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as "the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal and transportation."  ASU 2015-11 is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early application is permitted.  EOG is reviewing the requirements of the new standard and does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue From Contracts With Customers" (ASU 2014-09), which will require entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 will supersede most current guidance related to revenue recognition when it becomes effective.  The new standard also will require expanded disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and certainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.  The new standard permits adoption through the use of either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11 which rescinds certain SEC guidance in the Accounting Standards Codification, including guidance related to the use of the "entitlements" method of revenue recognition used by EOG.  EOG does not intend to early-adopt ASU 2014-09 and has not determined which transition method it will use.  EOG continues to analyze ASU 2014-09, as well as subsequent guidance which amends and clarifies certain aspects of ASU 2014-09, in order to determine what impact it will have on EOG's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

2.        Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  As more fully discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in EOG's   2015   Annual Report, EOG maintains various stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based compensation expense is included on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income based upon the job function of the employees receiving the grants as follows (in millions): 

The Amended and Restated EOG Resources, Inc. 2008 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (2008 Plan) provides for grants of stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance units and performance stock and other stock-based awards.  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   21.4 million   common shares remained available for grant under the 2008 Plan.  EOG's policy is to issue shares related to the 2008 Plan from previously authorized unissued shares or treasury shares to the extent treasury shares are available. 
    
  Stock Options and Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights and Employee Stock Purchase Plan  .    The fair value of stock option grants and SAR grants is estimated using the Hull-White II binomial option pricing model.  The fair value of Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.  Stock-based compensation expense related to stock option, SAR and ESPP grants totaled   $18.8 million   and   $20.0 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $45.0 million   and   $43.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Weighted average fair values and valuation assumptions used to value stock option, SAR and ESPP grants during the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

Expected volatility is based on an equal weighting of historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options in EOG's common stock.  The risk-free interest rate is based upon United States Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant.  The expected life is based upon historical experience and contractual terms of stock option, SAR and ESPP grants. 
    
  The following table sets forth stock option and SAR transactions for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (stock options and SARs in thousands): 

(1) 
    The total intrinsic value of stock options/SARs exercised for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $58.7 million and $52.4 million, respectively.  The intrinsic value is based upon the difference between the market price of EOG's common stock on the date of exercise and the grant price of the stock options/SARs. 
          
  At   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option, SAR and ESPP grants totaled   $106.1 million  .  Such unrecognized expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of   3.0 years  . 
    
  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.        Employees may be granted restricted (non-vested) stock and/or restricted stock units without cost to them.  Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock units totaled   $13.1 million   and   $16.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $45.5 million   and   $53.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

The following table sets forth restricted stock and restricted stock unit transactions for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (shares and units in thousands): 

(1) 
    The total intrinsic value of restricted stock and restricted stock units released for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was $116.3 million and $102.5 million, respectively.  The intrinsic value is based upon the closing price of EOG's common stock on the date the restricted stock and restricted stock units are released. 
        
  At   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock units totaled   $170.3 million  .  Such unrecognized expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of   2.8 years  . 
    
  Performance Units and Performance Stock.    EOG grants performance units and/or performance stock (Performance Awards) to its executive officers.  As more fully discussed in the grant agreements, the performance metric applicable to these performance-based grants is EOG's total shareholder return over a   three  -year performance period relative to the total shareholder return of a designated group of peer companies (Performance Period).  Upon the application of the performance multiple at the completion of the Performance Period, a minimum of   0%   and a maximum of   200%   of the Performance Awards granted could be outstanding.  Subject to the termination provisions set forth in the grant agreements and the applicable performance multiple, the grants of Performance Awards will "cliff" vest   five   years from the date of grant.  The fair value of the Performance Awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. 
    
  At December 31, 2015,   405,000   Performance Awards were outstanding.  Upon completion of the Performance Period for the Performance Awards granted in 2012, a performance multiple of 200% was applied to the 2012 grants resulting in an additional grant of   142,556   Performance Awards in February 2016.  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, a total of   71,805   Performance Awards were granted.  A total of   134,016   Performance Awards were released during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , with a total intrinsic value of   $9.7 million  , based upon the closing price of EOG's common stock on the release date.  Upon the application of the performance multiple at the completion of the remaining Performance Periods, a minimum of   151,096   and a maximum of   819,594   Performance Awards could be outstanding.  There were   485,345   Performance Awards outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  The total intrinsic value of Performance Awards outstanding at September 30, 2016 was   $46.9 million  . 
    
  Weighted average fair values and valuation assumptions used to value performance unit and performance stock grants of Performance Awards during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:

Expected volatility is based on the term-matched historical volatility over the simulated term, which is calculated as the time between the grant date and the end of the performance period.  The risk-free interest rate is based on a   3.25   year zero-coupon risk-free interest rate derived from the Treasury Constant Maturities yield curve on the grant date. 
    
  Stock-based compensation expense related to the Performance Award grants totaled   $5.7 million   and   $4.1 million   for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $6.6 million   and   $4.8 million   for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , unrecognized compensation expense related to Performance Awards totaled   $7.4 million  .  Such unrecognized expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of   3.3 years  . 

3.        Net Loss Per Share 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of Net Loss Per Share for the   three  -month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except per share data): 

The diluted earnings per share calculation excludes stock options, SARs, restricted stock and units and performance units and stock that were anti-dilutive.  Shares underlying the excluded stock options and SARs totaled   9.9 million   and   9.8 million   shares for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   10.2 million   and   10.0 million   shares for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   For both the   three   months and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   4.6 million   shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units were excluded.  For both the   three   months and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   5.4 million   shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units were excluded.

8.        Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  There are currently various suits and claims pending against EOG that have arisen in the ordinary course of EOG's business, including contract disputes, personal injury and property damage claims and title disputes. While the ultimate outcome and impact on EOG cannot be predicted, management believes that the resolution of these suits and claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on EOG's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. EOG records reserves for contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. 

9.        Pension and Postretirement Benefits 
    
  EOG has defined contribution pension plans in place for most of its employees in the United States, Trinidad and the United Kingdom, and a defined benefit pension plan covering certain of its employees in Trinidad.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , EOG's total costs recognized for these pension plans were   $28 million   and   $27 million  , respectively.  EOG also has postretirement medical and dental plans in place for eligible employees in the United States and Trinidad, the costs of which are not material. 

10.        Long-Term Debt 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , EOG utilized commercial paper borrowings bearing market interest rates, for various corporate financing purposes.  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , EOG had   zero   and   $30 million  , respectively, of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and   no   uncommitted credit facility borrowings.  The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were   $155 million   and   $7 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The weighted average interest rates for commercial paper borrowings during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   0.76%   and   0.45%  , respectively.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   $600 million   aggregate principal amount of EOG's   5.875%   Senior Notes due 2017 were reclassified as long-term debt based upon its intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other long-term debt. 
    
  On   February 1, 2016  , EOG repaid upon maturity the   $400 million   aggregate principal amount of its   2.500%   Senior Notes due 2016 (2016 Notes). 
    
  On   January 14, 2016  , EOG closed its sale of   $750 million   aggregate principal amount of its   4.15%   Senior Notes due 2026 and   $250 million   aggregate principal amount of its   5.10%   Senior Notes due 2036 (collectively, the Notes).  Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year beginning on July 15, 2016.  Net proceeds from the Notes offering totaled approximately   $991 million   and were used to repay the 2016 Notes when they matured on   February 1, 2016  , and for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures.

EOG currently has a   $2.0 billion   senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (Agreement) with domestic and foreign lenders.  The Agreement has a scheduled maturity date of   July 21, 2020  , and includes an option for EOG to extend, on up to two occasions, the term for successive one-year periods subject to certain terms and conditions.  Advances under the Agreement will accrue interest based, at EOG's option, on either the London InterBank Offered Rate plus an applicable margin (Eurodollar rate) or the base rate (as defined in the Agreement) plus an applicable margin.  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the Agreement.  The Eurodollar rate and applicable base rate, had there been any amounts borrowed under the Agreement, would have been   1.53%   and   3.50%  , respectively. 
   
  11.        Fair Value Measurements 
    
  As more fully discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in EOG's   2015   Annual Report, certain of EOG's financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The following table provides fair value measurement information within the fair value hierarchy for certain of EOG's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016  .  There were   no   such amounts outstanding at December 31, 2015.  Amounts shown in millions.

    At September 30, 2016, $2.2 million is included in "Current Assets - Assets From Price Risk Management Activities" and $2.5 million is included in "Other Assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
       
  The estimated fair value of commodity derivative contracts was based upon forward commodity price curves based on quoted market prices.  Commodity derivative contracts were valued by utilizing an independent third-party derivative valuation provider who uses various types of valuation models, as applicable. 
    
  The initial measurement of asset retirement obligations at fair value is calculated using discounted cash flow techniques and based on internal estimates of future retirement costs associated with property, plant and equipment.  Significant Level 3 inputs used in the calculation of asset retirement obligations include plugging costs and reserve lives.  A reconciliation of EOG's asset retirement obligations is presented in Note 6. 
    
  Proved oil and gas properties and other assets with a carrying amount of   $625 million   were written down to their fair value of   $518 million  , resulting in pretax impairment charges of   $107 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Included in the $107 million pretax impairment charges are   $103 million   of impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment for which EOG utilized an accepted offer from a third-party purchaser as the basis for determining fair value.   
    
  Fair Value of Debt.        At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , EOG had outstanding   $6,990 million   and   $6,390 million  , respectively, aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which had estimated fair values of approximately   $7,395 million   and   $6,524 million  , respectively.  The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable (Level 2) inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at the end of each respective period.

12.        Risk Management Activities 
    
  Commodity Price Risk  .    As more fully discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in EOG's   2015   Annual Report, EOG engages in price risk management activities from time to time.  These activities are intended to manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas.  EOG utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments, primarily price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts, as a means to manage this price risk.  EOG has not designated any of its financial commodity derivative contracts as accounting hedges and, accordingly, accounts for financial commodity derivative contracts using the mark-to-market accounting method.  
    
  Commodity Derivative Contracts.    Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil price swap contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl). 

EOG has entered into crude oil collar contracts, which establish ceiling and floor prices for the sale of notional volumes of crude oil as specified in the collar contracts.  The collars require that EOG pay the difference between the ceiling price and the average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil price for the contract month (Index Price) in the event the Index Price is above the ceiling price.  The collars grant EOG the right to receive the difference between the floor price and the Index Price in the event the Index Price is below the floor price.  Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil collar contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with notional volumes expressed in Bbld and prices expressed in $/Bbl. 

Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas price swap contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with notional volumes expressed in million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu). 

EOG has sold call options which establish a ceiling price for the sale of notional volumes of natural gas as specified in the call option contracts.  The call options require that EOG pay the difference between the call option strike price and either the average or last business day NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price for the contract month (Henry Hub Index Price) in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is above the call option strike price.   
  
   -  15  -

In addition, EOG has purchased put options which establish a floor price for the sale of notional volumes of natural gas as specified in the put option contracts.  The put options grant EOG the right to receive the difference between the put option strike price and the Henry Hub Index Price in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is below the put option strike price.  Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas call and put option contracts for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , with notional volumes expressed in MMBtud and prices expressed in $/MMBtu. 

Credit Risk.    Notional contract amounts are used to express the magnitude of a financial derivative.  The amounts potentially subject to credit risk, in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, are equal to the fair value of such contracts (see Note 11).  EOG evaluates its exposure to significant counterparties on an ongoing basis, including those arising from physical and financial transactions.  In some instances, EOG renegotiates payment terms and/or requires collateral, parent guarantees or letters of credit to minimize credit risk. 
    
  All of EOG's derivative instruments are covered by International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreements (ISDAs) with counterparties.  The ISDAs may contain provisions that require EOG, if it is the party in a net liability position, to post collateral when the amount of the net liability exceeds the threshold level specified for EOG's then-current credit ratings.  In addition, the ISDAs may also provide that as a result of certain circumstances, including certain events that cause EOG's credit ratings to become materially weaker than its then-current ratings, the counterparty may require all outstanding derivatives under the ISDAs to be settled immediately.  There were   no   derivative instruments in a net liability position at   September 30, 2016  .  EOG had   no   collateral posted and held   no   collateral at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  

13.  Divestitures 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , EOG received proceeds of approximately   $458 million   primarily from sales of producing properties and acreage in Texas, the Rocky Mountain area and Oklahoma.  Additionally, in the third quarter of 2016, EOG signed purchase and sale agreements for the sale of certain properties in the United States.  At   September 30, 2016  , the book value of these proved oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment held for sale and the related asset retirement obligations were   $55 million   and   $14 million  , respectively.  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , EOG received proceeds of approximately   $144 million   primarily from sales of gathering and processing assets. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, EOG completed the sale of all its Argentina assets.

14.  Subsequent Event 
    
  On   October 4, 2016  , EOG completed its previously announced mergers and related asset purchase transactions with Yates Petroleum Corporation (YPC), Abo Petroleum Corporation (ABO), MYCO Industries, Inc. (MYCO) and certain affiliated entities (collectively with YPC, ABO and MYCO, the Yates Entities). Subject to the terms of the agreements, EOG issued to the shareholders of YPC, ABO and MYCO and to certain of the sellers under the related asset purchase transactions an aggregate of approximately   25 million   shares of EOG common stock and paid to certain of the sellers under the asset purchase transactions an aggregate of approximately   $16 million   in cash for total consideration transferred of   $2.4 billion  . In addition, under the terms of the transactions, EOG repaid approximately   $164 million   of debt owed by the Yates Entities, which was offset by approximately   $64 million   of cash of the Yates Entities. 
    
  The assets of the Yates Entities include producing wells in addition to acreage in the Delaware Basin Core, the Delaware Basin Shelf, the Powder River Basin and other Western basins. The financial results of YPC, ABO and MYCO will be included in EOG's consolidated financial statements beginning October 4, 2016. 
    
  EOG will account for the mergers with YPC, ABO and MYCO and related asset purchase transactions as a business combination under the acquisition method with EOG as the acquirer. Under the acquisition method, the consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with any excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 
    
  Due to the limited time elapsed since the acquisition date, the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete.  As a result, EOG is unable to provide amounts recognized as of October 4, 2016, the acquisition date, for major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from these transactions.  This information will be included in EOG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

PART I.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
    
  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  EOG RESOURCES, INC. 

Overview 
  EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China.  EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries.  This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves.  Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy. 
    
  United States.    EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful.  EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production.  EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.   
    
  Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue.  As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas and the availability of other worldwide energy supplies, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGL, and natural gas prices in the future.  The market prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2016 will continue to impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position and results of operations.  For the first nine months of 2016, the average U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil and natural gas prices were $41.36 per barrel and $2.26 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), respectively, representing declines of 15% each from the average NYMEX prices in 2015.  Based on its 2016 drilling plan, which has been influenced by the continued low commodity price environment, EOG expects 2016 crude oil and condensate and natural gas production to decline slightly as compared to 2015.   
    
  During the first nine months of 2016, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling and completion efficiencies using precision lateral targeting and advanced completion methods and reducing operating and capital costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions.  These efficiency gains along with realized lower service costs resulted in lower drilling and completion costs and decreased operating expenses during the first nine months of 2016.  EOG continues to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins or tactical acquisitions and to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects.  On a volumetric basis, as calculated using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGL production accounted for approximately 72% of United States production during the nine months of 2016 as compared to 71% for the same comparable period of 2015.  During the first nine months of 2016, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Eagle Ford play, Delaware Basin play and Rocky Mountain area.  EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. 
    
  On October 4, 2016, EOG completed its previously announced mergers and related asset purchase transactions with Yates Petroleum Corporation (YPC), Abo Petroleum Corporation (ABO), MYCO Industries, Inc. (MYCO) and certain affiliated entities (collectively with YPC, ABO and MYCO, the Yates Entities). The Yates Entities had recent net production of approximately 28,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 48 percent crude oil. The assets of the Yates Entities include 1.6 million total net acres, with approximately 180,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin Core, approximately 130,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin Shelf and approximately 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin. The financial results of YPC, ABO and MYCO will be included in EOG's consolidated financial statements beginning October 4, 2016.  

-  18  - 

Trinidad.    In Trinidad, EOG continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts.  Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), Modified U(b) Block and the Sercan Area (formerly known as the EMZ area) have been developed and are producing natural gas, which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited.  In the third quarter of 2016, EOG installed a platform and pipeline in the Sercan Area in preparation for its fourth quarter 2016 and 2017 drilling program.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, EOG expects to drill and complete one net well and initiate natural gas sales by year end.  
    
  Other International.    In the United Kingdom, EOG began production from its 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil project in March 2016, selling its first crude oil cargo at the end of the first quarter.  Modifications to the nearby third-party-owned Douglas platform, which is used to process Conwy production, were completed in the first quarter of 2016, and acceptance and performance testing is ongoing.  
    
  In the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China, EOG is evaluating future Shaximiao development opportunities in the Chuan Zhong Block. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, EOG completed the sale of all its Argentina assets. 
    
  EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified. 
    
  Capital Structure  .  One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group.  EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 37% and 34% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.  
    
  On October 4, 2016, in connection with the mergers and related asset purchase transactions with the Yates Entities, EOG issued to the Yates Entities an aggregate of approximately 25 million shares of EOG common stock, subject to the terms of the agreements, and paid to certain of the sellers under the asset purchase transactions an aggregate of approximately $16 million in cash for total consideration transferred of $2.4 billion. In addition, under the terms of the agreements, EOG repaid approximately $164 million of debt owed by the Yates Entities, which was offset by approximately $64 million of cash of the Yates Entities. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, $600 million aggregate principal amount of EOG's 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 were reclassified as long-term debt based upon its intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other long-term debt. 
    
  On February 1, 2016, EOG repaid upon maturity the $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (2016 Notes). 
    
  On January 14, 2016, EOG closed its sale of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.15% Senior Notes due 2026 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.10% Senior Notes due 2036 (collectively, the Notes).  Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2016.  Net proceeds from the Notes offering totaled approximately $991 million and were used to repay the 2016 Notes when they matured on February 1, 2016, and for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures. 
    
  Total anticipated 2016 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion, excluding acquisitions.  The majority of 2016 expenditures will continue to be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities.  EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings.   
    
  When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities.  Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history.

Results of Operations 
    
  The following review of operations for the three months and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. 
    
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs. Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
    Net Operating Revenues.    During the   third   quarter of   2016  , net operating revenues decreased $53 million, or 2%, to $2,119 million from $2,172 million for the same period of   2015  .  Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased $103 million, or 7%, to $1,455 million from $1,558 million for the same period of   2015  .  EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $5 million for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to net gains of $29 million for the same period of   2015  .  Gathering, processing and marketing revenues for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased $40 million, or 7%, to $532 million from $572 million for the same period of   2015  .  Net gains on asset dispositions for the third quarter of 2016 were $108 million, up $109 million, from the net loss of $1 million for the same period of 2015.    

-  20  - 

Wellhead volume and price statistics for the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

(1) 
    Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable. 
              (2) 
    Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China and Canada operations. 
              (3) 
    Dollars per barrel or per thousand cubic feet, as applicable.  Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
              (4) 
    Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas.  MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand. 
              (5) 
    Includes revenue adjustment of $3.62 per Mcf related to a price adjustment for natural gas sales made in China during the period June 2012 through March 2015. 

-  21  - 

Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased $43 million, or 4%, to $1,138 million from $1,181 million for the same period of   2015  .  The decline was primarily due to a lower composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($59 million), partially offset by an increase of 3 MBbld, or 1%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate production ($16 million).  Increased production was primarily due to increases in the Permian Basin and the commencement of production from Conwy, partially offset by declines in the Eagle Ford.  EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased 5% to $43.63 per barrel compared to $45.91 per barrel for the same period of   2015  . 
    
  NGL revenues for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased $17 million, or 18%, to $112 million from $95 million for the same period of   2015   due to a higher composite average price ($13 million) and an increase of 4 MBbld, or 5%, in NGL deliveries ($4 million) primarily in the Permian Basin.  EOG's composite NGL price for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased 13% to $14.92 per barrel compared to $13.24 per barrel for the same period of   2015  . 
    
  Wellhead natural gas revenues for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased $77 million, or 27%, to $205 million from $282 million for the same period of   2015  .  The decrease was due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($48 million) and a decrease in natural gas deliveries ($29 million).  Natural gas deliveries for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased 130 MMcfd, or 10%, compared to the same period of   2015   due primarily to lower production in the United States (98 MMcfd) and Trinidad (26 MMcfd).  The decrease in the United States was due primarily to decreased production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale, Eagle Ford and South Texas areas, partially offset by increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin.  The decrease in Trinidad was primarily due to lower contractual deliveries.  EOG's composite wellhead natural gas price for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased 19% to $1.95 per Mcf compared to $2.40 per Mcf for the same period of   2015  . 
    
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $5 million compared to net gains of $29 million for the same period of   2015  .  During the   third   quarter of   2016  , net cash paid for settlements of financial commodity derivative contracts was $25 million compared to net cash received of $100 million for the same period of   2015  . 
    
  Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand.  Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities.  Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties. 
    
  Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased $23 million as compared to the same prior year period.  The increase primarily reflects higher margins in 2016 on crude oil marketing activities. 
    
  Operating and Other Expenses.      For the   third   quarter of   2016  , operating expenses of $2,312 million were $6,083 million lower than the $8,395 million incurred during the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Third quarter 2015 operating expenses included impairments of proved properties, other property, plant and equipment and other assets of $6,225 million related to commodity price declines.  The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.

The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, DD A and interest expense, net, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015   are set forth below.  See "Net Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of production volumes. 
    
  Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property.  Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses.  Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power.  Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. 
    
  Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations.  EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas.  Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time.  
    
  Lease and well expenses of $226 million for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased $57 million from $283 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased operating and maintenance costs ($46 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses ($14 million). 
    
  DD A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  EOG's DD A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD A group calculations.  There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments.  Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period.  DD A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. 
    
  DD A expenses for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased $178 million to $900 million from $722 million for the same prior year period.  DD A expenses associated with oil and gas properties for the   third   quarter of   2016   were $180 million higher than the same prior year period.  The increase primarily reflects increased rates in the United States ($196 million) and commencement of crude oil production from Conwy in the United Kingdom ($12 million), partially offset by decreased production in the United States ($19 million) and Trinidad ($3 million) and decreased rates in Trinidad ($5 million).  DD A unit rates in the United States increased primarily due to downward revisions of reserves at   December 31, 2015  , as a result of lower commodity prices. 
    
  Exploration costs of $25 million for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased $6 million from $31 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased exploration administrative expenses ($4 million) and decreased geological and geophysical costs ($2 million), all in the United States. 
    
  Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs, as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets.  Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification.  In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. 
    
  Impairments of $178 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 were $6,129 million lower than impairments for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased impairments of proved properties and related assets in the United States ($5,977 million) and lower impairments of proved and unproved properties in Other International ($155 million), partially offset by increased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($5 million).  Third quarter 2015 proved properties and related asset impairments in the United States were primarily related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays.  EOG recorded impairments of proved properties, other property, plant and equipment and other assets of $104 million and $6,225 million for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  

-  23  - 

Interest expense, net, of $71 million for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased $10 million compared to the same prior year period primarily due to interest expense on the Notes issued in January 2016 ($11 million) and decreased capitalized interest ($2 million), partially offset by reduced interest expense as a result of the repayment of the 2016 Notes during February 2016 ($3 million). 
    
  Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes.  Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. 
    
  Taxes other than income for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased $14 million to $92 million (6.3% of wellhead revenues) compared to $106 million (6.8% of wellhead revenues) for the same prior year period.  The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in ad valorem/property taxes ($10 million) and in severance/production taxes ($3 million), primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues, both in the United States. 
    
  Other (expense) income, net for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased $17 million compared to the same prior year period primarily due to increased deferred compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in foreign currency exchange losses. 
    
  EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $82 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $2,199 million in the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss resulting from the absence of certain 2015 impairments. The net effective tax rate of 30% for the third quarter of 2016 was less than the statutory tax rate of 35% due mostly to foreign taxes.  Based on events occurring during the period, EOG accrued interest of $2 million related to unrecognized income tax benefits.  These unrecognized tax benefits, if required to be paid, would result in additional tax credits available for future use.  Accordingly, the impact to the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016, included a $36 million increase to both unrecognized tax benefits and deferred tax assets. 

Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   vs.   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Net Operating Revenues.    During the first   nine   months of   2016  , net operating revenues decreased $1,712 million, or 25%, to $5,249 million from $6,961 million for the same period of   2015  .  Total wellhead revenues for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $1,272 million, or 25%, to $3,777 million from $5,049 million for the same period of   2015  .  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $34 million compared to net gains of $57 million for the same period of   2015  .  Gathering, processing and marketing revenues for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $469 million, or 26%, to $1,352 million from $1,821 million for the same period of   2015  .  Net gains on asset dispositions for the first nine months of 2016 increased $107 million to $102 million from net losses of $5 million for the same period of 2015.    

-  24  - 

Wellhead volume and price statistics for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

(1) 
    Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments. 
              (2) 
    Includes revenue adjustment of $1.19 per Mcf related to a price adjustment for natural gas sales made in China during the period June 2012 through March 2015. 
     
   -  25  - 

Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $943 million, or 24%, to $2,951 million from $3,894 million for the same period of   2015   due primarily to a lower composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($782 million) and a decrease of 13 MBbld, or 4%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate production ($161 million).  Decreased production was primarily due to declines in the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by increased production in the Permian Basin.  EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased 21% to $39.46 per barrel compared to $49.92 per barrel for the same period of   2015  . 
    
  NGL revenues for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $12 million, or 4%, to $299 million from $311 million for the same period of   2015   due primarily to a lower composite average price ($36 million), partially offset by an increase of 6 MBbld, or 7%, in NGL deliveries ($24 million) primarily in the Permian Basin.  EOG's composite NGL price for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased 11% to $13.34 per barrel compared to $14.93 per barrel for the same period of   2015  . 
    
  Wellhead natural gas revenues for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $317 million, or 38%, to $527 million from $844 million for the same period of   2015   primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($264 million) and a decrease of 84 MMcfd, or 7%, in natural gas deliveries ($53 million) primarily due to lower production in the United States.  The decrease in the United States was due primarily to decreased production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and South Texas areas, partially offset by increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin.  EOG's composite wellhead natural gas price for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased 34% to $1.62 per Mcf compared to $2.44 per Mcf for the same period of   2015  . 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $34 million compared to net gains of $57 million for the same period of   2015  .  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , net cash paid from settlements of financial commodity derivative contracts was $22 million compared to net cash received of $661 million for the same period of   2015  . 
    
  Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs for the first   nine   months of   2016   increased $82 million as compared to the same period of   2015  .  The increase primarily reflects higher margins in 2016 on crude oil marketing activities and sand sales, partially offset by lower margins in natural gas marketing activities. 
    
  Operating and Other Expenses.    For the first   nine   months of   2016  , operating expenses of $6,368 million were $6,949 million lower than the $13,317 million incurred during the same period of   2015  .  Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2015 included impairments of proved properties, other property, plant and equipment and other assets of $6,230 million related to commodity price declines.  The following table presents the costs per Boe for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. 
       
  The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD A, G A and interest expense, net, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015   are set forth below.  See "Net Operating Revenues" above for a discussion of production volumes. 
    
  Lease and well expenses of $686 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $248 million from $934 million for the same prior year period primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs ($214 million) and lease and well administrative expenses ($33 million), all in the United States. 

-  26  - 

Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale.  Transportation costs include transportation fees, costs associated with crude-by-rail operations, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs. 
    
  Transportation costs of $571 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $71 million from $642 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($47 million), the Eagle Ford ($18 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($14 million), partially offset by increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($10 million). 
    
  DD A expenses for the first   nine   months of   2016   increased $147 million to $2,691 million from $2,544 million for the same prior year period.  DD A expenses associated with oil and gas properties for the first   nine   months of   2016   were $156 million higher than the same prior year period.  The increase primarily reflects increased rates in the United States ($240 million) and the commencement of crude oil production from Conwy in the United Kingdom ($14 million), partially offset by decreased production in the United States ($96 million).  DD A unit rates in the United States increased primarily due to downward revisions of reserves at   December 31, 2015  , as a result of lower commodity prices. 
    
  Exploration costs of $86 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $29 million from $115 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical costs ($16 million) and decreased administrative expenses ($15 million) in the United States. 
    
  G A expenses of $293 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   increased $35 million from $258 million for the same prior year period primarily due to employee-related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements. 
    
  Interest expense, net, of $210 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   increased $36 million compared to the same prior year period primarily due to a net increase in debt outstanding ($28 million) and decreased capitalized interest ($8 million). 
    
  Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets. 
    
  Gathering and processing costs for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $16 million to $90 million compared to the same prior year period primarily due to decreased operating expenses in the Eagle Ford ($11 million) and Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($6 million), partially offset by costs associated with the commencement of crude oil production from Conwy in the United Kingdom ($4 million) and increased activities in the Permian Basin ($2 million). 
    
  Impairments of $322 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   were $6,123 million lower than impairments for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased impairments of proved properties and related assets in the United States ($5,978 million) and lower impairments of proved and unproved properties in Other International ($155 million), partially offset by increased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($14 million), which was caused by higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in EOG's estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration.  For the first nine months of 2015, proved property and related asset impairments in the United States were related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays.  EOG recorded impairments of proved properties, other property, plant and equipment and other assets of $107 million and $6,230 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Taxes other than income for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $88 million to $246 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) from $334 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) for the same prior year period.  The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severance/production taxes ($58 million) as a result of decreased wellhead revenues and decreased ad valorem/property taxes ($39 million) in the United States, partially offset by a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2016 for Texas high-cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($11 million). 
    
  Other (expense) income, net for the first   nine   months of   2016   increased $41 million compared to the same prior year period primarily due to an increase in foreign currency exchange losses and increased deferred compensation expense. 
    
  EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $409 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $2,283 million for the same period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss resulting from the absence of certain 2015 impairments. The net effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was 30% primarily due to additional Trinidad taxes resulting from a tax settlement reached in the second quarter of 2016 ($43 million).

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
    
    Cash Flow.      The primary sources of cash for EOG during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and proceeds from sales of assets.  The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , EOG's cash balance increased $330 million to $1,049 million from $719 million at   December 31, 2015  .   
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities of $1,554 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased $1,425 million compared to the same period of   2015   primarily due to a decrease in wellhead revenues ($1,272 million) and an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of commodity derivative contracts ($683 million), partially offset by a decrease in cash operating expenses ($420 million) and a favorable change in net cash paid for income taxes ($71 million). 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities of $1,264 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   decreased by $3,282 million compared to the same period of   2015   due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,137 million), favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($640 million), an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($313 million) and a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($192 million). 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities of $28 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   included net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes ($991 million).  Cash used in financing activities for the first   nine   months of   2016   included repayments of the 2016 Notes ($400 million), cash dividend payments ($277 million), net commercial paper repayments ($260 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($56 million).  Net cash provided by financing activities of $231 million for the first   nine   months of 2015 included net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt ($990 million), net commercial paper borrowings ($30 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($24 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($15 million).  Cash used in financing activities for the first   nine   months of 2015 included repayments of long-term debt ($500 million), cash dividend payments ($275 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($43 million). 
    
  Total Expenditures.    For the year   2016  , EOG's budget for exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures is approximately $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion, excluding acquisitions.  The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

-  28  - 

Exploration and development expenditures of $1,867 million for the first   nine   months of   2016   were $2,166 million lower than the same period of   2015   primarily due to decreased exploration and drilling expenditures in the United States ($1,207 million), Trinidad ($79 million) and Other International ($6 million);  decreased facilities expenditures ($408 million); decreased property acquisitions ($362 million); decreased leasehold acquisitions ($63 million); and decreased geological and geophysical expenditures ($16 million).  Exploration and development expenditures for the first   nine   months of   2016   of $1,867 million consisted of $1,686 million in development drilling and facilities, $142 million in exploration, $25 million in capitalized interest and $14 million in property acquisitions.  Exploration and development expenditures for the first   nine   months of   2015   of $4,033 million consisted of $3,339 million in development drilling and facilities, $376 million in property acquisitions, $285 million in exploration and $33 million in capitalized interest. 
    
  The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors.  EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant.  While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. 
    
  Commodity Derivative Transactions.    As more fully discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in EOG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed on February 25, 2016, EOG engages in price risk management activities from time to time.  These activities are intended to manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas.  EOG utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments, primarily price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts, as a means to manage this price risk.  EOG has not designated any of its financial commodity derivative contracts as accounting hedges and, accordingly, accounts for financial commodity derivative contracts using the mark-to-market accounting method.  Under this accounting method, changes in the fair value of outstanding financial instruments are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change and are recorded as Gains (Losses) on Mark-to-Market Commodity Derivative Contracts on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.  The related cash flow impact is reflected in Cash Flows from Operating Activities.  
    
  The total fair value of EOG's commodity derivative contracts was reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2016, as a net asset of $5 million.  Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil price swap contracts through November 3, 2016, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl). 

EOG has entered into crude oil collar contracts, which establish ceiling and floor prices for the sale of notional volumes of crude oil as specified in the collar contracts.  The collars require that EOG pay the difference between the ceiling price and the average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil price for the contract month (Index Price) in the event the Index Price is above the ceiling price.  The collars grant EOG the right to receive the difference between the floor price and the Index Price in the event the Index Price is below the floor price.  Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil collar contracts through November 3, 2016, with notional volumes expressed in Bbld and prices expressed in $/Bbl.

Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas price swap contracts through November 3, 2016, with notional volumes expressed in MMBtu per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu). 

EOG has sold call options which establish a ceiling price for the sale of notional volumes of natural gas as specified in the call option contracts.  The call options require that EOG pay the difference between the call option strike price and either the average or last business day NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price for the contract month (Henry Hub Index Price) in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is above the call option strike price.   
    
  In addition, EOG has purchased put options which establish a floor price for the sale of notional volumes of natural gas as specified in the put option contracts.  The put options grant EOG the right to receive the difference between the put option strike price and the Henry Hub Index Price in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is below the put option strike price.  Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas call and put option contracts through November 3, 2016, with notional volumes expressed in MMBtud and prices expressed in $/MMBtu.

Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements.  EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will," "should" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements.  In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, reduce or otherwise control operating and capital costs, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.  Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct.  Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control.  Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: 

the timing, extent and duration of changes in prices for, supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities;  
                
    the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves;  
                
    the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, and maximize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects;

  (e)      Fractional New Common Stock  .

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Common Shares converted in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of New Common Stock (after taking into account all Common Shares exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest and rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Average Parent Common Stock Price, and (ii) the fraction of a share of New Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this   Article III  . As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.  
    
  (f)      Termination of Exchange Fund  .      Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Common Shares on the 365   th    day following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent if and when demanded by Parent and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Common Shares who have not theretofore complied with this   Article III   shall thereafter look only to the Buyers for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Common Shares, any cash in lieu of a fractional share of New Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to   Section 3.3(e)  , or any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of New Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to   Section 3.3(c)   following compliance with   Section 3.3(b)   or   Section 3.3(h)  , in each case, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Common Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be held by Parent and be subject to applicable escheat, abandoned property or similar laws.  
    
  (g)      No Liability  .      To the fullest extent permitted by Law, none of the Buyers, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Representatives shall be liable to any holder of Common Shares for any of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends with respect to Parent Common Stock) delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.  
    
  (h)      Lost Certificates  .      If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver and pay the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Common Shares represented by such Certificate and any payments to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to   Section 3.3(c)   or   Section 3.3(e)  .  

21

  (c)    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this   Section 7.8   shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,  
  
   50 

proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this   Section 7.8  . 
    
    Section 7.9      Notification of Certain Matters  .

    Section 7.10      Employee Matters  . 
    
  (a)    With respect to each employee who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who remains employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or becomes an employee of Parent or any Parent Affiliate, including the Surviving Corporation (the    Continuing Employees   ), Parent shall: (i) cause all existing employment agreements between the Company (or the applicable Subsidiary thereof) and such Continuing Employees (including at-will agreements that may be terminated with or without notice and with or without liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to be honored or, (ii) in the absence of such existing employment agreements, set or cause the applicable employing entity to set the annual base salaries (or hourly wages, as applicable) for the Continuing Employees at the same levels that existed for the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date;   provided  ,   however  , that such salary for a Continuing Employee may be reduced if mutually agreed to by the Continuing Employee and Parent. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided other employee benefits to the Continuing Employees that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits made available to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date. Nothing in this   Section 7.10(a)   shall be read to constitute a contract of employment or a guarantee of employment or future level of compensation or future employee benefits to any Continuing Employee or shall be deemed to limit the right of Parent or any Parent Affiliate to change, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or arrangement in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date, Continuing Employee shall be eligible for equity grants under the Parent Equity Comp Plan based on the applicable Continuing Employee s position and level of total compensation compared to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.  For a period of 12 months after the Closing Date, Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in any annual cash incentive programs maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries based on the applicable Continuing Employee s position and level of  
  
   51 

total compensation compared to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries;   provided  ,   however  , that, with respect to any annual cash incentive for 2016, Continuing Employees shall only be eligible for a pro-rated amount for the period from the Closing Date through December 31, 2016. 
    
  (b)    Except as set forth below in this   Section 7.10(b)  , immediately following the Closing Date, a Continuing Employee shall become eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the EOG Resources, Inc. Savings and Retirement Plan, (each, a    New Benefit Plan   ) as determined by the Parent, to the extent such Continuing Employee meets the eligibility requirements of such New Benefit Plan. From the Closing Date through December 31, 2016, Continuing Employees shall continue to participate in the group health, dental, vision, disability, or life Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employees participate immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent feasible, Parent intends to terminate the health or welfare Company Benefit Plans effective as of December 31, 2016. After the termination of such Company Benefit Plans, a Continuing Employee shall become eligible to participate in the New Benefit Plans providing health or welfare benefits as determined by the Parent, to the extent such Continuing Employee meets the eligibility requirements of such New Benefit Plan and subject to the last sentence of   Section 7.10(c)  .  
    
  (c)    To the extent that a Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in a New Benefit Plan, Parent shall cause such New Benefit Plan, including the EOG Resources, Inc. Savings and Retirement Plan to recognize the service of such Continuing Employee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and, except with respect to any defined benefit pension plan, contributions under such New Benefit Plan, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time;   provided   that such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee with respect to the same period of service. With respect to any New Benefit Plan that is a health, dental, vision plan or other welfare plan in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing condition limitations, actively-at-work requirements or eligibility waiting periods under such New Benefit Plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employee to the extent such limitation would have been inapplicable, waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. 
    
  (d)    Effective no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall freeze any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code such that no employee shall be eligible to participate in such Company Benefit Plan and no additional contributions shall be made to such Company Benefit Plan for any payroll period that begins on or after the Closing Date. Effective as of the date immediately following the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt the EOG Resources, Inc. Savings and Retirement Plan on behalf of each Continuing Employee who immediately prior to the Effective Time participated in a Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and that contains a feature meeting the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code and for each employee hired by the Company thereafter on the same terms as the employees of the Parent or Parent s Affiliates who participate in the EOG Resources, Inc. Savings and Retirement Plan. No later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Buyer with evidence that any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been frozen as required under this   Section 7.10(d)  . Parent shall cause the EOG Resources, Inc. Savings and Retirement Plan to recognize the service of such Continuing Employee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable  
  
   52 

Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time. 
    
  (e)    Effective no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any Company Benefit Plans maintained by the Company that Buyer has requested to be terminated, including but not limited to any bonus plan or long-term incentive plan, by providing written notice to the Company at least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, and no amounts shall be payable under such terminated Company Benefit Plans at any time after the Effective Time (except for any payment or benefit payable as a result of the consummation of the Merger Transactions as listed on   Annex G   to this Agreement),   provided   that such Company Benefit Plans can be terminated in accordance with their terms and applicable Law without any adverse consequences with respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by the Company or by any of the Company s ERISA Affiliates. No later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Buyer with evidence that such Company Benefit Plans have been or will be, contingent upon the Closing of this Agreement, terminated.  
    
  (f)    Prior to December 31, 2016, the Continuing Employees shall be permitted to use all accrued unused vacation existing before the Effective Time. The Continuing Employees shall also be permitted to roll up to 40 hours  (or more hours if necessary for unavoidable business needs) of accrued unused vacation remaining as of December 31, 2016 into the next calendar year to be used in 2017 in accordance with the then-current vacation policy of Parent.  Effective January 1, 2017, Continuing Employees shall also become eligible to participate in the EOG Resources, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and shall accrue vacation based on the then-current vacation policy of Parent and in accordance with the Continuing Employee s service awarded under   Section 7.10(c)  . 
    
  (g)    Effective January 1, 2017, the Continuing Employees shall become eligible to participate in the EOG Resources, Inc. Retiree Health Plan, and Parent shall cause such Retiree Health Plan to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and contributions under such Retiree Health Plan. 
    
  (h)    The provisions of this   Section 7.10   are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates), other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this   Section 7.10  ) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this   Section 7.10   amends, or shall be deemed to amend (or prevent the amendment or termination of) any Company Benefit Plan or New Benefit Plan. Except to comply with existing employment agreements between the Company (or the applicable Subsidiary thereof) and Continuing Employees, Parent (i) has no obligation to continue to employ or retain the services of any Continuing Employee for any period of time following the Effective Time, and (ii) shall be entitled to modify any compensation or benefits provided to, and any other terms or conditions of employment of, any such employees in its absolute discretion.

  PERFORMANCE UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 
    
  Grantee:      [NAME] [EMPLOYEE ID] 
  Congratulations! You have been granted an Award of EOG Resources, Inc. Performance Units as follows: 
                 Date of Grant: 
    [GRANT DATE] 
      Performance Units granted under  
  this Award (subject to adjustment as set forth below): 
    [# UNITS] 

The Compensation Committee of the Board of EOG Resources, Inc. (the    Company   ) hereby grants to you, the above-named Grantee, effective as of the Date of Grant set forth above, a Performance Unit Award (the  Award ) in accordance with the terms set forth below. 
  General  .  This Performance Unit Award Agreement (this  Agreement ) is governed by the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated EOG Resources, Inc. 2008 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (as may be amended from time to time, the    Plan   ), which is hereby made a part of this Agreement.  All capitalized terms that are not defined in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them under the Plan.    U  nder the terms of this Agreement and the Plan, a Performance Unit ledger account will be maintained by the Company (or its agent) until you become vested in the Performance Units (i.e., the lapse of the forfeiture restrictions thereon) or the Performance Units are forfeited and canceled pursuant to this Agreement.   
  Performance Period; TSR Rank; Performance Multiple  .  Upon the completion of the Performance Period (as defined on Annex A) and the certification (in writing) by the Committee of the Total Shareholder Return (as defined on Annex A) over the Performance Period of the Company and each Peer Company (as defined on Annex A) and the Company s corresponding TSR Rank (see chart on Annex A) for the Performance Period and the applicable Performance Multiple (as specified in the chart on Annex A), such Performance Multiple shall be applied to the number of Performance Units granted hereunder and, except in the case of an applicable Performance Multiple of 100% or an applicable Performance Multiple of 0% (in which case all Performance Units granted hereunder shall be deemed forfeited and canceled), your Performance Unit ledger account shall be adjusted to reflect (i) the additional Performance Units credited to you (in the case of a Performance Multiple greater than 100%) or (ii) your decreased Performance Units (in the case of a Performance Multiple less than 100% but greater than 0%).   
  After the application of the Performance Multiple, your resulting Performance Units shall continue to vest subject to the provisions of this Agreement (except in the case of an applicable Performance Multiple of 0%, in which case all Performance Units granted hereunder shall be deemed forfeited and canceled). 
  Voting Rights; Dividend Equivalents  .  You will have no voting rights with respect to the Company common stock represented by your Performance Units (including any additional Performance Units which may be credited to you upon the completion of the Performance Period based on the applicable Performance Multiple) until such time as the Company common stock is issued to you upon your vesting in the Performance Units.  Dividend equivalents on unvested Performance Units shall accrue and be credited by the Company for your benefit, and any such dividend equivalents accrued and credited for your benefit through the date immediately prior to the date of certification by the Committee of the applicable Performance Multiple shall have the same Performance Multiple applied as is applied to your Performance Units.  However, such dividend equivalents (as so adjusted) shall not be paid to you until you become vested in the related Performance Units and shall be forfeited in the event of the forfeiture and cancellation of the related Performance Units pursuant to this Agreement.   
  Vesting  .  Assuming your continuous employment with the Company or an Affiliate, this Award shall vest on   [five-year anniversary of grant date]  ,     and the shares of Company common stock represented (on a one-for-one basis) by the Performance Units granted hereunder (as adjusted for the applicable Performance Multiple, and on a one-for-one basis) and all dividend equivalents with respect to such Performance Units shall be distributed to you on the first business day following   [five-year anniversary of grant date]   or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but no later than 60 days after such date.

 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE

Exhibit 

Exhibit 95 
    
  Mine Safety Disclosure Exhibit 
    Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the related rules promulgated thereunder by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), each operator of a coal or other mine is required to disclose certain mine safety matters in its periodic reports filed with the SEC.   
  EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) has sand mining operations in Texas and Wisconsin, which support EOG's exploration and development operations.  EOG's sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act).  MSHA inspects mining facilities on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act.   
  EOG was the operator of the following sand mining facilities during the quarter ended September 30, 2016: 
     __________ 
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, EOG did not receive any of the following from MSHA: (i) a citation for a violation of a mandatory health or safety standard that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard under Section 104 of the Mine Act; (ii) an order issued under Section 104(b) of the Mine Act; (iii) a citation or order for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety standards under Section 104(d) of the Mine Act; (iv) written notice of a flagrant violation under Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act; (v) an imminent danger order issued under Section 107(a) of the Mine Act; (vi) any proposed assessments under the Mine Act; (vii) written notice of a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of mine health or safety hazards under Section 104(e) of the Mine Act; or (viii) written notice of the potential to have such a pattern.  Moreover, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, EOG did not experience a mining-related fatality.   
  In addition, as of September 30, 2016, EOG did not have any legal action pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (Mine Commission), and did not have any legal actions instituted or resolved before the Mine Commission during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.
