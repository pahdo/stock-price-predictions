  Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements   
  September 30, 2016  
  (Unaudited)  
   
  Note 1 - Organization, Business and Operations  
   
 On September 27, 2006, Apollo Acquisition Corporation (the  Company ) was formed in the Cayman Islands with the objective to acquire or merge with an operating business. 
   
 On November 15, 2012, the Company, Access America Fund, L.P. (the  Access America ), and Sword Dancer, LLC (the  Sword Dancer ) entered into and closed a Stock Purchase Agreement, whereby the Sword Dancer agreed to purchase from the Access America, 781,250 ordinary shares of the Company s capital stock, par value $0.000128 per share ( Ordinary Shares ), representing approximately 78.3% of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of $33,334. As a result of the transaction, Sword Dancer became our controlling stockholder. 
   
 On March 20, 2013, Sword Dancer sold to Hybrid Kinetic Automotive Holdings, LLC, a Delaware corporation ( Hybrid Kynetic ), in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 781,250 Ordinary Shares of the Company, representing all of the shares of the Company held by Sword Dancer, for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000. As a result, Hybrid Kinetic acquired approximately 78.3% of the Company s common equity. 
   
 On February 13, 2015, Hybrid Kinetic sold 781,250 Ordinary Shares of the Company to American Compass, Inc., a California corporation ( ACI ), in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for an aggregate purchase price of $781,250. As a result of the transaction, ACI was the beneficial owner of approximately 78.3% of the Company s issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares. 
   
 On February 17, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Lianyungang HK New Energy Vehicle System Integration Corporation, a company organized under the laws of the People s Republic of China ( Lianyungang China ), pursuant to which the Company issued 20,000,000 Ordinary Shares of the Company to Lianyungang China at a price of $1.00 per share, for aggregate proceeds equal to $20,000,000. As a result of the transaction, Lianyungang China beneficially owned approximately 95.24% of the Company s issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares.  
   
 On March 18, 2015 (the  TL Effective Date ), the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement (the  TL Agreement ) with Ford Cheer International Limited, a company organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong ( Ford Cheer ). Under the terms of the Agreement, Ford Cheer granted to the Company an irrevocable, exclusive right and license, including the right to sublicense, certain inventions, technology, know-how, patents and other intellectual property rights regarding the production of materials for use in lithium batteries (the  Licensed Technology ). As consideration for the Licensed Technology, the Company paid to Ford Cheer a one-time fee of $20,000,000. The TL Agreement commenced on the Effective Date and will continue for a term of twenty (20) years. 
   
 On March 23, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) with HK Battery Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  HK Battery ), to purchase 10,000,000 shares of HK Battery s common stock, par value of $0.001 per share, at a per share price of $1.00. On June 26, 2015, the parties terminated the SPA. 
   
 Effective May 29, 2015, Chuantao Wang, Jianguo Xu, Tim Xia, Junwen Hou, Sijun He, Xiaodong Yan and Vincent Wang all resigned as Directors; Jianguo Xu resigned as Chief Executive Officer; and Chunhua Huang resigned as Chief Financial Officer. 
   
 Effective May 29, 2015, Jiafu Wei and Cliff Guan were appointed as Directors of the Company; Jiafu Wei was appointed Chief Executive Officer; Cliff Guan was appointed Chief Financial Officer; Chunhua Huang was appointed Chief Intelligence Officer; and Shuning Luo was appointed Secretary. 
   
 On June 22, 2015, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Apollo Technology Corporation, a Cayman Islands Exempted Company ( Apollo Subsidiary ) and transferred the $20,000,000, representing other intangible assets, to Apollo Subsidiary.  On June 26, 2015, the Company entered into a Common Stock Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with Lianyungang Corporation, a Cayman Islands Exempted Company ( Lianyungang ).  Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company transferred, conveyed and assigned 100% of its equity interest in Apollo Subsidiary to Lianyungang (the  Apollo Subsidiary Transfer ).  In exchange for the Apollo Subsidiary Transfer, Lianyungang transferred, conveyed and assigned its 95.26% equity interest in the Company to the Company for cancellation. Upon the closing of the transaction, ACI beneficially owned 78.3% of the Company s issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares.

Effective as of September 2, 2015, Jiafu Wei resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Director the Company and Jianguo Xu was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company.   
   
 Effective as of October 31, 2015, Cliff Guan resigned as Chief Financial Officer of the Company and Jianguo Xu was appointed Chief Financial Officer of the Company. 
   
 On November 6, 2015, ACI entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hybrid Kinetic, pursuant to which ACI sold to Hybrid Kynetic 781,250 Ordinary Shares of the Company at a purchase price of $1.00 per share (the  Stock Purchase ).  The Stock Purchase was a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Upon the closing of the Stock Purchase, the Hybrid Kynetic was the beneficial owner of approximately 78.3% of the Company s issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares. Hybrid Kynetic has not advised the Company of any plans to appoint new directors to the Company s Board of Directors or to make any changes to the Company s management or operations. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not yet commenced operations. All activity from September 27, 2006, the Company s date of inception, through September 30, 2016 relates to the Company s formation. The Company selected June 30 as its fiscal year-end. 
   
 The Company, based on its proposed business activities, is a  blank check  company. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines such a company as  a development stage company  as it either has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person; and has issued  penny stock , as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of  blank check  companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in its securities, either debt or equity, until the Company concludes a business combination with an operating entity. 
   
 The Company was organized to acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly-held company and, to a lesser extent that desires to employ the Company s funds in its business. The Company s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a business combination rather than short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the Company. 
   
  Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 These condensed financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 27, 2016. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
  Loss per Ordinary Share  
   
 Basic loss per ordinary share is based on the weighted effect of ordinary shares issued and outstanding, and is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per ordinary share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the basic loss per share calculation plus the number of ordinary shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares outstanding. The Company does not present diluted earnings per share for years in which it incurred net losses as the effect is antidilutive. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, there were no potentially dilutive ordinary shares outstanding.

Income Taxes  
   
 Apollo Acquisition Corporation was registered as an Exempted Company in the Cayman Islands, and therefore, is not subject to Cayman Islands income taxes for 20 years from the Date of Inception. While the Company has no intention of conducting any business activities in the United States, the Company would be subject to United States income taxes based on such activities that would occur in the United States. 
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company attaining future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 Our financial instruments consist of accounts payable and accrued expenses. We believe the fair value of our payables reflects their carrying amounts. 
   
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC (Accounting Standards Codification) 820-10 (SFAS No. 157),  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  for financial assets and liabilities. FASB ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value: 
   
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
   
 Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities. 
   
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no other intangible assets which would require measurement on a recurring basis based on this guidance. 
   
  Cash  
   
 Cash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company's cash is held with local and national banking institutions and subjected to current FDIC insurance limits of $250,000 per banking institution. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company bank balances in these bank accounts did not exceed the insured amount. The Company has not experienced any losses related to this concentration of risk .  There are no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016. 
   
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10,  Development Stage Entities (Topic 915), Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation . The amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholder s equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The Company s early adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

Note 3   Going Concern  
   
 Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. 
   
 The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the development of its planned business. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a public or private offering of equity or debt securities, or by other means. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty. 
   
 There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from the operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have   a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company s existing stockholders. 
   
 The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. 
   
 All liabilities listed in the condensed financial statements are non-current liabilities. 
   
  Note 4   Related Party Transactions  
   
 During the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, ACI paid $0 and $7,956, respectively, in legal fees on behalf of the Company.

  This report contains forward-looking statements.

We can give no assurances that the assumptions upon which the forward-looking statements are based will prove to be correct. Because forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties including those related to changes in economic conditions, new business opportunities and general financial and business conditions, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  
   
 Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We believe the information contained in this Form 10-Q to be accurate as of the date hereof. Changes may occur after that date. We will not update that information except as required by law in the normal course of its public disclosure practices. 
   
 Additionally, the following discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the audited financial statements and accompanying notes included our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, filed with the SEC. 
   
 Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms  the Company,   we,   us  and  our  refer to Apollo Acquisition Corporation 
   
  OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  
   
 We are a development stage company formed solely for the purpose of identifying and entering into a business combination with a privately held business or company, domiciled and operating in an emerging market that is seeking the advantages of being a publicly held corporation whose stock is eventually traded on a major United States stock exchange. We intend to focus on targets located primarily in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe, as we believe that businesses with operating history and growth potential in these locations would benefit significantly from access to the United States capital markets and may offer the potential of capital appreciation stemming from the economic growth in such emerging markets. 
   
  Plan of Operation  
   
 We have not engaged in any business activities that generate revenue. Our activities to date have been primarily focused upon our formation and raising capital. We have conducted private offerings of our ordinary shares, the proceeds of which we intend to use for payment of costs associated with formation, accounting and auditing fees, legal fees, and costs associated with identifying acquisition targets and completing necessary due diligence. In addition, we expect to incur costs related to filing periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe we will be able to meet these costs for at least the next 12 months by obtaining loans from our shareholders, management or other investors. 
   
 We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering. 
   
  Change of Control  
   
 On February 13, 2015, Hybrid Kinetic sold 781,250 ordinary shares, par value of $0.000128 per share (the  Purchased Shares ) of the Company to American Compass, Inc., a California corporation ( ACI ), in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for an aggregate purchase price of $781,250. As a result of such transaction, ACI was the beneficial owner of approximately 78.3% of the Company's issued and outstanding ordinary shares.

On February 17, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Lianyungang 11K New Energy Vehicle System Integration Corporation, a company organized under the laws of the People's Republic of China (the  Investor ), for gross proceeds equal to an aggregate of $20,000,000 in exchange for the issuance of 20,000,000 ordinary shares of the Company, par value of $0.000128 per share (the  Shares ), at a per share price of $1.00.  On March 17, 2015, the Company received gross proceeds of $20,000,000 from the Investor and the Company issued the Shares to the Investor. The Shares constitute  restricted securities  within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise disposed of by the Purchaser without restriction under the Securities Act and state securities laws. 
   
 On June 22, 2015, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Apollo Technology Corporation, and transferred the $20,000,000 other intangible assets under this subsidiary.  On June 26, 2015, the Company entered into a Common Stock Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with Lianyungang Corporation, a Cayman Islands Exempted Company ( Lianyungang ).  Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company transferred, conveyed and assigned one hundred percent of its equity interest in Apollo Technology Corporation, a Cayman Islands Exempted Company, to Lianyungang (the  Apollo Technology Transfer ).  In exchange for the Apollo Technology Transfer, Lianyungang transferred, conveyed and assigned its ninety-five and twenty-six one-hundredths percent (95.26%) equity interest in the Company to the Company for cancellation.  Upon closing of the transaction, which took place on June 26, 2015 (the  Exchange Closing Date ), the Company redeemed its ordinary shares, which represented 95.26% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares just prior to the Exchange Closing Date.  As a result, American Compass Inc. owned 78.3% of the Company s issued and outstanding ordinary shares.  
   
 On March 23, 2015 (the  SPA Effective Date ), the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) with HK Battery Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Seller ), to purchase Ten Million shares of the Seller's common stock, par value of $0.001 per share (the  Shares ), at a per share price of $1.00. On June 26, 2015, the parties terminated the SPA. 
   
 On November 6, 2015, American Compass, Inc., a California corporation, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hybrid Kinetic Automotive Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the  Buyer ), to sell to the Buyer 781,250 ordinary shares of stock of the Company at a purchase price of $1.00 per share (the  Stock Purchase ).  The Stock Purchase is a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Upon the closing of the Stock Purchase, the Buyer will be the beneficial owner of approximately 78.3% of the Company s issued and outstanding ordinary shares.   
   
 The Buyer has not advised the Company of any plans to appoint new directors to the Company s Board of Directors or to make any changes to the Company s management or operations. 
   
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  
   
 We are still in our development stage and have generated no revenues to date. 
   
 We incurred general and administrative expenses of $12,634 and $7,956 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These expenses consisted of legal and other professional fees and operating costs incurred in connection with the day to day operation of our business and the preparation and filing of our periodic reports. 
   
 Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $12,915 and $8,069, respectively. The increase in net loss is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expenses. 
   
 We have generated no revenues and our net operating loss from inception through September 30, 2016 was $12,915.
