  NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  AS
OF AND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016  

1.  
      DESCRIPTION
    OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2016 and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficiency and
cash flows for the periods presented have been prepared by Nutriband, Inc. and Subsidiary (the  Company  or  Nutriband )
and are unaudited. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements for unaudited interim
periods, and consequently, do not include all disclosures required to be made in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, changes in stockholders' deficiency and
cash flows for all periods presented have been made. The information for the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2016
was derived from audited financial statements of the Company.  

Organization    

Nutriband
Inc. (the  Company  or  Nutriband ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada in January 2016. In January
2016, the Company acquired Nutriband Ltd. ( Nutriband Ltd ), a company registered in Dublin, Ireland, to enter the
health supplement market with new applications of transdermal patches for delivery of supplements. Nutriband Ltd. moved manufacturing
and operations to the United States during 2016. The product line consists of three products: an Energy Patchline, Weight Management
Patchline, and a Multivitamin Patchline.  

Going
Concern    

The
consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended July 31, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates
the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  The Company
has a past history of recurring losses from operations.  The Company will require additional funding to execute its
future strategic business plan.  Successful business operations and its transition to attaining profitability are dependent
upon obtaining additional financing and achieving a level of revenue to support its cost structure.  These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  

Management
acquired Nutriband Ltd. in 2016 to enter the health supplement market. The Company is also exploring some acquisition opportunities
which would expand the Company s operations into the pharmaceutical field, although no agreements have been consummated
at this time.  

Management
believes these acquisitions will be profitable and the cash flows from these operations will enable the Company to fund the operations
of the consolidated group over the next twelve months. Therefore, the annual financial statements continue to be prepared on a
going concern basis.  

Significant
Accounting Policies   

The
Company s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10 for the
period January 4, 2016 (Date of Formation) through January 31, 2016. There were no significant changes to these accounting policies
during the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and the Company does not expect that the adoption of other recent accounting pronouncements
will have a material effect on its financial statements.  

2.    ACQUISITION
                                         OF BUSINESS    

On
January 16, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of Nutriband Ltd., an entity under common control, in exchange for 2,500,000 shares
of the Company s common stock, valued at $13,094, the net liability historical value.  

Details
of the acquisition are as follows:  

3.    INVENTORIES    

Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost and realizable value determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realizable value
is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. The cost of finished
goods and work in progress is comprised of material costs, direct labor costs and other direct costs and related production overheads
(based on normal operating capacity).  

Short-term
debt-related parties as of October 31, 2016, consists of loans from officers and related parties, that are interest free and due
on demand. As of October 31, 2016, short-term debt amounted to $26,620.  

Long-term
debt as of October 31, 2016, consists of a loan from South County Dublin Council that is interest free with monthly payments of
$75. The loan is due October 2017. As of October 31, 2016, the current balance of long-term debt amounted to $1,153.  

5.  
      STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIENCY)   

On
May 12, 2016, a majority of shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation. Each share of
the Company s issued and outstanding common stock shall be subject to a 5-for-1 forward stock split. All shares and per
share amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the forward stock split.  

In
February 2016, the Company issued Nociota Holdings Limited 500,000 shares of common stock in exchange for proceeds of $100,000.
In connection with the transaction, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of common of the Company at an exercise
price of $0.70 per share not sooner than one year from the execution of the transaction and not later than three years from the
closing of the transaction.  

At
a Board meeting held on January 15, 2016, the Company s Board approved the issuance of 19,375,000 shares to be issued to
founders, valued at $19,375.  

At
a Board meeting held January 15, 2016, the Company s Board approved the form of a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company
and Gareth Sheridan, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Company, the purchase of all the outstanding shares and ownership
interests of Nutriband Ltd. in exchange for the issuance to Gareth Sheridan of 2,500,000 shares of the Company s common
stock, valued at $13,094, the net liability historical value.  

6.    RELATED
                                         PARTY TRANSACTIONS    

a)    As
                                         of October 31, 2016, Ann Sheridan, mother of the Chief Executive Officer and a Director
                                         of Nutriband Limited (Irelend), advanced the Company $9,470 for operating capital. The
                                         advance is interest free and due on demand.    

b)    On
                                         January 15, 2016 the Company approved a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company
                                         and Gareth Sheridan for the purchase of all the outstanding shares of Nutriband Ltd.
                                         in exchange for the issuance to Gareth Sheridan of 2,500,000 shares of the Company s
                                         common stock valued at $13,094.    

c)    During
                                         the nine months ended October 31, 2016, the Company s Chief Financial Officer advanced
                                         the Company $17,150 for operating capital. The advance is interest free and due on demand.    

7.    EARNINGS
                                         PER SHARE    

Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period.  Diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average
number of common shares and potential common shares outstanding during the period. As of October 31, 2016, there were 500,000
potential common shares outstanding, that are not included in the dilutive shares outstanding balance because their effect would
be antidilutive.  

The
following table summarizes the changes in warrants outstanding and the related price of the shares of the Company s common
stock issued to non-employees of the Company. The warrants were granted in connection with the proceeds of the sale of common
stock with Nocioto Holdings Limited in February, 2016. The fair value of the warrants issued amounted to $77,315.  

9.    SUBSEQUENT
                                         EVENTS    

On
November 11, 2016, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Nociata Holdings Limited to purchase 150,000 units
of the Company for the purchase price of $0.50 per unit. Each unit shall consist of (1) common share of the Company and (2) one
warrant to acquire one additional common share of the Company at an exercise price of $3.50 per share. The warrant is exercisable
not sooner than one year from execution hereof and not later than the close of business for a period expiring three years from
the closing of any prospectus offering of the sale of additional common shares of the Company.  

ITEM 2.   
       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this report.  

Certain
statements contained in this report, including, without limitation, statements containing the words  believes,   anticipates, 
 expects  and words of similar import, constitute  forward looking statements  within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Our
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors,
including our ability to create, sustain, manage or forecast our growth; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; changes
in our business strategy or development plans; competition; business disruptions; adverse publicity; and international, national
and local general economic and market conditions.  

GENERAL   

Overview    

The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 4, 2016. We plan to enter the health supplement market with new applications
of transdermal patches for delivery of supplements.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

NINE
MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016   

Revenues   

Our
revenue was $0 and we incurred a net loss of $117,683 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

For
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, our selling, general and administrative expenses were $117,683.  

THREE
MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016   

Revenues   

Our
revenue was $0 and we incurred a net loss of $29,980 for the three months ended October 31, 2016, consisting primarily of professional
fees.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

For
the three months ended October 31, 2016, our selling, general and administrative expenses were $29,980.   

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS   

Overview   

As
of October 31, 2016, the Company had $857 in cash. We do not have sufficient resources to effectuate our business. We expect to
incur a minimum of $85,000 in expenses during the next twelve months of operations. We estimate that these expenses will be comprised
primarily of general expenses including marketing and research and development costs, overhead, legal and accounting fees.   

We
will have to raise funds to pay for our expenses. We may have to borrow money from shareholders or issue debt or equity or enter
into a strategic arrangement with a third party. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. We
currently have no arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other
sources. Since we have no such arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability to raise funds for our operations will
have a severe negative impact on our ability to remain a viable company.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company has not generated any revenues, has recurring net losses, a working capital deficiency as of January 31, 2016 of $10,784,
and working capital deficiency of $29,230 as of October 31, 2016, and used cash in operations of $115,839 in the nine month period
ended October 31, 2016. In addition, as of January 31, 2016 and October 31, 2016, the Company had accumulated deficits of $26,204
and $143,887, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern.  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation
of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on the execution of management s plans, which include
the raising of capital through the debt and/or equity markets, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient
to fund working capital requirements. If the Company were not to continue as a going concern, it would likely not be able to realize
its assets at values comparable to the carrying value or the fair value estimates reflected in the balances set out in the preparation
of the consolidated financial statements.  

There
can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in generating additional cash from the equity/debt markets or other sources
to be used for operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary. Based on the Company s current resources,
the Company will not be able to continue to operate without additional immediate funding. Should the Company not be successful
in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, the Company would need to curtail certain or all operational activities
and/or contemplate the sale of its assets, if necessary.  

Estimated
2017 Capital Requirements   

We
estimate our capital requirements over the next twelve months for the development and marketing of our products to be $85,000
to $150,000.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect
on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
discussion and analysis of our plan of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of our consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount
of reported assets and liabilities.  

Some
accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially
different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. Actual results
may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  

It
is the opinion of the Company that inflation has not had a material effect on its operations.  

New
Financial Accounting Standards   

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material
effect on the consolidated financial statements included herewith.
