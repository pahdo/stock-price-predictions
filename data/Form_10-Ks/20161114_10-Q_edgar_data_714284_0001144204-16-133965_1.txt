    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  September 30, 2016  

  (Unaudited)  

NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

SORL Auto Parts, Inc. (together with its
subsidiaries,  we,   us,   our  or the  Company  or  SORL ), a Delaware
corporation incorporated on March 24, 1982, is principally engaged in the manufacture and distribution of vehicle brake systems
and other key safety-related components, through its 90% ownership of Ruili Group Ruian Auto Parts Co., Ltd. (the  Joint
Venture  or  Ruian ). The Company distributes products both in China and internationally under SORL trademarks.
The Company s product range includes 65 categories and over 2000 different specifications. 

The Joint Venture was formed in the People s
Republic of China ( PRC  or  China ) as a Sino-Foreign joint venture on January 17, 2004, pursuant to the
terms of a Joint Venture Agreement between the Ruili Group Co., Ltd. (the  Ruili Group ), a related party under common
control, and Fairford Holdings Limited ( Fairford ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Ruili Group was
incorporated in China in 1987 and specializes in the development, production and sale of various kinds of automotive parts. Fairford
and the Ruili Group contributed 90% and 10%, respectively, of the paid-in capital of the Joint Venture. 

On November 11, 2009, the
Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Fairford, entered into a joint venture agreement with MGR Hong Kong Limited ( MGR ),
a Hong Kong-based global auto parts distribution specialist firm and an unaffiliated Taiwanese investor. The joint venture
was named SORL International Holding, Ltd. ( SIH ) based in Hong Kong. SORL held a 60% interest in the joint venture,
MGR held a 30% interest, and the Taiwanese investor held a 10% interest. SIH was primarily devoted to expanding SORL's international
sales network in Asia-Pacific and creating a larger footprint in Europe, the Middle East and Africa with a target to create a truly
global distribution network. In December 2015, due to poor financial performance of SIH, Fairfold sold all of its interest
in SIH to the Taiwanese investor. After this transaction, SIH ceased to be a distributor of SORL in the international market. 

On May 5, 2016, the Company entered into
a Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with the Ruili Group through Ruian, a related party under common control,
pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase the land use rights and factory facilities located at No. 2666 Kaifaqu Avenue,
Rui an Economic Development Zone, Rui an City, Zhejiang Province, the People s Republic of China (the  Development
Zone Facility ). In exchange for the Development Zone Facility, the Company agree to transfer to the Ruili Group the land
use rights and factory facilities of the Dongshan Facility that Ruian currently owns, plus RMB501,000,000 (approximately $76,533,000)
in cash. The total floor areas of the Dongshan Facility and the Development Zone Facility are 58,714 square meters and 157,619
square meters, respectively. 

The cash consideration in the amount of
RMB481,000,000 (approximately $73,478,000) was paid to the Ruili Group in installments before June 30, 2016, and the remaining
RMB20,000,000 (approximately $3,016,000) will be paid within 10 days of completion of the required procedures for transferring
the title of the facilities and the land use right as specified in the Purchase Agreement. Before the transaction, the Company
was leasing 89,229 square meters of the Development Zone Facility from Ruili Group for its brake systems business, which lease
was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2017. This lease was terminated upon the completion of the purchase. The transaction was
approved by a committee of independent directors of the Company based on the valuation reports of a real estate appraisal firm.

NOTE B - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

(1)      BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in the consolidation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in conjunction
with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted as permitted by the rules and regulations of the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), although the Company believes that the disclosures contained in
this report are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The consolidated balance sheet information as of December
31, 2015 was derived from the consolidated audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated
audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, and other reports filed with the SEC. 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature which are, in the opinion of management, necessary
to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods presented.
The results of operations for these periods are not necessarily comparable to, or indicative of, results of any other interim period
or for the fiscal year taken as a whole. 

(2)      SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   

a. ACCOUNTING
METHOD  

The Company uses the accrual
method of accounting for financial statement and tax return purposes. 

b. USE
OF ESTIMATES  

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes its best estimate
of the outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared.
Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period
when new information becomes available to management. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

6   

c. FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

For certain of the Company s financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, trade receivables and payables, prepaid expenses, deposits
and other current assets, short-term bank borrowings, and other payables and accruals, the carrying amounts approximate fair values
due to their short maturities. 

Transactions involving related parties cannot
be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free market dealings may not
exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were
consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.
It is not, however, practical to determine the fair value of amounts due from/to related parties due to their related party nature. 

d. SHORT
TERM INVESTMENTS   

The Company s short
term investments include term deposits with an original maturity from three months to one year with financial institutions. Term
deposit in the amount of $3,317,650 (RMB 22,000,000) was pledged for the credit line granted to Ruili Group, a related party, by
Bank of Ningbo for the period from January 13, 2016 to July 13, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the term deposit matured and the
pledge was released as the credit line was fully paid off by Ruili Group. 

Term deposits in the amount
of $21,667,802 (RMB 140,000,000) were pledged for the credit line granted to Ruili Group, a related party, by Bank of Ningbo for
the period from March 24, 2015 to March 24, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the term deposits matured and the pledge was released
as the credit line was fully paid off by Ruili Group. 

Term deposit in the amount
of $6,190,800 (RMB 40,000,000) was pledged as security interest for the bank acceptance notes payable issued to Hangzhou Xiangwei
Wuzi Co., Ltd, a related party controlled by the relative of Ms. Shu Ping Chi, by Zhejiang Chouzhou Commercial Bank for the period
from December 17, 2015 to June 17, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the term deposit matured and the pledge was released as the
bank acceptance notes payable were paid off by Hangzhou Xiangwei Wuzi Co., Ltd. 

e. RESTRICTED
CASH  

Restricted cash mainly
represents bank deposits used to pledge the bank acceptance notes. The Company entered into credit agreements with commercial banks
in China ( endorsing banks ) which agree to provide credit within stipulated limits. Within the stipulated credit limits,
the Company can issue bank acceptance notes to its suppliers as payments for the purchases. In order to issue bank acceptance notes,
the Company is generally required to make initial deposits or pledge note receivables to the endorsing banks in amounts of certain
percentage of the face amount of the bank acceptance notes to be issued by the Company. The cash in such accounts is restricted
for use over the terms of the bank acceptance notes, which are normally three to six months.   

7   

f. RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

A related party is generally
defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more of the Company s securities and their immediate families, (ii) the Company s
management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company, or
(iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction is considered to
be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. The Company conducts
business with its related parties in the ordinary course of business. 

g. NOTES
RECEIVABLE  

Notes receivable generally
due within one year are issued by some customers to pay certain outstanding receivable balances to the Company with specific payment
terms and definitive due dates. Notes receivable do not bear interest. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, notes receivables
in the amount of $31,288,866 and $13,647,583, respectively, were pledged to endorsing banks to issue bank acceptance notes. The
banks charge discount fees if the Company chooses to discount the notes receivables for cash before the maturity of the notes and
such discount fees are included in interest expenses. 

h. REVENUE
RECOGNITION  

Revenue from the sale of
goods is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have transferred to the buyer. The transfer is decided
by several factors, including factors such as when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exits, delivery has occurred, the sales
price is fixed and determinable, and collection is probable. Revenue consists of the invoice value for the sale of goods and services
net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts and returns. The Company nets sales return in gross revenue, i.e., the revenue shown
in the income statement is the net sales. 

i. COST OF SALES  

Cost of sales consists
primarily of materials costs, applicable local government levies, freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs,
employee compensation, depreciation and related costs, which are directly attributable to production. Write-down of inventories
to lower of cost or market is also recorded in cost of sales, if any. 

j. FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSLATION  

The Company maintains its books and accounting
records in RMB, the currency of the PRC. The Company s functional currency is also RMB. The Company has adopted FASB ASC
830-30 in translating financial statement amounts from RMB to the Company s reporting currency, United States dollars ( US$ ).
All assets and liabilities are translated at the current rate. The shareholders  equity accounts are translated at the appropriate
historical rate. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average rates in effect on the transaction dates. 

8   

Translation adjustments
resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders  equity.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred.  During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had $43,418 and $320,019 transaction gain, respectively, which
was included in other income. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had $1,268,968 and $1,346,440
transaction gain, respectively, which was included in other income.  

k. RECLASSIFICATIONS  

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net earnings and financial position. 

NOTE C  
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
Revenue Gross versus Net) . The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding
additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these amendments
is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . Public
entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016- 10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing .
The amendments add further guidance on identifying performance obligations and also to improve the operability and understandability
of the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Public
entities should apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting
periods therein. Early application for public entities is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating
the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-11,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance
Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting .
The amendments rescinds SEC paragraphs pursuant to two SEC Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) meeting. Specifically, registrants should not rely on the following SEC Staff Observer comments upon adoption of Topic 606:
(1) Revenue and Expense Recognition for Freight Services in Process, which is codified in paragraph 605-20-S99-2; (2) Accounting
for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, which is codified in paragraph 605-45-S99-1; (3) Accounting for Consideration Given by
a Vendor to a Customer (including Reseller of the Vendor s Products), which is codified in paragraph 605-50-S99-1; and (4)
Accounting for Gas-Balancing Arrangements (i.e., use of the  entitlements method ), which is codified in paragraph
932-10-S99-5. The amendment is effective upon adoption of ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the
impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

9   

In May 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients . The amendments, among other things: (1) clarify the objective of the collectibility criterion for applying paragraph
606-10-25-7; (2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the
transaction price; (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception; (4) provide a practical
expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest
period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and
allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify that a completed contract
for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before
the date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each
prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. These amendments
are effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods
therein (i.e., January 1, 2018, for a calendar year entity). The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of
the adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . These amendments
provide cash flow statement classification guidance for: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon
Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest
Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; (4) Proceeds from the Settlement
of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned Life Insurance
Policies; (6) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; (7) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and
(8) Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. These amendments are effective for public
business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application
is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In September 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-17,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control .
These amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by
changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the
entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. If a reporting entity satisfies the
first characteristic of a primary beneficiary (such that it is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity), the amendments
require that reporting entity, in determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic of a primary beneficiary, to include
all of its direct variable interests in a variable interest entity and, on a proportionate basis, its indirect variable interests
in a variable interest entity held through related parties, including related parties that are under common control with the reporting
entity. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an
entity adopts the pending content that links to this paragraph in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of
the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact
of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

13   

On September 28, 2007,
the Company purchased the Dongshan Facility from Ruili Group for an aggregate purchase price of approximately RMB152 million (approximately
$20 million). A third party real estate appraisal firm appraised the total asset value at RMB154 million (approximately $20.4 million).
RMB69.4 million (approximately $9.1 million) of the purchase price was paid on a transfer of the Company's existing project and
prepayment of land use rights. The remaining balance was paid by the cash and a bank credit line. At the time of the transfer described
below, the Company did not obtain the land use right certificate nor the property ownership certificate of the building. 

On May 5, 2016, the Company
entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Ruili Group through Ruian, pursuant to which the Company agreed to exchange the Dongshan
Facility plus RMB501 million (approximately $76.5 million) in cash for Development Zone Facility. The transaction was approved
by a committee of independent directors of the Company based on the valuation reports issued on March 1, 2016 by a real estate
appraisal firm. The value of the Dongshan Facility and Development Zone Facility was appraised to be RMB 125 million (approximately
$19.1 million) and RMB 626 million (approximately $95.6 million), respectively. The Company reserved the relevant tax amount of
RMB 15.03 million (approximately $2.3 million). This amount was determined based on a 3% tax rate on the consideration paid in
the transaction, which the Company considered as the most probable amount of tax liability. As of September 30, 2016, total amount
of RMB481 million (approximately $73.5 million) was paid to the Ruili Group in installments, and the remaining RMB20 million (approximately

right certificate nor the property ownership certificate of the buildings of the Development Zone Facility.

was entered into between entities under common control, the transaction was recorded at historical costs. The excess of total
cash consideration over the difference between the carrying value of assets received and assets transferred to Ruili Group, a
related party controlled by Mr. Xiao Ping Zhang, his wife Ms. Shu Ping Chi, and his brother Mr. Xiao Feng Zhang, was reflected
as a reduction of shareholders  equity.

NOTE J - INCOME TAXES  

The Joint Venture is
registered in the PRC, and is therefore subject to state and local income taxes within the PRC at the applicable tax rate on the
taxable income as reported in the PRC statutory financial statements in accordance with relevant income tax laws. 

In 2015, the Joint Venture
was awarded the Chinese government's  High-Tech Enterprise  designation for a third time, which is valid for three
years and it continues to be taxed at the 15% tax rate in 2015, 2016 and 2017. 

15   

The reconciliation
of the effective income tax rate of the Company to the statutory income tax rate in the PRC for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

Income taxes are calculated
on a separate entity basis. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. There currently is no
tax benefit recorded for the United States. The tax authority may examine the tax returns of the Company three years after the
year ended December 31, 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no penalties and interest, which generally
are recorded in the general and administrative expenses or in the tax expenses. The provisions for income taxes for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are summarized as follows: 

16   

ASC 740-10 requires recognition
and measurement of uncertain income tax positions using a  more-likely-than-not  approach. The management evaluated
the Company s tax positions and considered that no provision for uncertainty in income taxes was necessary as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

30, 2016, as compared to $15.3 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of $5.4 million or 35.3%. The increase was mainly

expenses were $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $5.6 million for the same period of 2015,
a decrease of $0.7 million or 12.5%. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts during this
quarter. General and administrative expenses were $16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to $15.8 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of $0.9 million or 5.7%. The increase was mainly due to the increase
in allowance for doubtful accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

24   

Other Operating Income  

Other operating income
was $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0.07 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of $0.23 million. Other operating income was $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as
compared to $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.5 million. The increase was mainly due
to an increase in sales of raw material scrap. 

Depreciation and Amortization   

Depreciation and amortization
expense was $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, same as the amount $1.9 million for the same period of
2015. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with
that of $5.8 million for the same period of 2015, a decrease of $0.4 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense
was primarily due to the fact that more production equipment was depreciated to residual value and stopped being further depreciated
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Interest income   

The interest income for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased by $0.13 million to $0.03million from $0.16 million for the same period
of 2015. The interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased by $0.3 million to $1.0 million from
$0.7 million for the same period of 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased short term investments during the period. 

Interest Expenses   

The interest expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased by $0.2 million to $0.2 million from $0.4 million for the same period
of 2015. The interest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased by $0.3 million to $0.5 million from
$0.8 million for the same period of 2015, mainly due to decreased interest rate and decreased amount of average loans outstanding
during the period. In addition, the interest expenses related to the discount of bank acceptance notes received from customers
also decreased. 

Income Tax   

The Joint Venture is
registered in the PRC, and is therefore subject to state and local income taxes within the PRC at the applicable tax rate on the
taxable income as reported in the PRC statutory financial statements in accordance with relevant income tax laws. 

25   

In 2009, the Joint Venture
was awarded the Chinese government's  High-Tech Enterprise  designation. The High-Tech Enterprise certificate is
valid for three years and provides for a reduced tax rate for years 2009 through 2011. In December 2012, the Joint Venture
passed the re-assessment of the High-Tech Enterprise certificate by the government, according to the relevant PRC income tax laws.
Accordingly, it continued to be taxed at a 15% rate in 2012 through 2014. The Company used a tax rate of 25% for the first three
quarters of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Joint Venture passed the re-assessment by the government, based on PRC
income tax laws. Accordingly, it continues to be taxed at the 15% tax rate in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The current income tax rate
used by the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is 15%. 

Income tax expense was
$0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30,
2015. Income tax expense was $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling
Interest in Subsidiaries  

Non-controlling interest
in subsidiaries represents a 10% non-controlling interest in Ruian and 40% non-controlling interest in SIH, in each case held by
our joint venture partners. On December 15, 2015, the Company disposed of its entire 60% equity interest in SIH. Net income
attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries amounted to both $0.4 million for the third fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest in subsidiaries amounted to $1.2 million and $0.7 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Net Income Attributable to Stockholders  

The net income attributable
to stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, increased by $1.2 million, to $3.2 million from $2.0 million
for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 due to the factors discussed above. The net income attributable to stockholders
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased by $3.5 million, to $10.9 million from $7.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 due to the factors discussed above. Earnings per share ( EPS ), both basic and diluted,
for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $0.17 and $0.11, respectively. EPS, both basic and diluted, for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $0.57 and $0.38, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increased
sales and gross profit. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION   

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

As of September 30, 2016,
the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $7.5 million, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $30.2 million as of December
31, 2015. The Company had working capital of $97.5 million on September 30, 2016, as compared to working capital of $169.8 million
on December 31, 2015, reflecting current ratios of 1.80:1 and 2.73:1, respectively. 

26   

OPERATING - Net cash provided
by operating activities was $3.3 million for nine months ended September 30, 2016 a decrease of $35.7 million, as compared
with $39.0 million of net cash provided in operating activities in the same period in 2015. Such decrease was primarily due to
the increased cash outflow resulted by changes in bank acceptance notes from customers and accounts receivable. 

INVESTING - During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expended net cash of $44.1 million in investing activities mainly for short
term investments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company used net cash of $57.4 million in investing activities. 

FINANCING - During the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the cash used in financing activities was $70.4 million. Cash provided by financing
activities was $10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company has taken
a number of steps to improve the management of its cash flow. We place more emphasis on collection of accounts receivable from
our customers. We maintain good relationships with local banks. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated
cash flow generated from operations and our bank lines of credit will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements
for the foreseeable future. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   

As of September 30,
2016, we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures or have any transactions, obligations or relationships
that could be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. 

According to the laws
of China, the government owns all the land in China. Companies and individuals are authorized to possess and use the land only
through land use rights granted by the Chinese government. The Company purchased the land use rights from the Ruili Group, a related
party. The Company also purchased the buildings on the land in the same transaction. The purchase price of land use right and building
amounted to approximately $20 million. 

The Company has been
negotiating with the government for a reduction in or exemption from the tax being sought by the government in connection with
the transfer of the land use rights. Because of the change in personnel of the local government, there is no new development of
negotiations regarding taxes related to the land use rights. Due to the lack of resolution of that issue, the land use right certificate
and the property ownership certificate have not been issued to the Company. There is no assurance that we can conclude the negotiations
with the government and obtain a favorable result. We plan to conclude negotiations with the government and to obtain the land
use rights certificate as soon as practicable. 

Even if the Company
is unable to timely resolve obtain the land use right certificate for the land and related building, the Company believes that
there will be no potential adverse implication on the Company for the following reasons. 

27   

1.       
The Company acquired the land use rights in a transaction between the Company and the Ruili Group, a related party. The Ruili Group,
as the original land use right owner, has granted the land use right to the Company by contract which is supported by valid consideration. 

2.       
No third party would oppose the Company s use of the land, because no third party has any interest in the land use right
or property ownership right, other than the Ruili Group and the government. 

a)       
The Ruili Group promised that the Company has the right to use the land and related building, even before the land use certificate
is transferred. 

b)       
According to the laws of China, the government owns all the land and the buildings attached to the land in China. Once the land
use right is granted to Ruili Group, Ruili Group has the right to assign its land use rights to any third parties, including the
Company, without interference from the government. Therefore, it is unlikely that the government will oppose the Company s
right to use the land and related building. 

c)       The
Company has reserved tax payables in the amount of RMB 4,560,000 (approximately US$724,580) on its consolidated balance sheets
under the line item  accrued expenses  as if no reduction or exemption of tax is approved. This amount was determined
based on a 3% tax rate on the consideration paid for the land use right in the transaction, which the Company considered as the
most probable amount of tax liability. This amount also represented the maximum amount of tax the Company expects to pay if the
negotiation with the local government ultimately is not successful. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  

As of September 30, 2016,
we had no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:  

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports pursuant to the Exchange

is accumulated and communicated to us, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating
whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that we adopt outweigh their costs. As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b)
of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of September 30, 2016 was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and the Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ),
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO,
concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2016, were effective, in all material
respects, for the purpose stated above. 

28   

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:  

There were no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
