Note
1   Organization and Significant Accounting Policies    

Jensyn
Acquisition Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated in Delaware on October 8, 2014 as a  blank check  company
whose objective is to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization
or other similar business combination, one or more operating businesses (a  Business Combination ).  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had not yet commenced any meaningful operations. All activity through September 30, 2016 relates
to the Company s formation, the initial public offering ( Public Offering ) described below (See Note 2), general
corporate matters and identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates. The Company has selected December 31 as its
fiscal year-end.  

The
registration statement for the Company s Public Offering was declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  SEC ) on March 2, 2016 (the  Registration Statement ). The Company intends to finance
a Business Combination with proceeds from the $39,000,000 Public Offering (excluding the underwriter s overallotment option
  Note 2) and a $2,945,000 private placement (Note 2). Upon the closing of the Public Offering and the private placement,
$40,365,000 was held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer   Trust Company acting as trustee (the  Trust
Account ) as discussed below.  

$40,365,000
has been placed in the Trust Account in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer
  Trust Company, as trustee. The funds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so that the Company
is not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds
held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be
released from the Trust Account until the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination or the redemption of 100%
of the outstanding public shares if the Company has not completed a Business Combination in the required time period. The proceeds
held in the Trust Account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which the Company completes
the initial Business Combination to the extent not used to pay converting stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration
to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business. At September 30, 2016 the Trust
Account consists of investments in United States government treasury bills or in money market funds in one financial institution.  

The
Company has until 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering to consummate the initial Business Combination. However, if
the Company anticipates that the initial Business Combination cannot be consummated within 18 months, the Company may extend the
period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to
24 months to complete a Business Combination). The Company s ability to extend the time available to consummate the initial
Business Combination will be conditioned upon the deposit by the initial stockholders or their affiliates or designees into the
Trust Account of $200,000 prior to the applicable deadline for each three-month extension. The Company s initial stockholders
and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to extend the time to complete the initial Business
Combination. If the Company is unable to consummate the initial Business Combination within such time period, the Company will,
as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of its outstanding public shares for a pro
rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in
the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, the
Company may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims
of its public stockholders. In the event of the Company s dissolution and liquidation, the public warrants and public rights
(see Note 2) will expire and will be worthless.  

Jensyn
Acquisition Corp.  

  Notes
to Condensed Financial Statements  

The
Company will consummate the initial Business Combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount
that would cause net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that the Public Offering is not subject to Rule 419 promulgated
under the Securities Act). The Company will either (1) seek stockholder approval of the initial Business Combination at a meeting
called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against
the proposed Business Combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net
of taxes payable), or (2) provide Company stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to the Company by means of a
tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein.
The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of the proposed Business Combination or allow stockholders
to sell their shares in a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of
factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require seeking stockholder
approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with
their initial Business Combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial Business
Combinations even when a vote is not required by law, the Company will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and
allow stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. In that case, the Company will file tender
offer documents with the SEC that will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business
Combination as is required under the SEC s proxy rules.  

The
initial per public share redemption or conversion price will be $10.35 per share. However, the Company may not be able to distribute
such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of its public stockholders.  

Liquidity   

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had $20,297 in cash and a working capital deficiency of $899,164. Further, the Company has incurred
and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. Based on funding commitments
from the Principal Shareholders (see Note 3), the Company believes it will have sufficient funding to meet its obligations through
at least September 30, 2017.  

Basis
of Presentation   

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring adjustments) necessary to fairly present the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts therein.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results in future periods may differ from those estimates.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has
been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required
by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the Company s financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are contained in the
Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily
indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year.  

Financial
Instruments   

The
fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820,  Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures,  approximates the carrying amounts represented in the condensed balance sheets. The
Company s investment in the Trust Account includes investments in United States government treasury bills accounted for
as held-to-maturity securities and are recorded at their amortized cost.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Offering
Costs   

The
Company complies with the requirements of FASB ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 5A  Expenses
of Offering.  Offering costs of approximately $2,696,501, consisting principally of underwriter discounts of $1,950,000
(including approximately $780,000 of which payment is deferred) and approximately $746,501 of private placement fees and professional,
printing, filing, regulatory and other costs have been charged to additional paid-in capital upon completion of the Public Offering.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ). ASC 740 requires the recognition
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis
of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC
740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred
tax assets will not be realized.  

ASC
740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not
to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Based on the Company s evaluation, it has been
concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company s condensed financial
statements. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions would be sustained on audit and does not anticipate
any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position.  

The
Company s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such expense as a component of
income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties or interest as of September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, there
are no uncertain tax positions.  

Common
Stock Subject to Possible Redemption   

The
Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible conversion or redemption in accordance with ASC 480  Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity.  Common stock subject to mandatory conversion (if any) is classified as a liability instrument
and is measured at fair value. Conditionally convertible common stock (including common stock that features conversion rights
that are either within the control of the holder or subject to conversion upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within
the Company s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders 
equity.  

All
of the 3,900,000 common shares sold as part of a Unit in the Public Offering (the  Public Shares ) contain a redemption
feature which allows for the redemption of common shares under the Company s Liquidation or Tender Offer/Stockholder Approval
provisions. In accordance with ASC 480, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require the security
to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all
of the entity s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the Company did not specify a
maximum redemption threshold, its certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will it redeem its Public Shares in an
amount that would cause its net tangible assets (stockholders  equity) to be less than $5,000,001.  

The
Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and will adjust the carrying value of the security to
equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common
stock shall be affected by charges against retained earnings.  

Accordingly,
at September 30, 2016, 3,263,166 of the 5,169,500 common shares outstanding were classified outside of permanent equity at their
redemption value.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material
effect on the accompanying condensed financial statements.  

Note
2   The Offering    

The
Public Offering called for the Company to offer for public sale up to 4,485,000 Units at a proposed offering price of $10.00 per
unit. Each unit had a price of $10.00 and consisted of one share of common stock, one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share
of common stock automatically on the consummation of a Business Combination, and one warrant (a  Unit ). Each warrant
entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per full share, subject to
certain adjustments. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination
and 12 months from closing of the Public Offering, and will expire five years after the completion of the Business Combination
or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.  

On
March 7, 2016, the Company closed on the Public Offering and sale of 3,900,000 Units to the public (the  Public Stockholders )
at a price of $10.00 per Unit.  

Simultaneous
with the closing of the Public Offering, the Company closed on the private placement of 294,500 private units (inclusive of the
Public Offering, the  Total Offering ). The private placement included a sale of 275,000 private units to Jensyn Capital,
LLC, an entity controlled by insiders, and 19,500 private units to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (and/or their respective designees)
at $10.00 per unit for a total purchase price of $2,945,000. Jensyn Capital, LLC and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC also agreed
that if the over-allotment option was exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they or their designee would purchase
from the Company at a price of $10.00 per unit the number of private units (up to a maximum of 38,025 private units) necessary
to maintain in the Trust Account described below an amount equal to $10.35 per share of common stock sold to the public in the
Public Offering. In April 2016, the underwriter elected not to exercise the over-allotment option.  

The
private units are identical to the Units sold in the Public Offering (the  Private Units ). However, Jensyn Capital,
LLC and its transferees agreed (A) to vote their private shares and any public shares acquired in or after the Public Offering
in favor of any proposed Business Combination, (B) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Company s certificate
of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares
if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or
24 months, as applicable), unless the Company provides its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of
common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on
deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to
pay franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, (C) not to convert any shares (including
the private shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve the
Company s proposed initial Business Combination (or sell any shares they hold to the Company in a tender offer in connection
with a proposed initial Business Combination) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Company s certificate of incorporation
relating to the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares if the Company does
not complete the initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or 24 months, if the period
of time within which the Company can complete a Business Combination is extended by the full amount as described herein) and (D)
that the private shares shall not be entitled to be redeemed for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account if
a Business Combination is not consummated. Additionally, the Company s insiders (and/or their designees) have agreed not
to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except to the same permitted transferees as the
insider shares and provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees of the insider
shares must agree to, each as described above) until the completion of the initial Business Combination.

  Notes
to Condensed Financial Statements  

The
Company also granted Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, the representative of the underwriters (the  Representative ),
a 45-day option to purchase up to 585,000 Units (over and above the 3,900,000 Units referred to above) solely to cover over-allotments,
if any. In April 2016, the Representative elected to not exercise this option.  

If
the Company is unable to consummate a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering, or 24 months
from the closing of the Public Offering (if the two three-month extension periods are exercised) it will redeem 100% of the shares
held by Public Stockholders using the funds in the Trust Account described above. In such event, the rights and warrants held
by Public Stockholders will expire and be worthless.  

The
Company paid an underwriting discount of 3.0% of the per Unit offering price to the underwriters at the closing of the Public
Offering (approximately $1,170,000), with an additional fee (the  Deferred Discount ) of 2.0% of the gross offering
proceeds payable upon the Company s completion of a Business Combination (approximately $780,000). The Deferred Discount
will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event the Company completes its
initial Business Combination.  

At
the closing of the Public Offering, the Company issued a unit purchase option ( UPO ), for $100, to the Representative
to purchase 390,000 Units. The UPO will be exercisable at any time, in whole or in part, during the period commencing on the later
of the first anniversary of the effective date of the Public Offering registration statement and the closing of Business Combination
and terminating on the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the Public Offering registration statement at a price per Unit
equal to 120% of the offering price of the Units.  

The
Company accounted for the fair value of the UPO as an expense of the Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to shareholders 
equity. The Company estimated that the fair value of the UPO was approximately $1,033,500 (or $2.65 per unit) using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The fair value of the UPO was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected
volatility of 35%, (2) risk-free interest rate of 1.42%, (3) expected life of five years and (4) zero dividends. The purchase
option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and expires five years from the effective
date of the registration statement. The option and the 390,000 units, as well as the 429,000 shares of common stock and 390,000
warrants, and 180,000 shares underlying such warrants, that may be issued upon exercise of the option, have been deemed compensation
by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up (subject to specified exceptions) pursuant to Rule 5110(g)(1) of FINRA s
Rules, during which time the option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated, or be subject of any hedging,
short sale, derivative or put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the securities. Additionally,
the option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a one-year period (including the foregoing 180-day
period) following the effective date of the registration statement except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating
in the offering and their bona fide officers or partners. The option grants to holders one demand right and  piggy back 
rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the effective date of the registration statement with respect to
the registration under the Securities Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. The
Company will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which will
be paid for by the holders themselves. The exercise price and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted
in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation.
However, the option will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price.

3   Related Party Transactions    

At
December 31, 2015 the four principal stockholders (the  Principal Shareholders ) of the Company and Jensyn Capital,
LLC, an affiliate owned by the Principal Shareholders (collectively, the  Insider Shareholders ), held an aggregate
of 1,150,000 shares of common stock (the  Insider Shares ) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,029 or approximately
$0.02 per share. During the period from January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2016, the Principal Shareholders forfeited 28,750 shares
of common stock and transferred an aggregate of 136,864 shares to Directors, Jensyn Capital, and other transferees (all Permitted
Transferees as defined in the Registration Statement). In addition, the Insider Shareholders forfeited an additional 146,250 shares
in April 2016, since the underwriter s over-allotment option was not exercised.

The
Insider Shares are identical to the shares of common stock included in the Units sold in the Public Offering. However, the Insider
Shareholders and their transferees have agreed (A) to vote their Insider Shares and any public shares acquired in or after the
Public Offering in favor of any proposed Business Combination, (B) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Certificate
of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of Company s obligation to redeem 100% of its shares held by
Public Stockholders if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the
Public Offering (or 24 months, as applicable), unless it provides Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares
of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then
on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released
to pay franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, (C) not to convert any shares (including
the Insider Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve the
proposed initial Business Combination or a vote to amend the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation relating to the substance
or timing of Company s obligation to redeem 100% of its shares held by Public Shareholders if the Company does not complete
the initial Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering (or 24 months, as applicable) and (D)
that the Insider Shares shall not be entitled to be redeemed for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account if
a Business Combination is not consummated. Additionally, the Insider Shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell
any of the Insider Shares (except to certain permitted transferees) until, with respect to 50% of the Insider Shares, the earlier
of six months after the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination and the date on which the closing price of
the Company s common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period following
the consummation of the initial Business Combination and, with respect to the remaining 50% of the Insider Shares, six months
after the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination.  

The
Company issued unsecured promissory notes to the Principal Shareholders for amounts lent or to be lent to the Company up to $250,000
each. The notes are non-interest bearing and payable no later than the date of the consummation of an initial Business Combination.
It is not practicable to disclose the fair value of the Notes because they are with related parties. A total of $704,320 was outstanding
to the Principal Shareholders at September 30, 2016. The Company also owed $1,000 advanced by an affiliated company owned by the
same stockholders at September 30, 2016.  

For
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Principal Shareholders incurred approximately $32,282 for Company expenses
that are included in accounts payable at September 30, 2016.  

The
Company has entered into an agreement with an entity owned by the Company s Principal Shareholders, Jensyn Integration Services,
LLC, for office space, utilities and certain office and administrative services. This agreement commenced on the date that the
Company s securities were first listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and expires when the Company consummates a Business
Combination. Such office space, as well as utilities and administrative services, will be made available to the Company as may
be required by the Company from time to time. The Company has agreed to pay an aggregate of $10,000 per month for such services.
The Company may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by its Audit Committee that it lacks sufficient funds held
outside of the Trust Account to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with the Company s initial Business Combination.
Through September 30, 2016, the Company has accrued, but not paid, $70,000 relating to this agreement.  

The
holders of the Company s Insider Shares issued and outstanding, as well as the holders of the private units (and underlying
securities) and any shares the Company s insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates that may be issued in payment
of working capital loans made to the Company, are entitled to registration rights. The holders of a majority of these securities
are entitled to make up to two demands that the Company register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Insider Shares
can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of
common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the private units or shares issued in payment of working
capital loans made to the Company can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after consummation of a Business
Combination. In addition, the holders have certain  piggy-back  registration rights with respect to registration statements
filed subsequent to the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred
in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

Overview   

We
are a  blank check  company in the development stage, formed on October 8, 2014 for the purpose of entering into a
merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar Business Combination
with one or more operating businesses. At September 30, 2016, we had not yet commenced any operations nor generated any revenues
to date. All activity through September 30, 2016 relates to our formation, our initial public offering ( Public Offering )
described below, general corporate matters, and identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates.  

We
consummated the Public Offering of 3,900,000 units ( Units ) in March 2016, generating gross proceeds of $39,000,000,
which is described in Note 2 to the Condensed Financial Statements. Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, we
also consummated a private placement of 294,500 units ( Private Units ) at $10 per unit generating additional gross
proceeds of $2,945,000 (inclusive of the Public Offering, the  Total Offering ).  

We
intend to utilize the cash derived from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Units, our
securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt, in effecting our initial Business Combination. The issuance of
additional shares of common stock or preferred stock in our initial Business Combination:  

may
    significantly dilute the equity interest of our investors in the Total Offering who would not have pre-emption rights in respect
    of any such issuance;   

may
    subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those
    afforded to our shares of common stock;   

will
    likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among
    other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and most likely will also result in the resignation
    or removal of some or all of our present officers and directors; and   

may
    adversely affect prevailing market prices for our securities.   

Similarly,
if we issue debt securities, it could result in:  

default
    and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after our initial Business Combination are insufficient to pay our
    debt obligations;   

acceleration
    of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we have made all principal and interest payments when due if the debt
    security contains covenants that required the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves and we breach any such covenant
    without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;   

our
    immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;   

our
    inability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to
    obtain additional financing while such security is outstanding; and   

limitations
    on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution
    of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.   

Results
of Operations   

Our
entire activity since inception up to the closing of our Public Offering on March 7, 2016 was in preparation for the Public Offering.
Since the Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the evaluation of the Business Combination candidates, and we will
not be generating any operating revenue until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. We have generated
a small amount of non-operating income in the form of interest income on the funds invested in the Trust Account. Interest income
is not expected to be significant in view of current low interest rates on risk-free investments (treasury securities). Our expenses
have increased as a result of being a public company (for financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance) and the office
and administrative services fee charged to us by a related party. We expect to incur increased expenses in the future as we pursue
a Business Combination.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $51,426, which consists primarily of $22,100 incurred for
accounting and professional services, $15,920 for legal expenses, $30,000 of expenses pertaining to office and administrative
services provided to us by a related party, Jensyn Integration Services, LLC, $10,195 incurred for D O insurance, $6,862 for
other general and administrative expenses, and $184 of interest expense offset by $33,835 of interest income from the trust investments.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $10,878, which consists primarily of $4,344 of accounting
and professional services, $5,634 for D O insurance, $860 for other general and administrative expenses and $40 for interest
expense.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $290,717, which consists primarily of $164,274 incurred for
accounting and professional services, $51,118 for legal expenses, $31,500 relating to NASDAQ filing fees, $70,000 of expenses
pertaining to office and administrative services provided to us by a related party, Jensyn Integration Services, LLC, $29,956
incurred for D O insurance, $31,009 for other general and administrative expenses, and $802 of interest expense offset by
$87,942 of interest income from the trust investments.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $80,841, which consists primarily of $62,225 for accounting
and professional services, $16,655 for D O insurance, $1,609 for other general and administrative expenses and $352 for interest
expense.  

Our
operating expenses for both three and nine month periods principally consisted of expenses related to public filings and to a
lesser extent, general and administrative expenses including insurance and office expenses. Until we consummate a Business Combination,
we will have no operating revenues.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Our
cash balance as of September 30, 2016 was $20,297. Our liquidity needs have been satisfied to date through receipt of $25,029
from the sale of the Insider Shares, loans and advances from our Principal Shareholders and an affiliate in an aggregate amount
of $705,320 (each as described in Note 3), and $85,000 from funds raised in the Public Offering and private placement of securities
that are not required to be held in trust. We incurred approximately $2,696,501 in Total Offering related costs, including a $1,170,000
underwriting discount paid to underwriters.  

We
intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the Total Offering, including the funds held in the Trust Account, in connection
with our initial Business Combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto. The expenses include a fee payable to Chardan
Capital Markets, LLC in an amount equal to 2.0% of the total gross proceeds raised in the Public Offering upon consummation of
our initial Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect
our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account as well as any other net proceeds not expended
will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in
a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business  operations, for strategic acquisitions and for
marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses
or finders  fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination if the funds available
to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses.  

We
believe that our cash balance as of September 30, 2016 not held in the Trust Account and additional investment from our Principal
Shareholders will be sufficient to allow us to operate through at least September 30, 2017, assuming that a Business Combination
is not consummated during that time. Over this time period, we will be using these funds for identifying and evaluating prospective
Business Combination candidates, performing business due diligence on prospective target businesses, traveling to and from the
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses, reviewing corporate documents and material agreements of
prospective target businesses, selecting the target business to consummate our initial Business Combination with and structuring,
negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. Besides the costs already paid for, we anticipate that we will pay approximately:  

$150,000
    of expenses for the search for target businesses and for the legal, accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to
    the due diligence investigations, structuring and negotiating of our initial Business Combination;   

$10,000
    of expenses for the due diligence and investigation of a target business by our officers, directors and insiders;   

$170,000
    of expenses in legal and accounting fees relating to our SEC reporting obligations;   

$240,000
    for the payment of the administrative fee to Jensyn Integration Services, LLC (of $10,000 per month for up to 24 months),
    subject to deferral as described herein;   

$30,000
    for general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses, liquidation obligations and reserves, including
    director and officer liability insurance premiums.   

If
our estimates of the costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial Business Combination are less than the actual
amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business Combination.
Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to consummate our initial Business Combination or because we become
obligated to convert a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, in which
case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with
applicable securities laws, we would only consummate such financing simultaneously with the consummation of our initial Business
Combination. Following our initial Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing
in order to meet our obligations.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations   

As
of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. At September 30, 2016, we have short-term debt from
related parties of $705,320. This debt is unsecured, non-interest bearing and payable no later than the date of the consummation
of an initial Business Combination. We do not have any capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities
other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of our Principal Shareholders a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities,
secretarial support and administrative services.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   Estimates   

Common
Stock Subject to Possible Redemption    

The
Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible conversion or redemption in accordance with ASC 480  Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity.  Common stock subject to mandatory conversion (if any) is classified as a liability instrument
and is measured at fair value. Conditionally convertible common stock (including common stock that features conversion rights
that are either within the control of the holder or subject to conversion upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within
the Company s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders 
equity. The Company s common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of
the Company s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, the
common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders  equity section
of the Company s condensed balance sheets.  

Although
the Company did not specify a maximum redemption threshold, its charter provides that in no event will it redeem its public shares
in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets (stockholders  equity) to be less than $5,000,001.  

The
Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and will adjust the carrying value of the security to
equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable common
stock shall be affected by charges against retained earnings.  

Accordingly,
at September 30, 2016, 3,263,166 of the 5,169,500 public shares were classified outside of permanent equity at their redemption
value.  

Contractual
Obligations   

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

As
of September 30, 2016, we are not subject to any market or interest rate risk. The net proceeds of the Public Offering and the
sale of the Private Units held in the Trust Account are invested in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days
or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only
in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there is no associated
material exposure to interest rate risk.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during
the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2016.

may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no
material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Registration Statement, except we may disclose changes to such factors or
disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   

The
registration statement for our Public Offering was declared effective on March 2, 2016. We consummated the Public Offering of
3,900,000 units ( Units ) on March 7, 2016 generating gross proceeds of $39,000,000. We paid a total of $1,150,000
in underwriting discounts and commissions to the underwriters of the Public Offering. In addition, the underwriters agreed to
defer $780,000 of additional underwriting discounts and commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial
Business Combination, if consummated. Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, we also consummated a private placement
of 294,500 Private Units at $10 per unit generating gross proceeds of $2,945,000. We paid the placement agent for the offering
of the Private Units a $325,000 commission. We relied upon the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, in connection with the sale of the Private Units.  

After
deducting the underwriting discounts, commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $780,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions,
which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, if consummated), the total net proceeds from
the Total Offering and the private placement of the Private Units was $40,450,000, of which $40,365,000 was placed in the Trust
Account. The remaining $85,000 was used to pay offering expenses. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may be invested by the
trustee only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing
solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act.

On
November 8, 2016, our Board of Directors appointed Stewart Martin as a director to fill the vacancy on the Board created by the
resignation of Joseph Anastasio in September 2016. Mr. Martin, who was also appointed to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors,
is Executive Vice President, Sales and Producer Development of Marsh   McLennan Agencies   Florida, a subsidiary of
Marsh   McLennan Companies. He was previously Senior Vice President and a member of the Board of Directors of Seitlin Insurance
and Advisors which was acquired by Marsh   McLennan Agencies, LLC in November 2011. It is anticipated that our Principal Shareholders
will transfer an aggregate of 4,000 shares of our Common Stock to Mr. Martin in connection with his agreement to serve on our
Board of Directors.  

As
a result of the appointment of Mr. Martin to our Board of Directors, we have regained compliance with the independent director
and audit committee requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market which require that our Board of Directors be comprised of a majority
