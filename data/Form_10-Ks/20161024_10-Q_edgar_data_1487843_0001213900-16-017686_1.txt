may turn out to be inaccurate. These forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and
beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our

1.
ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Yangtze River Development Limited (the  Company 
or  Yangtze River ) and its subsidiaries, Energetic Mind Limited ( Energetic Mind ), Ricofeliz Capital
(HK) Limited ( Ricofeliz Capital ), and Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co., Ltd. ( Wuhan Newport ).  

The
Company, formerly named as Kirin International Holding, Inc., and Ciglarette, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on
December 23, 2009. The Company was a development stage company and has not generated significant revenue since inception to March
1, 2011.  

On
March 1, 2011, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement that Kirin China Holding Limited ( Kirin China )
became the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary. Kirin China engaged in the development and sales of residential and commercial
real estate properties, and development of land lots in People s Republic of China ( China , or the  PRC ).  

On
December 19, 2015, the Company completed a share exchange (the  Share Exchange ) with Energetic Mind and all the shareholders
of Energetic Mind, whereby Yangtze River acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Energetic Mind, in exchange
for 151,000,000 shares of Yangtze River s common stock, which constituted approximately 88% of its issued and outstanding
shares on a fully-diluted basis of Yangtze River immediately after the consummation of the Share Exchange, and an 8% convertible
note (the  Note ) in the principal amount of $150,000,000. As a result of the Share Exchange, Energetic Mind became
Yangtze River s wholly-owned subsidiary and Jasper Lake Holdings Limited ( Jasper ), the former shareholder
of Energetic Mind, became Yangtze River s controlling stockholder. The Share Exchange transaction with Energetic Mind was
treated as an acquisition, with Energetic Mind as the accounting acquirer and Yangtze River as the acquired party. The financial
statements before the date of the Share Exchange are those of Energetic Mind with the results of the Company being consolidated
from the date of the Share Exchange.  

Energetic
Mind owns 100% of Ricofeliz Capital and operates its business through its subsidiary Wuhan Newport.  

Wuhan
Newport was a wholly owned subsidiary of Wuhan Renhe Group Co., Ltd. (the  Wuhan Renhe ), a company incorporated in
the PRC as at September 23, 2002. On July 13, 2015, Wuhan Renhe transferred all of the equity interests of the Company to Ricofeliz
Capital, a company incorporated in Hong Kong on March 25, 2015. Ricofeliz Capital was incorporated by Energetic Mind, a company
incorporated in British Virgin Islands ( BVI ). Energetic Mind was incorporated by Mr. Liu Xiangyao on January 2,
2015, and was subsequently purchased by various companies incorporated in BVI or the United States of America ( USA ),
among whom Jasper became its 64% owner. Jasper was 100% owned by Mr. Liu Xiangyao, a Hong Kong citizen.  

The
major assets of Wuhan Newport include land lots for developing commercial buildings that are in line with the principal activities
of Kirin China.  

On
December 31, 2015, the Company entered into certain stock purchase and business sale agreements (the  Agreements )
with Kirin Global Enterprises, Inc. (the  Purchaser ), a California corporation and an entity controlled by a former
officer and director of the Company whereby the Company sold its interest in certain subsidiaries (see note 11) for an aggregate
of $75,000,002. (the  Sale ).  

Pursuant
to the terms of the Agreements, Jasper agreed to finance the Sale by reducing Company s financial obligations of the Note
by an aggregate of $75,000,000. In addition, the Purchaser agreed to pay the remaining two dollars in cash.  

Upon
completion of the Sale, the Company operates its business solely through its subsidiary Wuhan Newport, primarily engaging in the
business as a port logistic center located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in the PRC.

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

2.1
Basis of presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all the subsidiaries. All transactions and balances
between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

The
condensed consolidated balance sheets are presented unclassified because the time required to complete real estate projects and
the Company s working capital considerations usually stretch for more than one-year period.  

2.2
Use of estimates   

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews these estimates using the currently available
information. Changes in facts and circumstances may cause the Company to revise its estimates. Significant accounting estimates
reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements include: (i) the allowance for doubtful debts; (ii) accrual of estimated
liabilities; and (iii) contingencies; (iv) deferred tax assets; (v) impairment of long-lived assets; (vi) useful lives of property
plant and equipment; and (vii) real estate property refunds and compensation payables.  

2.3
Cash and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less, which are unrestricted
as to withdrawal and use the Company maintains accounts at banks and has not experienced any losses from such concentrations.  

2.4
Property and equipment   

The
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The depreciation is computed on a straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets with 5% salvage value. Estimated useful lives of property and equipment are stated
in Note 7.  

The
Company eliminates the cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired from the accounts and includes
any gain or loss in the statement of income. The Company charges maintenance, repairs and minor renewals directly to expenses
as incurred; major additions and betterment to equipment are capitalized.  

2.5
Impairment of long-lived assets   

The
Company applies the provisions of ASC No. 360 Sub topic 10,  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (ASC 360- 10)
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable
through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. Whenever
any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair
value.  

The
Company tests long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets, for impairment at least
annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount is greater
than its fair value. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent
of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The Company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its
evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected
to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows,
the Company measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. The estimation
of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows as the rate the Company utilizes to evaluate potential
investments. The Company estimates fair value based on the information available in making whatever estimates, judgments and projections
are considered necessary. There were no impairment losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

2.6
Fair values of financial instruments   

ASC
Topic 825, Financial Instruments ( Topic 825 ) requires disclosure of fair value information of financial instruments,
whether or not recognized in the balance sheets, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques
are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard,
the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be
realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Topic 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial assets
and liabilities from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts do not represent the underlying
value of the Company.  

Level
1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  

  Level
2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
instruments.  

  Level
3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and 2015, financial instruments of the Company primarily comprise of cash, accrued interest receivables,
other receivables, short-term bank loans, deposits payables and accrued expenses, which were carried at cost on the balance sheets,
and carrying amounts approximated their fair values because of their generally short maturities.  

2.7
Convertible notes   

In
accordance with ASC subtopic 470-20, the convertible notes are initially carried at the principal amount of the convertible notes.
Debt premium or discounts, which are the differences between the carrying value and the principal amount of convertible notes
at the issuance date, together with related debts issuance cost, are subsequently amortized using effective interest method as
adjustments to interest expense from the debt issuance date to its first redemption date. Convertible notes are classified as
a current liability if they are or will be callable by the Company or puttable by the debt holders within one year from the balance
sheet date, even though liquidation may not be expected within that period.  

2.8
Foreign currency translation and transactions   

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in the U.S. dollar (US$), which is the Company s
reporting currency. Yangtze River, Energetic Mind, and Ricofeliz Capital uses US$ as its functional currency. Wuhan Newport uses
Renminbi Yuan ( RMB ) as its functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the
functional currency rate ruling at the date of transaction. Any differences between the initially recorded amount and the settlement
amount are recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency transaction in the statements of operations.  

In
accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, the Company translated the assets and liabilities into US$ using the rate of
exchange prevailing at the applicable balance sheet date and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at an
average rate during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded in owners  equity as part
of accumulated other comprehensive income.

2.9
Revenue recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue from steel trading when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price
is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.  

Real
estate sales are reported in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-20, Property, Plant and Equipment, Real Estate Sales.  

Revenue
from the sales of completed properties and properties where the construction period is twelve months or less is recognized by
the full accrual method when (a) sale is consummated; (b) the buyer s initial and continuing involvements are adequate to
demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; (c) the receivable is not subject to future subordination; (d) the Company has
transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership in a transaction that is in substance a sale and does not have
a substantial continuing involvement with the property. A sale is not considered consummated until (a) the parties are bound by
the terms of a contract or agreement, (b) all consideration has been exchanged, (c) any permanent financing for which the seller
is responsible has been arranged, (d) all conditions precedent to closing have been performed. Fair value of buyer s payments
to be received in future periods pursuant to sales contract is classified under accounts receivable. Sales transactions not meeting
all the conditions of the full accrual method are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting. Under the deposit method,
all costs are capitalized as incurred, and payments received from the buyer are recorded as a deposit liability.  

Revenue
and profit from the sale of development properties where the construction period is more than twelve months is recognized by the
percentage-of-completion method on the sale of individual units when the following conditions are met: (a)construction is beyond
a preliminary stage; (b) the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for non-delivery of the
unit; (c) sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property; (d) sales
prices are collectible and (e) aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated. If any of these criteria are not
met, proceeds are accounted for as deposits until the criteria are met and/or the sale consummated.  

The
Company has not generated any revenue from the sales of real estate property for the nine months and three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.  

2.10
Real estate capitalization and cost allocation   

Real
estate property completed and real estate properties and land lots under development consist of commercial units under construction
and units completed. Properties under development or completed are stated at cost or estimated net realizable value, whichever
is lower. Cost capitalization of development and redevelopment activities begins during the predevelopment period, which we define
as the activities that are necessary to begin the development of the property. We cease capitalization upon substantial completion
of the project, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We also cease capitalization when activities
necessary to prepare the property for its intended use have been suspended. Costs include costs of land use rights, direct development
costs, interest on indebtedness, construction overhead and indirect project costs. The Company acquires land use rights with lease
terms of 40 years through government sale transaction. Land use rights are divided and transferred to customers after the Company
delivers properties. The Company capitalizes payments for obtaining the land use rights, and allocates to specific units within
a project based on units  gross floor area. Costs of land use rights for the purpose of property development are not amortized.
Other costs are allocated to units within a project based on the ratio of the sales value of units to the estimated total sales
value.  

2.11
Capitalization of interest   

In

Income taxes   

Current
income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. As part of the process of preparing
condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions
in which it operates. The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes
are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported
amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements at each year-end and tax loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable for the differences that are expected to affect taxable income.  

The
Company adopts a more likely than not threshold and a two-step approach for the tax position measurement and financial statement
recognition. Under the two-step approach, the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, including resolution
of related appeals or litigation process, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is
more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any uncertain
tax position.  

2.15
Land Appreciation Tax ( LAT )   

In
accordance with the relevant taxation laws in the PRC, the Company is subject to LAT based on progressive rates ranging from 30%
to 60% on the appreciation of land value, which is calculated as the proceeds of sales of properties less deductible expenditures,
including borrowing costs and all property development expenditures. LAT is prepaid at 1% to 2% of the pre-sales proceeds each
year as required by the local tax authorities, and is settled generally after the construction of the real estate project is completed
and majority of the units are sold. The Company provides LAT as expensed when the related revenue is recognized based on estimate
of the full amount of applicable LAT for the real estate projects in accordance with the requirements set forth in the relevant
PRC laws and regulations. LAT would be included in income tax expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive income
(loss).  

2.16
Earnings (loss) per share   

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted
earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares outstanding during
the period for convertible notes under if-convertible method, if dilutive. Potential common shares are not included in the denominator
of the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which
a net loss is recorded.  

2.17
Comprehensive loss   

Comprehensive
loss includes net income (loss) and foreign currency adjustments. Comprehensive loss is reported in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as presented on the condensed consolidated
balance sheets are the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments.  

2.18
Contingencies   

In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out
of its business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations and tax matters. In accordance
with ASC No. 450 Sub topic 20,  Loss Contingencies , the Company records accruals for such loss contingencies when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  

2.19
Recently issued accounting pronouncements   

The
Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards from ASU 2016-15, if currently adopted,
would have a material effect of the condensed consolidated financial position, results of operation and cash flows.

following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our
financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Report. Our discussion includes
forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives,
expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of a number of factors. See  Forward-Looking Statements.     

   Overview    

  Yangtze
River Development Limited is a Nevada corporation that operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary Energetic Mind Limited, a
British Virgin Islands company, which holds 100% capital stock of Ricofeliz Capital (HK) Ltd., a Hong Kong company that holds
100% capital stock of Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise formed under the laws
of the People s Republic of China that primarily engages in the business of real estate and infrastructural development
with a port logistics center located in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China. Situated in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Wuhan
Newport is a large infrastructure development project implemented under China s latest  One Belt One Road  initiative
and is believed to be strategically positioned in the anticipated  Pilot Free Trade Zone  of the Wuhan Port, a crucial
trading window among China, the Middle East and Europe. To be fully developed upon completion, within the logistics center, there
will be six operating zones: including port operation area, warehouse and distribution area, cold chain logistics area, rail cargo
loading area, exhibition area and business related area. The logistics center is also expected to provide a number of shipping
berths for cargo ships of various sizes. Wuhan Newport is expected to provide domestic and foreign businesses a direct access
to the anticipated Free Trade Zone in Wuhan. The project will include commercial buildings, professional logistic supply chain
centers, direct access to the Yangtze River, Wuhan-Xinjiang-Europe Railway and ground transportation, storage and processing centers,
IT supporting services, among others.   

  Our
Logistics Center is an extensive complex located in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province of China, a major transportation hub
city with access to numerous railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to major cities in China,
as well as other international centers of commerce and business.   

 The Logistics Center is expected to occupy
approximately 1,918,000 square meters, for which the construction and development are expected to be completed in three phases
in three years and reach its target maximum annual profit by the end of 2021 The following table illustrates the timeframe of
our investment and construction progress.    

*  
      The percentage of construction in a certain phase reflects
exactly the contribution of the investment in that certain phase. For example, contribution of 40% of the total investment in
phase 1 will lead to construction of 40% of total value of the Wuhan Project.   

** 
     The percentage of Production Capacity shows the fraction of the target maximum annual profit to be earned under the full operation
of the Wuhan Project. The Company plan to reach its target maximum annual profit by the end of 2021.  

The
Logistics Center is located within the Wuhan Newport Yangluo Port, on the upper stream of the Yangtze River, and close to the
northern base of Wu Iron and Steel, China s first mega-sized iron and steel production complex. The Logistics Center is
expected to include a port terminal that will be located approximately 26.5km from the Wuhan Guan and 5.5km from the Yangluo Yangtze
River Bridge. The operation area of the port is expected to consist of a riverbank of 1,039 meters with eight 5,000-to-10,000-ton
berths, two of which are multi-purpose berths and the other six are general cargo berths. It is designed to be able to handle
up to 5,000,000 tons of cargo annually, including up to 100,000 TEU for annual container throughput (including 20,000 TEU in freezers
areas), 1,000,000 tons of iron and steel and 3,000,000 tons of general cargo.   

  Within
the Logistics Center, functional areas will be divided into six operating zones: a port operation area, a warehouse and distribution
area, a cold chain supply logistics area, a rail cargo loading area, an exhibition area and a business related area. The Logistics
Center will also be complemented with container storage areas, multi-functional areas, general storage areas, multi-functional
warehouse and infrastructural development, including new roads, gas stations, parking areas, gas and water pipes, electricity
lines and all other facilities and equipment to operate the Logistics Center.   

 Aside from being situated in the Wuhan Yangluo
Comprehensive Bonded Zone, Yangluo development area is amongst the third group of China s Pilot Free Trade Zone (FTZ) applicants
to submit FTZ applications to the State Council. As of the date of this Report, approvals have been granted to Shanghai, Tianjin,
Guangdong and Fujian. Enterprises within the approved free-trade zones are typically entitled to a series of favorable regulations
and policies that could help the businesses grow and succeed. However, we can provide no assurance at this point that the FTZ
application will in fact be approved.    

  Wuhan
Newport has signed a twenty-year lease agreement, maximum number of years permitted by the applicable PRC laws, and with rights
to renew at its sole discretion effective April 27, 2015 to lease approximately 1,200,000 square meters of land for building logistics
warehouses in support of the Logistics Center. The warehouses are expected to comprise of port terminal zones, warehouse logistics
zones, cold chain supply zones and railroad loading and unloading zones. The warehouses will connect the port terminal along the
Yangtze River and the railway leading to Europe, satisfying the requirement of China s latest  One Belt, One Road 
initiative. It will also be able to support large logistics companies in Wuhan and other nearby provinces which will rent the
warehouses, terminals and offices within the Logistics Center.   

Recent
Development   

Armada Financing  

On October
3, 2016, Company entered into a Contribution, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement (the  Agreement ) and an Addendum
to the Agreement (collectively with the Agreement, the  Armada Agreement ) with Armada Enterprises GP, LLC, a Delaware

within 60 days provided the terminating party is not in breach; and/or (iii) by either party if the other party materially breached
any of its covenants or representations provided however that the breaching party will first have 30 days to cure.  

Factors
Affecting our Operating Results   

    Growth
of China s Economy .  We operate and derive all of our revenue from operations in China. Economic conditions in China,
therefore, affect our operations, including the demand for our properties and services and the availability and prices of land
maintenance among other expenses. China has experienced significant economic growth with recorded Gross Domestic Product growth
rates at 7.7% in 2013, 7.4% in 2014 and 6.9% in 2015. China is expected to experience continued growth in all areas of investment
and consumption. However, if the Chinese economy were to become significantly affected by a negative stimulus, China s growth
rate would likely to fall and our revenue could correspondingly decline.   

    Government
Regulations.   Our business and results of operations are subject to PRC government policies and regulations regarding the
following:   

Land
    Use Right    According to the Land Administration Law of the PRC and Interim Regulations of the People s Republic
    of China Concerning the Assignment and Transfer of the Right to the Use of the State-owned Land in the Urban Areas, individuals
    and companies are permitted to acquire rights to use urban land or land use rights for specific purposes, including residential,
    industrial and commercial purposes. We acquire land use rights from local governments and/or other entities for development
    of residential and commercial real estate projects. We do not have ownership over these lands.   

Land
    Development    According to the Urban Real Estate Development and Operation Administration Regulation, the Urban
    Real Estate Development and Operation Administration Rules of Hebei Province promulgated by the government of the Hebei Province,
    and the Real Estate Development Enterprise Qualification Administration Regulation, a real estate development enterprise shall
    obtain a Real Estate Development Enterprise Qualification Certificate. We obtained the related certificates and seek to ensure
    that each phase of our projects complies with our certificates.   

Project
    Financing    According to the Land Administration Law and the Property Law of the PRC, the land use rights, residential
    housing and other buildings still in process of construction may be pledged and mortgaged. From time to time, we pledge and
    mortgage our land use rights and real properties to lenders in order to obtain project financing.   

Interest
Rate and Inflation Challenges.   We are subject to market risks due to fluctuations in interest rates and refinancing of
mid-term debt. Higher interest rates may also affect our revenues, gross profits and our ability to raise and service debt and
to finance our developments. Inflation could result in increases in the price of raw materials and labor costs. We do not believe
that inflation or deflation has affected our business materially.  

Acquisitions
of Land Use Rights and Associated Costs .  We acquire land use rights for development through the governmental auction process
and by obtaining land use rights permits from third parties through negotiation, acquisition of entities, co-development or other
joint venture arrangements. Our ability to secure sufficient financing for land use rights acquisitions and property development
depends on internal cash flows in addition to lenders  perceptions of our credit reliability, market conditions in the capital
markets, investors  perception of our securities, the PRC economy and the PRC government regulations that affect the availability
and cost of financing real estate companies or property purchasers.  

Critical
Accounting Estimates   

As
discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we consider our estimates on revenue recognition,
impairment of long-lived assets, and real estate property refunds and compensation payables to be the most critical in understanding
the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes to
these estimates in the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

The
following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated in U.S. dollars  

Revenue.   

We
did not generate any revenue from the sales of real estate property for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. In
addition, since our Logistics Center is still in its development stage and therefore is not yet in operation, we have not started
providing any logistics service within our port terminal and have not generated any sales from providing such services.  

Cost
of Revenue.   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our cost of goods sold was $0, respectively.  

Gross
Profit.   

Our
gross margin was $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Selling
expenses.   

No
selling expenses occurred for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3,720 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of $3,720. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease of marketing expenses.  

General
and administrative expenses .  

Our general and administrative expenses
consist of salaries, office expenses, utilities, business travel, amortization expenses (including legal expenses, accounting expenses
and other professional service expenses) and stock compensation. General and administrative expenses were $763,361 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $488,076 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $275,285 or
56 %. The significant increase is mainly because of the increase of expenses relating to professional services. 

Loss
from operations.   

As
a result of the factors described above, operating loss was $763,361 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
operating loss of $491,796 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of operating loss of $271,565, or approximately
55%. The significant increase is mainly because of the increase of expenses relating to general and administrative expenses.  

Other
expenses.   

We
had other expenses totaling $2,156,516 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to other expense totaling $733,732
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The significant increase in expenses is mainly attributable to the interest of
convertible bond issued on December 19, 2015, which was described elsewhere in the Quarterly Report. Our interest income and expenses
were $42 and $2,156,558, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to interest income and expenses
of $7 and $730,629, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. No other income and expenses occurred for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to other income and expenses of $0 and $3,110, respectively, for the three months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Income
tax.   

We
received an income tax benefit of $285,801 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $306,382 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The slight decrease is mainly due to the decrease of net loss incurred from Wuhan Newport.  

Net
loss.   

As
a result of the factors described above, our net loss from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,634,076,
compared to net loss of $919,146 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase in loss of $1,714,930.  

Foreign
currency translation.   

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars but the functional currency of our operating subsidiary
is RMB. Results of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, assets and liabilities
are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period and equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Translation
adjustments resulting from the process of translating the financial statements denominated in RMB into U.S. dollars are included
in determining comprehensive income. Our foreign currency translation loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,120,502,
compared to a foreign currency translation loss of $817,493 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $303,009.
The significant decrease is mainly attributable to the depreciation of RMB against U.S. dollars.  

Net
loss available to common stockholders.   

Net
loss available to our common stockholders was $0.02 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net
loss of $0.01 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Comparison
of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

The
following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated in U.S. dollars  

Revenue.   

We
did not generate any revenue from the sales of real estate property for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
In addition, since our Logistics Center is still in its development stage and therefore is not yet in operation, we have not started
providing any logistics service within our port terminal and have not generated any sales from providing such services.  

Cost of Revenue.  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, our cost of goods sold was $0.

months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Selling expenses.  

Selling expenses was $1,459 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $8,006 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $6,547. The
decrease is primary due to the decrease of marketing expenses. 

General
and administrative expenses .   

Our general and administrative expenses
consist of salaries, office expenses, utilities, business travel, amortization expenses (including legal expenses, accounting expenses
and other professional service expenses) and stock compensation. General and administrative expenses were $4,558,102 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,470,700 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3,087,402
or 209%. The significant increase is mainly because of the increase of expenses related to professional services. 

Loss
from operations.    

As
a result of the factors described above, operating loss was $4,559,561 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to operating loss of $1,478,706 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of operating loss of $3,080,855, or
approximately 208%. The significant increase is mainly because of the increase of expenses relating to general and administrative
expenses.  

Other
expenses.    

We
had other expenses totaling $6,471,546 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to other expense totaling $2,329,552
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The significant increase in expenses is mainly attributable to the interest of convertible
bond issued on December 19, 2015, which was described elsewhere in the Quarterly Report. Our interest income and expenses were
$174 and $6,474,519, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to interest income and expenses of $33
and $2,326,475, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Other income and expenses were $2,827 and $28, respectively,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to other income and expenses of $0 and $3,110, respectively, for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  

Income
tax.    

We
received an income tax benefit of $884,725 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $952,064 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is primary attributable to the decrease of net loss incurred from Wuhan Newport.  

Net
loss.    

As
a result of the factors described above, our net loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10,146,382,
compared to net loss of $2,856,194 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase in loss of $7,290,188.  

Foreign
currency translation.    

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars but the functional currency of our operating subsidiary
is RMB. Results of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period, assets and liabilities
are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period and equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Translation
adjustments resulting from the process of translating the financial statements denominated in RMB into U.S. dollars are included
in determining comprehensive income. Our foreign currency translation loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,913,387,
compared to a foreign currency translation loss of $682,081 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $7,231,306.
The significant decrease is primarily due to the depreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollars.  

Net
loss available to common stockholders.    

Net
loss available to our common stockholders was $0.06 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net loss
of $0.02 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months indicated:  

We
had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of $53,559 as of September 30, 2016. We have historically funded our working capital
needs through advance payments from customers, bank borrowings, and capital from stockholders. Our working capital requirements
are influenced by the state and level of our operations, and the timing of capital needed for projects.  

Operating
Activities .  Net cash used in operating activities was $1,584,395 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to net cash used in operating activities of $3,479,819 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1,895,424.
The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily contributed by the following factors:  

Investing
Activities.   Net cash used in investing activities was $1,851 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of $1,851 in cash outflow. The increase was primarily
because of the increase of cash used for purpose of purchasing equipment.  

Financing
Activities .  Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,127,682 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to net cash of $3,425,886 provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease
of $2,298,204 in cash inflow. The decrease was primarily because we had advances of $1,203,672 from related parties in the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3,587,869 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

As
shown in our financial statements, we have negative cash flows from operations, sustained recurring losses for a number of years
and currently we are not generating revenues. Over the past years, the Company has been funded through a combination of bank loans
and advances from shareholders. On January 29, 2016, we received an undertaking commitment letter provided by our majority shareholder
who is willing to provide sufficient funding on an as-needed basis. In addition, the Company plans to dispose of the existing
developed real estate properties with market value of approximately $42 million when the Company needs cash flows. The Company
believes that, as a result of these, it currently has sufficient cash and financing commitments to meet its funding requirements
for a reasonable period of time.  

Contractual
Obligations   

Jasper
Lake Holdings Limited ( Jasper ), a related party, holds an 8% convertible promissory note in the principal amount
of $75,000,000 with a maturity date of December 19, 2018. Upon maturity, Jasper may convert all or any portion of the then aggregate
outstanding principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, into shares of Company s common stock at $10.00
per share.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

On
January 29, 2016, we received an undertaking commitment letter provided by our majority shareholder who is willing to provide
sufficient funding on an as-needed basis. We believe that the financial commitment provided by our majority shareholder could
provide our company with sufficient capital resources to meet our capital needs for a reasonable period of time.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Guidance   

As
described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we not believe recently issued but not yet effective accounting
standards from ASU 2016-15, if currently adopted, would have a material effect of the condensed consolidated financial position,
results of operation and cash flows.  

Item
    3.   
       Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    

Smaller
reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.  

Item
    4.   
       Controls
    and Procedures.    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
    1.   
       Legal
    Proceedings.    

We

except, in the case of this  clause (c) , to the extent arising out of the breach by the Contributor of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Contributor set forth in this Agreement.  

8.2         Indemnification
of the Acquirer and other Parties.  From and after the Effective Time, subject to  the other provisions of this  Article
VIII , the Contributor shall indemnify and hold the Acquirer and the Acquirer's Affiliates and each of their directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (in their capacities as such) (collectively, the   Acquirer Indemnitees  )
harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered by the Acquirer Indemnitees as a result of, caused by, arising out of,
or in any way relating to: 

(a)        any
breach of a representation or warranty of the Contributor or any of its Affiliates in this Agreement or any Transaction
Document; or 

(b)        any
breach of any agreement or covenant in this Agreement or any Transaction Document on the  part of the Contributor or
any of its Affiliates. 

8.3         Demands. 
Each indemnified party agrees that promptly upon its discovery of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the
provisions of this Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim, action or proceeding,
judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such third-party actions being collectively referred to herein as the
  Indemnity Claim  ), with respect to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to indemnity under the
provisions of this Agreement, it will give prompt notice thereof in writing to the indemnifying party, together with a
statement of such information respecting any of the foregoing as it shall have. Such notice shall include a formal demand for
indemnification under this Agreement. The indemnifying party shall not be obligated to indemnify the indemnified party with
respect to any Indemnity Claim to the extent the indemnified party failed to notify the indemnifying party in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement and that failure to notify actually results in material prejudice or damage to the
indemnifying party.  

8.4         Right
to Contest and Defend.   

(a)        The indemnifying party shall be entitled, at its cost and expense, to contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings
any Indemnity Claim with respect to which it is called upon to indemnify the indemnified party under the provisions of this Agreement;
 provided, however,  that notice of the intention to so contest or defend shall be delivered by the indemnifying party to
the indemnified party within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by the indemnifying party of notice by the indemnified
party of the assertion of the Indemnity Claim. Any such contest or defense may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the indemnifying
party or the indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such contest or defense shall be conducted and prosecuted diligently to
a final conclusion or settled in accordance with this  Section 8.4  by reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying party
and not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party, but the indemnified party shall have the right (but not the obligation)
to participate in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and expense. The indemnifying
party shall have full authority to determine all action to be taken with respect to legal proceedings relating to any Indemnity
Claim for which it is called upon to indemnify the indemnified party under the provisions of this Agreement;  provided, however,
 that the indemnifying party will not have the authority to subject the indemnified party to any obligation whatsoever, other
than the performance of purely ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense or injunctive relief. If the indemnifying
party does not elect to contest or defend any such Indemnity Claim or elects to contest or defend such Indemnity Claim but fails
diligently and promptly to prosecute or settle such claim, the indemnified party may pursue such defense and the indemnifying
party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party shall have
assumed the defense of an Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge thereof
that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the
liability in connection with such Indemnity Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in connection with such Indemnity
Claim and that would not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party in its sole discretion.  

(b)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in defending such Indemnity
Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an Order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against
the indemnified party that the indemnified party reasonably determines, after conferring with its counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated
from that for money damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages.  

8.5         Cooperation. 
If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to cooperate  with the indemnifying party and its
counsel in contesting or defending against any Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or defend or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any
Person, and the indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable expenses incurred by it in so
cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall reasonably cooperate with the
indemnified party and its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim. 

8.6         Right
to Participate.  The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its  counsel the opportunity to be
present at, and to participate in, conferences with all Persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Indemnity Claim
against the indemnified party or conferences with representatives of or counsel for such Persons. The indemnifying party agrees
to provide the same participation rights to the indemnified party and its counsel with respect to any Indemnity Claims that the
indemnifying party elects to contest or defend in accordance with  Section 8.4(a) . 

8.7         Reimbursements. 
In calculating any amount to be paid by an indemnifying party by reason of the   provisions
of this Agreement, the amount shall be reduced by all reimbursements (including, without limitation, insurance proceeds)
received by the indemnified party related to the Damages (net of any costs of recovering such reimbursements).  

8.8         Limitations
on Indemnification .

8.2(a)  (but not including Damages for breaches of Fundamental Representations) or  Section 8.1(a)  (but not including
Damages for breaches of Acquirer Fundamental Representations), respectively, the Contributor or the Acquirer, as the case may
be, shall not be liable for those Damages unless the aggregate amount of Damages exceeds $1,000,000 (the   Deductible  ),
and then only to the extent of any such excess;  provided, however,  that no indemnified party shall submit a claim for indemnification
to the indemnifying party unless the Damages in respect of such claim (or series of related claims) exceeds $50,000 (each such
claim (or series of related claims) with Damages that does not exceed $50,000, a   De Minimis Claim      provided,

of Acquirer Fundamental Representations), respectively, that exceed, in the aggregate, $5,000,000 (the  Cap ).

for Damages for claims arising from fraud or related to or arising from Taxes (including, without limitation, in the case of the
Acquirer Indemnitees, Damages for breach of the representations or warranties in  Section 3.12) , the Contributor or the
Acquirer, as the case may be, shall be fully liable for such Damages without regard to the Deductible, the Cap or the limitations

Damages pursuant to  Section 8.2(b)  and for breaches of Fundamental Representations without regard to the Deductible, the
Cap or the limitations in  clause (a)  with respect to De Minimis Claims and the Acquirer shall be fully liable for Damages
pursuant to  Sections 8.1(b)  or  8.1(c)  and for breaches of Acquirer Fundamental Representations without regard to
the Deductible, the Cap or the limitations in  clause (a)  with respect to De Minimis Claims.  

(c)        Neither Party will be liable as an indemnitor, and each Party hereby waives claims against the other Party, under this
Agreement for any consequential, incidental, special, indirect, exemplary or punitive damages based on any theory of
liability (including lost profits) suffered or incurred by the indemnified party or parties except to the extent resulting
from Indemnity Claims.  

8.9         Survival .  

(a)        The
liability of the Contributor for the breach of any of the representations and warranties of the  Contributor set forth
in  Article III  other than the Fundamental Representations and the matters set forth in  Section 3.12  (Taxes)
shall be limited to claims for which the Acquirer delivers written notice to the Contributor on or before the date that is

Contributor on or before the date that is ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for
assessment of the applicable Tax. The liability of the Contributor for claims pursuant to  Section 8.2(b)  or for breach
of Fundamental Representations shall not be limited as to time and shall continue indefinitely.

liability of the Acquirer for the breach of any of the representations and warranties of the Acquirer set forth in  Article

   PURSUANT
TO SECTION 302

THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002   

I,
Xiangyao Liu, certify that:  

1.
  I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Yangtze River Development Limited;  

2.
  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
with respect to the period covered by this report;  

3.
  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present
in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
presented in this report;  

4.
  The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:  

(a)  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
    us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;    

(b)  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
    our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;    

(c)  
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
    the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
    evaluation; and   

(d)
