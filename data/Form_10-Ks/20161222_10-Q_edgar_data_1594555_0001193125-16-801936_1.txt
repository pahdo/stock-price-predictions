     Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements   
 1 . Organization, Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 Organization    HV Bancorp, Inc., a Pennsylvania Corporation (the
 Company ) is the proposed holding company of Huntingdon Valley Bank (the  Bank ) and was formed in connection with the conversion of the Bank from the mutual to the stock form of organization. As of December 22, 2016, the
conversion had not been completed, and, as of that date, the Company had no assets or liabilities, and had not conducted any business other than that of an organizational nature. Therefore, financial and other information of the Bank is included in
this Quarterly Report.    The Bank is a Pennsylvania mutual savings bank, organized in 1871, and currently provides residential and commercial loans to its
general service area (Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties of Pennsylvania) as well as offering a wide variety of savings, checking and certificate of deposit accounts to its retail and business customers.  
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP)
for interim information and with the instructions to Form  10-Q,  as applicable to a smaller reporting company. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by US GAAP
for complete financial statements.    The financial statements are unaudited; but in the opinion of management include all adjustments (consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation thereof. The balances as of June 30, 2016 have been derived from the audited financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Registration Statement on Form  S-1  (File  No. 333-213537)  declared effective by the Securities
and Exchange Commission on November 10, 2016. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2017 or any other
period.    The Bank has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance of the financial statements included herein.  
 Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements    In
preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses,
other-than-temporary impairments of securities, interest rate lock commitments ( IRLCs ), mandatory sales commitments, the valuation of mortgage loans
  held-for-sale,   other real estate owned, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.

  New Accounting Standards  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02,      Leases      .  The new leases standard applies
a   right-of-use   (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, an asset representing its right to use the
underlying asset and a liability to make lease payments. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a practical expedient is available whereby a lessee may elect, by class of underlying asset, not to recognize an ROU asset or lease liability. At
inception, lessees must classify all leases as either finance or operating based on five criteria. Balance sheet recognition of finance and operating leases is similar, but the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement, as well as the
effect on the statement of cash flows, differs depending on the lease classification.    The new leases standard requires a lessor to classify leases as
either sales-type, direct financing or operating, similar to existing U.S. GAAP. Classification depends on the same five criteria used by lessees plus certain additional factors. The subsequent accounting treatment for all three lease types is
substantially equivalent to existing U.S. GAAP for sales-type leases, direct financing leases, and operating leases. However, the new standard updates certain aspects of the lessor accounting model to align it with the new lessee accounting model,
as well as with the new revenue standard under Topic 606.    Lessees and lessors are required to provide certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures to
enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.    The new leases standard addresses
other considerations including identification of a lease, separating lease and  non-lease  components of a contract, sale and leaseback transactions, modifications, combining contracts, reassessment of the lease
term, and  re-measurement  of lease payments. It also contains comprehensive implementation guidance with practical examples.  
 The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. The amendments are effective for all other entities (including emerging growth entities as further described) for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. Specific transition requirements apply. The Bank is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of the new standard on the financial statements.  
 In June 2016,   the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)  2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit
Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  ASU  2016-13  requires credit losses on most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments to be
measured using an expected credit loss model (referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model). Under this model, entities will estimate credit losses over the entire contractual term of the instrument (considering estimated
prepayments, but not expected extensions or modifications unless reasonable expectation of a troubled debt restructuring exists) from the date of initial recognition of that instrument.  
      7  

Table of Contents  

  The ASU also replaces the current accounting model for purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. The
allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ( PCD assets ), should be determined in a similar manner to other financial assets measured on an
amortized cost basis. However, upon initial recognition, the allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price ( gross up approach ) to determine the initial amortized cost basis. The subsequent accounting for PCD financial assets
is the same expected loss model described above.    Further, the ASU made certain targeted amendments to the existing impairment model for   available-for-sale   (AFS) debt securities. For an AFS debt security for which there is neither the intent nor a  more-likely-than-not 
requirement to sell, an entity will record credit losses as an allowance rather than a write-down of the amortized cost basis.    The Update is effective
for public business entities for fiscal years after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments are effective for all other entities (including emerging growth companies as further described for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Bank is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of the new standard on the financial statements.  
 HV Bancorp Inc., will qualify under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the  JOBS Act ) as an emerging growth company. Under the JOBS Act, a
company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an  emerging growth company . As an emerging growth company, HV Bancorp has elected to use the extended
transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies.

  The following table presents nonaccrual loans by classes of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2016:      
   Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful and Loss. Loans
classified as Special Mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of prospects for repayment. Loans classified substandard have a well-defined
weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified doubtful have
all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as a loss are considered
uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Loans not classified are rated pass.    The following tables summarize the aggregate Pass
and criticized categories of Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful within the Bank s internal risk rating system as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016:

  The Bank may grant a concession or modification for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s
financial condition that it would not otherwise consider resulting in a modified loan that is then identified as a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ). The Bank may modify loans through rate reductions, extensions of maturity, interest
only payments, or payment modifications to better match the timing of cash flows due under the modified terms with the cash flows from the borrowers  operations. Loan modifications are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid
foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. TDRs are considered impaired loans for purposes of calculating the Bank s allowance for loan losses. TDRs are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in
accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, generally six months, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.  
 The Bank may identify loans for potential restructure primarily through direct communication with the borrower and evaluation of the borrower s financial
statements, revenue projections, tax returns, and credit reports. Even if the borrower is not presently in default, management will consider the likelihood that cash flow shortages, adverse economic conditions and negative trends may result in a
payment default in the near future.    As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Bank had two loans identified as TDRs totaling $350,000 and
$357,000, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, all of the TDRs were performing in compliance with their restructured terms and on accrual status. There were no modifications to loans classified as TDRs in 2016. No
additional loan commitments were outstanding to these borrowers at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.    The following table details the
Bank s TDRs that are on accrual status and  non-accrual  status at September 30, 2016:

  The fair value of the Bank s Interest Rate Lock Commitments ( IRLCs ) and mandatory sales
commitments are based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan (determined consistent with  Loans Held for Sale ), adjusted for (1) estimated costs to complete and originate the loan, and (ii) the estimated
percentage of IRLCs that will result in a closed mortgage loan. The valuation of the Bank s IRLCs approximates a whole-loan price, which includes the value of the related mortgage servicing.  
 5.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments     The Bank uses
fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement , the fair value of a financial instrument
is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many
instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Bank s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those
techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.  
 Fair value guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation
or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the
use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and
requires the use of significant judgment. The fair value is determined at a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions. Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value
of the Bank s financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the
Bank could have realized in sales transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends, and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements
subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each  year-end. 
   In accordance with this guidance, the Bank groups its financial assets and financial liabilities generally measured at fair value in three levels, based
on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.    Level 1  
Valuation is based unadjusted on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 assets and liabilities generally include debt and equity
securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities.  
      26  

Table of Contents  

  Level 2   Valuation is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The valuation may be based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.    Level 3   Valuation is based on unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.  
 The incorporation of counterparty credit risk did not have significant impact on the valuation of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value as of
September 30, 2016 or June 30, 2016.    Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 are
summarized below:

  The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Bank since a
fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Bank s assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Bank s
disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful. There were no changes in methodologies or transfers between levels during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended June 30, 2016.  
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Bank s financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2016:     Cash and Cash Equivalents     These
short-term assets are valued at their face value, which approximate fair value.     Investments (Available-  for- 
Sale and Held-  to-  Maturity)     Where quoted prices are available in an active market for identical instruments,
investment securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 investment securities include highly liquid U.S. Treasury securities and most equity securities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair
values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. Examples of such instruments, which would generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy,
include certain Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). In cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, investment securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Investment
securities classified within Level 3 include certain equity securities that do not have readily available market prices, certain municipal bonds, certain Asset Backed Securities (ABS), and other less liquid investment securities.  
  Loans Held for Sale at Fair Value     The Bank adopted the
fair value option for its loan held for sale portfolio in order to more accurately reflect the economic value of the mortgages held for sale on the Statements of Financial Condition. All mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value.
Interest income on loans held for sale, which totaled $162,000 and $112,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are included in Interest and fees on loans in the Statements of Income.  
 Changes in fair value of loans held for sale are reported in  non-interest  income in the statements of income and
amounted to $83,000 and ($151,000) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    The Bank s mortgage loans are
generally classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  
      33

  The following table reflects the difference between the carrying amount of mortgage loans held for sale, measured
at fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal amount that the Bank is contractually entitled to receive at maturity as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 (in thousands):  
   
   The Bank did not have any mortgage loans held for sale recorded at fair value that were 90 or more days past due and on
non-accrual at September 30, 2016.     Interest Rate Lock Commitments ( IRLC )   
 The fair value of the Bank s IRLC instruments are based upon the underlying loans measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the probability of such
commitments being exercised. Due to observable market data inputs used by the Bank, the Bank s IRLCs are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  
  Mandatory Sales Commitments for Loans Held for Sale     Fair
values for mandatory sales commitments are based on fair values of the underlying mortgage loans and the probability of such commitments being exercised. Due to the observable inputs used by the Bank, the Bank s mandatory sales commitments
(LHS) are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.     To Be Announced Securities ( TBAs )   
 TBAs are valued based on forward dealer marks from the Bank s approved counterparties. The Bank utilizes a third party market pricing service which
compiles current prices for instruments from market sources, and those prices represent the current executable price. Due to the observable inputs used by the Bank, the Bank s TBAs are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
    Loan Receivable, Net     Fair values are estimated for
portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. For loans that reprice frequently, the carrying value approximates fair value. The fair value of other type of loans is estimated by discounting expected cash flows using the current rates
at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with comparable credit ratings and for similar remaining maturities.  
      34  

Table of Contents  

   Impaired Loans   
 Impaired loans include those collateral-dependent loans and leases for which the practical expedient under ASC  310-40 
was applied, resulting in a fair value adjustment to the loans. Impaired loans are evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired, at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral
securing these loans less cost to sell and is classified at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of collateral is based on appraisals performed by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the Bank.  
  Restricted Investment in Bank Stock     The stock is carried
at cost; which approximates fair value and considers the limited marketability of such securities.     Real Estate Owned (Cost or Fair Value)   
 Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of
foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. These assets are included in
Level 3 fair value based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.     Accrued Interest Receivable and
Accrued Interest Payable     The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable and payable approximates their respective fair values.  
  Deposits     The fair value of demand deposits, savings
accounts, and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated discounting the contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently
offered for deposits with comparable remaining maturities.     Advances from the FHLB   
 The fair value of advances is estimated based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently
offered for borrowings with comparable terms, credit, and remaining maturities.     Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase   
 The fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase is estimated based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is
estimated using the rates currently offered for borrowings with comparable terms, credit, and remaining maturities.  
      35

   Commitments to Extend Credit   
 The majority of the Bank s commitments to extend credit carry current market interest rates if converted to loans. Because commitments to extend credit
are generally unassignable by either the Bank or the borrower, they only have value to the Bank and the borrower. The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking
into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.     6. Adoption of Plan of Conversion   
 On July 20, 2016, the Board of Trustees of the Bank unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion whereby the Bank will convert from the mutual form of
ownership to a stock form of ownership. HV Bancorp will become the stock holding company of the Bank and will offer for sale shares of common stock to certain depositors and certain borrowers of the Bank and potentially others in a subscription and
community offering.    The proposed Plan of Conversion is subject to approval by the FDIC, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and by a
majority of the votes eligible to be cast either in person or by proxy by members of the Bank. June 30, 2015 has been established as the eligibility record date for determining the eligible account holders entitled to receive nontransferable
subscription rights to subscribe for the conversion stock.

     Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations      Forward-Looking Statements   
 This Quarterly Report on Form  10-Q  contains certain forward-looking statements and information relating to the Bank
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. Forward-looking statements can be identified by
the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words like  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate,  and  intend  or future or conditional verbs such
as  will,   should,   could,  or  may  and similar expressions or the negative thereof. Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include, changes in the
interest rate environment, changes in general economic conditions, legislative and regulatory changes that adversely affect the business of the Bank, and changes in the securities markets. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company disclaims any obligation to
revise or update any forward-looking statements contained in this Form  10-Q  to reflect future events or developments.  
  Overview     The Bank provides financial services to
individuals and businesses from our main office in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, and from our three additional full-service banking offices located in Plumsteadville, Warrington and Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. We also operate a limited
service branch in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We have a loan production office located in Warminster, Pennsylvania and a loan origination office in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. Our primary market area includes Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia
Counties in Pennsylvania. Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in  one-  to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans (including multi-family loans), home equity loans and lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, construction loans. We retain our loans in
portfolio depending on market conditions, but we primarily sell our fixed-rate  one-  to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We also invest in various investment securities. Our
revenue is derived principally from interest on loans and investments and loan sales. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and principal and interest payments on loans and securities.  
 Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning
assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses,  non-interest  income and
 non-interest  expense.  Non-interest  income currently consists primarily of gains recognized from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, fees and
service charges on deposit accounts, gain from hedging instruments and sales of securities.  Non-interest  expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to salaries and employee benefits, occupancy,
data processing related operations, professional fees, real estate owned and other expenses.  
      37  

Table of Contents  

  Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive
conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. A complete set of Risk factors are described in the Registration Statement on Form  S-1  (File  No. 333-213537)  declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 10, 2016.  
  Critical Accounting Policies     The
accounting and financial reporting policies of the Bank conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the financial statements require certain
estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable, based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These
policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods.  
 Our critical accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Financial Statements as of September 30,
2016 have remained unchanged from the disclosures presented in our Registration Statement.    The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ( JOBS Act )
contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an  emerging growth company  we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised
accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with
such new or revised accounting standards. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, there is not a significant difference in the presentation of our financial statements as compared to other public companies as a result of this
transition guidance.    The complete list of Critical Accounting Policies are described in the Registration Statement on Form
 S-1  (File  No. 333-213537)  declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 10, 2016.

   Comparison of Statements of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and at June 30, 2016   
   Total Assets      Total assets decreased
$4.9 million, or 2.8%, to $177.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $182.0 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of decreases of $3.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.8 million
in investment securities available for sale, at fair value.      Cash and cash equivalents    
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased $3.5 million, or 22.4%, to $12.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $15.4 million at June 30,
2016, as a result of a decrease of $3.4 million in cash and due from banks in order to fund deposit withdrawals and for other liquidity needs.  
   Investment Securities      Investment securities
decreased by $1.8 million, or 4.7%, to $37.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $39.1 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to sales and principal repayments of $2.3 million, partially offset by
purchases of $500,000 in new securities. At September 30, 2016, our   held-to-maturity   portion of the securities portfolio, at amortized cost, was $5.8 million,
and our   available-for-sale   portion of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was $31.5 million.  
   Net Loans      Net loans increased $841,000, or 0.9%,
to $94.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $93.5 million at June 30, 2016.  One-  to four-family residential real estate loans increased $2.1 million, or 3.0%, to $74.1 million at
September 30, 2016 from $72.0 million at June 30, 2016 as a result of our continued strategic emphasis on growing our adjustable-rate jumbo  one-  to four-family residential real estate loan
portfolio. Construction loans decreased $600,000 to $2.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $3.2 million at June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of a payoff of one loan. Home equity loans decreased $400,000 to $6.1 million at
September 30, 2016 from $6.5 million at June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of borrower refinancing.      Loans Held For Sale
     Loans held for sale decreased $442,000, or 1.8%, to $24.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $24.7 million at June 30, 2016 as
the pipeline of  one-  to four-family residential real estate loans decreased slightly during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
   Deposits      Deposits decreased $2.3 million, or
1.6%, to $139.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $141.8 million at June 30, 2016. Our core deposits (consisting of NOW, money market, pass book and statement and checking accounts) decreased by $1.1 million, or 1.0%, to
$103.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $104.3 million at June 30, 2016. Certificates of deposit decreased $1.2 million, or 3.3%, to $36.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $37.5 million at June 30,
2016. The decrease in certificates of deposit resulted primarily from a $1.5 million reduction in deposits held by credit unions and banks through deposit listing services.

    Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase    
 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $1.8 million, or 46.5%, to $2.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $3.9 million at
June 30, 2016 as a result of a reduction in the underlying deposit balances, which are primarily held by title companies.      Total Equity
     Total equity increased $225,000, or 1.7%, to $13.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $13.0 million at June 30, 2016. This
increase resulted from net income of $253,000 partially offset by a $28,000 increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
  Comparison of Statements of Income for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
   General      Net income increased $11,000, or 4.4%, to
$253,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $242,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in  non-interest  income
of $374,000 primarily from mortgage operations and an increase in net interest income of $79,000, partially offset by increases in  non-interest  expense of $284,000 and the provision for loan losses of
$169,000.      Interest Income      Total interest
income increased $103,000 or 8.0%, to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of a $120,000 increase in
interest and fees on loans, partially offset by a $35,000 decrease in interest on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The average balance of our interest-earning assets increased by $16.1 million to
$171.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to growth in residential loan originations as our mortgage loans held for sale increased from an
average balance of $10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $22.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on our
interest-earning assets which decreased eight basis points to 3.27% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 3.35% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of a lower average yield on loans held for
sale.    Interest and fees on loans increased $120,000, or 11.0%, to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase resulted from a $21.0 million increase in the average balance of loans to $117.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$96.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to our focus on increasing our portfolio of adjustable-rate  one-  to four-family residential mortgages. However, the increase in
interest and fees on loans was partially offset by a 40 basis points decrease in the average yield on loans to 4.11% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.51% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to  pay-offs  of higher-yielding existing loans during the current low interest rate environment and lower yields earned on new loan originations.

  Interest and dividends on investments, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations
decreased $23,000, or 12.2%, to $165,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $188,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a $35,000 decrease in interest on mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average yield on investment securities decreased four basis points to 1.66% for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.70% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to the current low interest rates on shorter-term securities in our portfolio, which generally bear interest at lower rates than
longer-term securities.   In addition to the decrease in the average yield on investment securities, there was a $4.8 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities to $37.8 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $42.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of proceeds from maturities and repayments of securities
  available-for-sale   and $1.1 million in proceeds from securities sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016.     
 Interest on interest-earning deposits increased $6,000, or 29.1%, to $30,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $24,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning deposits of 18 basis points to 0.80% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.62% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of interest-earning deposits of $625,000 to $15.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $15.6 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015.      Interest Expense    
 Total interest expense increased $24,000, or 12.6%, to $213,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $189,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, due to a $29,000 increase in interest on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, partially offset by a $5,000 decrease in interest on deposits.  
 Interest on deposits decreased $5,000, or 3.1%, to $166,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $171,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 due to decreases in the average balance and average cost of deposits. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits decreased by $1.9 million to $133.5 million during the three months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to $135.4 million for the prior year period primarily as a result of a $3.8 million decrease in the average balance of our certificates of deposit, which was partially offset by a $1.8 million increase in the average
balance of our core deposit accounts. The change in the mix of deposits was due to the current low interest rate environment and our decision not to compete with other banks that offer higher rates on term deposits. The average cost of deposits
decreased by one basis point to 0.50% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.51% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to the decrease in the average cost of certificates of deposit. The average cost of
certificates of deposit decreased by four basis points to 1.09% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 1.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, reflecting downward repricing in the current low interest
rate environment.    Interest on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $29,000 to $46,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
from $17,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of increases in the average balance and average cost of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased by
$13.0 million to $20.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to an increase in loan funding requirements. This increase was partially offset by a
decrease in the average cost of Federal Home Loan Bank advances which  
      41

decreased by five basis points to 0.92% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.97% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to decreases in advance
rates.      Net Interest Income      Net interest
income increased $79,000, or 7.2%, to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as we increased our interest income at a greater rate than our
interest expense. Our net interest-earning assets increased to $171.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $155.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our interest rate spread decreased by
nine basis points to 2.73% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 2.82% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our net interest margin decreased by eight basis points to 2.78% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from 2.86% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

    Rate/ Volume Analysis    
 The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects
attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns.
For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.  
  For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       
     Provision for Loan Losses    
 We establish a provision for loan losses, which is charged to operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary
to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimated at the balance sheet date. In determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, we consider past and current loss experience, evaluations of
real estate collateral, current economic conditions, volume and type of lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of  non-performing  loans. The amount
of the allowance is based on estimates, and actual losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or economic conditions change.  
      44  

Table of Contents  

  This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision
as circumstances change as more information becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is assessed on a quarterly basis and provisions are made for loan losses as required in order to maintain the allowance.  
 Provision for loan losses increased by $169,000 to $123,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from a credit to provision of $46,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The primary factor that contributed to the increase in the provision for loan losses was a specific loan loss reserve of $96,000 on one residential owner-occupied loan.
 Non-performing  loans decreased from $1,145,000 at June 30, 2016 to $1,121,000 as of September 30, 2016, a decrease of $24,000, or 2.1%. We recorded net charge-offs of $0 and $1,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.       Non-Interest  Income
      Non-interest  income increased $374,000, or 37.6%, to $1.4 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily related to an increase of $414,000 in our gain on sale of loans, net and an increase of $234,000 in the change in fair
value of loans held for sale, partially offset by an increase in loss from hedging instruments of $270,000. Gain on sale of loans, net increased $414,000, or 35.9%, to $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in premiums earned based on the increase in the amount of loans sold from $46.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015
to $50.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Loss from hedging instruments increased $270,000 to $379,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $109,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015 due to an improved interest rate environment and increased volume of locked loans associated with hedging, which increased to $64.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $47.8 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The offset to the losses incurred from the hedging instruments is realized in the increased value of the loan when it is committed to the investor in the secondary market.  
    Non-Interest  Expense    
  Non-interest    expense increased $284,000, or 16.0%, to $2.1 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase primarily reflected a $130,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits and an $81,000 increase in other expenses. Salaries and
employee benefits increased $130,000, or 12.8%, to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to increases of $64,000 in salary expense
due to additional personnel added to our loan production departments (including underwriting, processing, closing and secondary marketing) in fiscal 2016 as a result of increased lending activity and $30,000 in additional bonus expense during the
three months ended September 30, 2016. Other expenses increased $81,000, or 31.8%, to $334,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $253,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015   due to increased mortgage
department and marketing expenses.         Income Tax Expense    
 Income tax expense was $118,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to income tax expense of $129,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The reduction in income tax expense was primarily due to the reduction in Pennsylvania state taxable income due to the application of certain state deductions during the three months ended September 30,
 
      45  

Table of Contents  

2016, resulting in a decrease in state tax expense to $22,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $38,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax
rate was 31.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 34.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.       Non-Performing  Assets      We define  non-performing  loans as loans that are
either  non-accruing  or accruing whose payments are 90 days or more past due and  non-accruing  troubled debt
 restructurings. Non-performing  assets, including  non-performing  loans and other real estate owned, totaled $1.3 million, or 0.73% of total assets,
at September 30, 2016 and $1.3 million, or 0.69% of total assets, at June 30, 2016. The following table sets forth the amounts and categories of our  non-performing  assets at the dates
indicated. We had no accruing loans past due 90 days or more at September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 or 2015.

     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
   Liquidity Management  . Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity
is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and
proceeds from sales, maturities and calls of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Huntingdon Valley Bank had Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advances of $20.0 million outstanding
with unused borrowing capacity of $57.6 million as of September 30, 2016. Additionally, at September 30, 2016, we had the ability to borrow $3.0 million from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and we maintained a line of credit
equal to 95% of the fair value of collateral held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which was $2.8 million at September 30, 2016. We have not borrowed against the credit lines with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and the Federal Reserve
Bank as of September 30, 2016.    The board of trustees is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to
ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity
needs as of September 30, 2016.    We monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand;
(2) expected deposit flows; (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits
and  short-and  intermediate-term securities.    While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities
are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold and
interest-earning deposits in other banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled
$12.0 million. Securities classified as   available-for-sale,   which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $31.5 million at September 30, 2016.
   Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net
cash provided by operating activities was $776,000 and $7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities, which consists primarily of
disbursements for loans originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturing securities, was $656,000 and $(4.4) million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we sold $1.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in securities   available-for-sale.   Net cash used in financing activities, consisting primarily of decreases in deposits and advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance, was $4.9 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
      49  

Table of Contents  

  We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis.
We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2016, totaled $19.1million, or 13.7%, of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with
us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or borrowings than we currently pay. We
believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.  
   Capital Management.     Huntingdon Valley Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure.
The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and  off-balance  sheet items to broad risk
categories. At September 30, 2016, Huntingdon Valley Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered  well capitalized  under regulatory guidelines.  
  Regulatory Capital     Information presented for
September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, reflects the Basel III capital requirements that became effective January 1, 2015 for the Bank. Under these capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must
meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classifications
are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components,  risk-  weightings and other factors.  
 Federal bank regulators require the Bank maintain minimum ratios of core capital to adjusted average assets of 4.0%, common equity Tier 1 capital to  risk-weighted  assets of 4.5%, Tier 1 capital to  risk-weighted  assets of 6.0% and total risk-based capital to  risk-weighted  assets of
8.0%. At September 30, 2016, the Bank met all the capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. At September 30, 2016, the Bank was  well capitalized  under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be
 well capitalized,  the Bank must maintain minimum leverage, common equity Tier 1 risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 5.0%, 6.5%, 8.0% and 10.0%, respectively. Management believes that no
conditions or events have occurred since September 30, 2016 that would materially adversely change the Bank s capital classifications.  
      50  

Table of Contents  

  The Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table (dollars in thousands):  
   
   As a licensed mortgagee, the Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
( HUD ), Federal Housing Authority ( FHA ) and state regulatory authorities with respect to originating, processing and selling loans. Those rules and regulations, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum net worth
levels (which vary based on the portfolio of FHA loans originated by the Bank). Failure to meet the net worth requirements could adversely impact the ability to originate loans and access secondary markets. As of September 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2016, the Bank maintained the minimum required net worth levels.    The Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer, subject to a  phase-in  from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2019, above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of
0.625%. The Bank s conservation buffer was 4.88% as of September 30, 2016. Failure to maintain the full amount of  
      51  

Table of Contents  

the buffer will result in restrictions on the Bank s ability to make capital distributions and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The
 phase-in  requires the Bank to increase its capital conservation buffer from 0.625% as of September 30, 2016 to 2.50% as of June 30, 2019 and thereafter.  
   Off-Balance  Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations   
   Commitments.     As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet  risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend
credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At September 30, 2016, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $28.5 million,
unused lines of credit totaling $8.4 million and no  stand-by  letters of credit outstanding. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Certificates
of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2016 totaled $17.1 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial
portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.  
   Contractual Obligations.   In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data
processing services, operating leases for equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.  
    Item 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
 Not required for smaller reporting companies      
 Item 4   Controls and Procedures     Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2016. Based on their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations are operating in an effective manner.   No change in our internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules  13a-15(f)  and  15(d)-15(f)  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during the first fiscal quarter of 2017 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
