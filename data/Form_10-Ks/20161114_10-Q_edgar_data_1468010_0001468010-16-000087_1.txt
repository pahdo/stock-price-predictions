1. Organization and Business 
  Steadfast Income REIT, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed on May 4, 2009, as a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as, and currently qualifies as, a real estate investment trust ( REIT ). On June 12, 2009, the Company was initially capitalized pursuant to the sale of   22,223   shares of common stock to Steadfast REIT Investments, LLC (the  Sponsor ) at a purchase price of   $9.00   per share for an aggregate purchase price of   $200,007  . On July 10, 2009, Steadfast Income Advisor, LLC (the  Advisor ), a Delaware limited liability company formed on May 1, 2009, invested   $1,000   in the Company in exchange for   1,000   shares of convertible stock (the  Convertible Stock ) as described in Note 6. 
  Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through Steadfast Income REIT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 6, 2009 (the  Operating Partnership ). The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As the Company accepted subscriptions for shares of its common stock in the Public Offering (as defined below), the Company transferred substantially all of the net offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests, and the Company s percentage ownership in the Operating Partnership increased proportionately. The Company and Advisor entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership (the  Partnership Agreement ) on September 28, 2009.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   65   multifamily properties comprising a total of   16,709   apartment homes and an additional   25,973   square feet of rentable commercial space at   three   properties.  
  Private Offering 
  On October 13, 2009, the Company commenced a private offering of up to   $94,000,000   in shares of the Company s common stock at a purchase price of   $9.40   per share (with discounts available for certain categories of purchasers) (the  Private Offering ). The Company offered its shares of common stock for sale in the Private Offering pursuant to a confidential private placement memorandum and only to persons that were  accredited investors,  as that term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. On July 9, 2010, the Company terminated the Private Offering and on July 19, 2010, the Company commenced its registered Public Offering described below. The Company sold   637,279   shares of common stock in the Private Offering for gross offering proceeds of   $5,844,325  . 
  Public Offering 
  On July 23, 2009, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) to offer a maximum of   150,000,000   shares of common stock for sale to the public at an initial price of   $10.00   per share (with discounts available for certain categories of purchasers) (the  Primary Offering ). The Company also registered up to   15,789,474   shares of common stock for sale pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan (the  DRP,  and together with the Primary Offering, the  Public Offering ) at an initial price of   $9.50   per share. The SEC declared the Company s registration statement effective on July 9, 2010. The Company commenced the Public Offering on July 19, 2010.  
  On July 12, 2012, the Company s board of directors determined an estimated value per share of the Company s common stock as of March 31, 2012 of   $10.24  . As a result of the determination of the estimated value per share of the Company s common stock as of March 31, 2012, effective September 10, 2012, the offering price of the Company s common stock to the public in the Primary Offering increased from the previous price of   $10.00   per share to   $10.24   per share. Additionally, effective September 10, 2012, the price of shares of the Company s common stock issued pursuant to the DRP increased from a price of   $9.50   per share to a price of   $9.73   per share, or   95%   of the new Primary Offering price of   $10.24   per share. Effective September 10, 2012, the Company s board of directors increased the amount of distributions paid on each share of the

Company s common stock from   $0.001917   per share per day to   $0.001964   per share per day, which, if paid each day over a 365-day period, is equivalent to a   7.0%   annualized distribution rate based on the   $10.24   per share offering price. 
  The Company terminated its Public Offering on December 20, 2013. Following termination of the Public Offering, the Company continued to offer shares of common stock pursuant to the DRP until the Company s board of directors suspended the DRP effective for distributions earned beginning on December 1, 2014. Through December 20, 2013, the Company sold   73,608,337   shares of common stock in the Public Offering for gross proceeds of   $745,389,748  , including   1,588,289   shares of common stock issued pursuant to the DRP for gross offering proceeds of   $15,397,232  . 
  On March 10, 2015, the Company s board of directors determined an estimated value per share of the Company s common stock of   $10.35   as of December 31, 2014. On February 25, 2016, the Company s board of directors again determined an estimated value per share of the Company s common stock of   $11.44   as of December 31, 2015. 
  The business of the Company is externally managed by the Advisor, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement by and among the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Advisor (as amended, the  Advisory Agreement ), which is subject to annual renewal by the Company s board of directors. The current term of the Advisory Agreement expires on November 15, 2017.  Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the Advisor manages the Company s day-to-day operations, manages the Company s portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets, sources and presents investment opportunities to the Company s board of directors and provides investment management services on the Company s behalf. Steadfast Capital Markets Group, LLC (the  Dealer Manager ), an affiliate of the Advisor, served as the dealer manager for the Public Offering. The Dealer Manager was responsible for marketing the Company s shares of common stock being offered pursuant to the Public Offering. The Advisor, along with the Dealer Manager, provides marketing, investor relations and other administrative services on the Company s behalf.  
  The Partnership Agreement provides that the Operating Partnership is operated in a manner that will enable the Company to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that the Operating Partnership will not be classified as a  publicly traded partnership  for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Internal Revenue Code ), which classification could result in the Operating Partnership being taxed as a corporation, rather than as a partnership. In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by the Operating Partnership in acquiring real properties, the Operating Partnership may pay all of the Company s administrative costs and expenses, and such expenses will be treated as expenses of the Operating Partnership. 
   
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  There have been no significant changes to the Company s accounting policies since it filed its audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , other than the adoption of Accounting Standard Updates ( ASU ) 2015-03, as amended by ASU 2015-15 and ASU 2016-15, as further described below. For further information about the Company s accounting policies, refer to the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 18, 2016.

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements of the Company s subsidiaries are prepared using accounting policies consistent with those of the Company. 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information as contained within the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, the financial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments that are of a normal and recurring nature and necessary for a fair and consistent presentation of the results of such periods. Operating results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . The unaudited consolidated financial statements herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations of prior periods. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company adopted new accounting guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. As a result, net deferred financing costs of   $6,697,472   related to mortgage notes payable as of   December 31, 2015  , were reclassified from other assets, net to mortgage notes payable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  Short-term Investments 
  Short-term investments consist of any highly-liquid securities that have an original maturity of less than one year but greater than three months at the time of purchase. As of   September 30, 2016  , short-term investments consisted of   $30,000,000   held in a certificate of deposit and are included in short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets.   No   short-term investments were held as of   December 31, 2015  . The short-term investment is classified as held-to-maturity and was recorded at the amortized cost on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
  Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, the Company is required to measure other assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
             
    Level 1:   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;

  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  (unaudited) 

Level 2:   quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
                
    Level 3:   prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
     When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and will classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market is not active, regardless of the availability of a nonbinding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require the Company to make a significant adjustment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When the Company determines the market for a financial instrument owned by the Company to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, the Company uses several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and will establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. 
  The following describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each asset or liability is generally classified. 
  Interest rate cap agreements   - These derivatives did not qualify as fair value hedges and are recorded at fair value. Fair value was based on a model-driven valuation using the associated variable rate curve and an implied market volatility, both of which were observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the interest rate cap agreements. Therefore, the Company s interest rate cap agreements were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are included in other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  The following table reflects the Company s assets required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets: 

Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The accompanying consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, rents and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, distributions payable, due to affiliates and mortgage notes payable. 
  The Company considers the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, rents and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and distributions payable to approximate the fair value of these financial instruments based on the short duration between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. The fair value of amounts due to affiliates is not determinable due to the related party nature of such amounts. 
  The fair value of the notes payable is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using borrowing rates available to the Company for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the notes payable was   $1,226,421,667   and   $1,118,126,231  , respectively, compared to the carrying value of   $1,219,503,264   and   $1,115,752,899  , respectively. The Company has determined that its notes payable are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 
  Distribution Policy 
  The Company has elected to be treated as, and currently qualifies as, a REIT. To maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company intends to make distributions each taxable year equal to at least   90%   of its REIT taxable income (which is determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). Distributions were based on daily record dates and calculated at a rate of   $0.001964   per share per day during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the three months ended March 31, 2016. Distributions were based on daily record dates and calculated at a rate of   $0.001958   per share per day during the six months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  Distributions to stockholders are determined by the board of directors of the Company and are dependent upon a number of factors relating to the Company, including funds available for the payment of distributions, financial condition, the timing of property acquisitions, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements in order for the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company declared distributions of   $0.180   and   $0.536   per common share, respectively. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company declared distributions of   $0.181   and   $0.537   per common share, respectively. 
  Per Share Data 
  Basic earnings (loss) per share attributable for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest by the weighted average number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of the Company s common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. Distributions declared per common share assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day during the period. The Company s unvested shares of restricted common stock contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and are considered to be participating securities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, are included in the computation of earnings (loss) per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net losses are not allocated to participating securities unless the holder of the security has a contractual obligation to share in the losses. The unvested shares of restricted common stock are not allocated losses as the awards do not have a contractual obligation to share in the losses of the Company. The two-class method is an earnings (loss) allocation formula that determines earnings (loss) per share for each class of common shares and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings.

Segment Disclosure 
  The Company has determined that it has   one   reportable segment with activities related to investing in multifamily properties. The Company s investments in real estate are in different geographic regions, and management evaluates operating performance on an individual asset level. However, as each of the Company s assets has similar economic characteristics, tenants and products and services, its assets have been aggregated into   one   reportable segment. 
  Recently     Issued Accounting Standards Updates 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (  Topic 606  ). The new guidance requires an entity to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The new guidance supersedes the revenue requirements in Revenue Recognition (  Topic 605  ) and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The new guidance does not apply to lease contracts within the scope of Leases (  Topic 840  ). In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which delayed the effective date of the new guidance by one year, which will result in the new guidance being effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and is to be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted, but can be no earlier than the original public entity effective date of fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  Until now, the requirement to perform a going concern evaluation existed only in auditing standards. The new guidance requires management to evaluate relevant conditions, events and certain management plans that are known or reasonably knowable as of the evaluation date when determining whether substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern exists. Management will be required to make this evaluation for both annual and interim reporting periods. The standard states substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect there to be a material impact from adopting this new guidance. 
  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01,   Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items  , that eliminates the concept of the extraordinary items from GAAP. The objective of the new guidance is to simplify the income statement presentation requirements of GAAP by altogether removing the concept of extraordinary items from consideration. The guidance is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within that period, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company did not experience a material impact from adopting this new guidance. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation  , which makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model of consolidation. Under ASU 2015-02, companies will need to re-evaluate whether an entity meets the criteria to be considered a variable interest entity ( VIE ) or whether the consolidation of an entity should be assessed under the voting model. The new standard specifically eliminates the presumption in the current voting model that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless that presumption can be overcome. The new standard was effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2016. The adoption of the new standard did not result in the consolidation of entities not previously consolidated or the deconsolidation of any entities previously consolidated. Upon adopting the new standard, the Operating Partnership became a VIE as the limited partner lacks substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. The Company is the primary beneficiary of, and continues to consolidate, the Operating Partnership determined to be a VIE. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , as amended in August 2015 by ASU 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,   that will require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying

amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. The FASB will permit debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements to be deferred and presented as an asset and subsequently amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs will not be affected by the new guidance. The guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within that period, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified net debt issuance costs of   $9,332,831   and   $6,697,472   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, related to mortgage notes payable from other assets, net to mortgage notes payable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , amending the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. The new standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 and allows for early adoption. The Company is assessing whether the new standard will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force), that clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be classified on the statement of cash flows. This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified payments for debt extinguishment costs of   $3,202,337   from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from financing activities as of   September 30, 2016  . There was   no   impact as of   December 31, 2015  .

Some residential and commercial leases contain provisions to extend the lease agreements, options for early termination after paying a specified penalty and other terms and conditions as negotiated. The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants. Generally, upon the execution of a lease, the Company requires security deposits from tenants in the form of a cash deposit and/or a letter of credit for commercial tenants. Amounts required as security deposits vary depending upon the terms of the respective leases and the creditworthiness of the tenant, but generally are not significant amounts. Therefore, exposure to credit risk exists to the extent that a receivable from a tenant exceeds the amount of its security deposit. Security deposits received in cash related to tenant leases are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled   $5,077,677   and   $4,672,961   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The future minimum rental receipts from the Company s properties under non-cancelable operating leases attributable to commercial office tenants as of   September 30, 2016   and thereafter is as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   no   tenant represented over 10% of the Company s annualized base rent and there were no significant industry concentrations with respect to its commercial leases.

Refinancing Transactions 
  On   June 29   and   June 30, 2016  ,   14   wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company terminated the existing mortgage loans with their respective lenders for an aggregate principal amount of   $283,313,677   and entered into new loan agreements (each a  Loan Agreement ) with, as applicable, PNC Bank, N.A. ( PNC Bank ) and Berkeley Point Capital LLC ( Berkeley  and, together with PNC Bank, the  Lenders ) for an aggregate principal amount of   $358,002,000   (the  June Refinancing Transactions ). On   July 29, 2016  ,   nine   wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company also entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with PNC Bank in connection with the refinancing of certain additional mortgage loans as further detailed below. Further, on   August 30, 2016   and   September 29, 2016  ,   three   wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company terminated the existing mortgage loans with an aggregate principal amount of   $61,575,025   and entered into new mortgage notes for an aggregate principal amount of   $63,620,600   (collectively, the  Third Quarter Refinancing Transactions  and together with the June Refinancing Transactions, the  Refinancing Transactions ).  
  In the June Refinancing Transactions, each Loan Agreement was made pursuant to the Freddie Mac Capital Markets Execution Program (the  CME ), as evidenced by a multifamily note. Pursuant to the CME, the applicable Lender originates the mortgage loan and then transfers the loan to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association. Each Loan Agreement provides for a term loan with a maturity date of   July 1, 2023  , unless the maturity date is accelerated in accordance with its terms. Each loan accrues interest at one-month LIBOR plus   2.31%  . The entire outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest on each of the Loans are due on the maturity date. Interest and principal payments on the loans are payable monthly in arrears on specified dates as set forth in each Loan Agreement. Monthly payments are due and payable on the first day of each month, commencing   August 1, 2016  . 
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  The Company entered into a revolving credit facility with PNC Bank to borrow up to   $20,000,000  . On   July 18, 2014  , the Company and PNC Bank amended the revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the potential borrowing limit from   $20,000,000   to   $35,000,000  . The amended and restated credit facility consisted of a Tranche A and a Tranche B, and

provided certain security for borrowings under the credit facility. The maximum amount that could be borrowed under Tranche A and Tranche B were   $20,000,000   and   $15,000,000  , respectively.  
  For each advance under the amended and restated credit facility, the Company had the option to select the interest rate from the following options: (1) Base Rate Option (as defined in the amended and restated credit facility) plus (i) with respect to Tranche A,   0.75%   and (ii) with respect to Tranche B,   2.0%  ; or (2) LIBOR Option, which was a rate per annum fixed for the LIBOR Interest Period (as defined in the amended and restated credit facility) equal to the sum of LIBOR plus (i) with respect to Tranche A,   1.6%   and (ii) with respect to Tranche B,   3.0%  .  
   No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . The amended and restated credit facility had a maturity date of   July 17, 2016  , subject to extension. On   June 30, 2016  , the Company repaid all outstanding amounts due and terminated the amended and restated credit facility. 
  Credit Facility 
  On July 29, 2016,   nine   wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company entered into the Credit Agreement and a multifamily note with PNC Bank (the Credit Agreement, Loan and Security Agreements, Mortgages and Guaranty, collectively referred to herein as the  Loan Documents ) that provide for a new credit facility in an amount not to exceed   $350,000,000   to refinance certain of the Company s existing mortgage loans. The credit facility has a maturity date of   August 1, 2021  , subject to extension, as further described in the Credit Agreement. Advances made under the credit facility are secured by the properties set out in the schedule below (the  Collateral Pool Property ), pursuant to a mortgage deed of trust with the   nine   wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company in favor of PNC Bank.  
  The credit facility accrues interest at the one-month LIBOR plus (1) the servicing spread of   0.05%   and (2) the net spread, based on the debt service coverage ratio, of between   1.73%   and   1.93%  , as further described in the Credit Agreement. The entire outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest on the credit facility are due on the maturity date. Interest only payments on the credit facility are payable monthly in arrears and are due and payable on the first day of each month, commencing September 1, 2016. The Company s   nine   wholly-owned subsidiaries may voluntarily prepay all or a portion of the amounts advanced under the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a Collateral Pool Property is released or the Credit Agreement is terminated, a termination fee is due and payable by the Company s   nine   wholly-owned subsidiaries. In certain instances of a breach of the Credit Agreement, the Company guarantees to PNC Bank the full and prompt payment and performance when due of all amounts for which the Company s   nine   wholly-owned subsidiaries are personally liable under the Loan Documents, in addition to all costs and expenses incurred by PNC Bank in enforcing such guaranty. The Company paid loan origination fees to PNC Bank of   $1,293,186  , and the Advisor earned a refinancing fee of   $1,175,624  .

$57,714   and   $228,409   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $5,291   and   $27,431   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, for the change in value of restricted common stock issued to the Advisor. 
  Convertible Stock 
  The Company issued   1,000   shares of Convertible Stock to the Advisor for   $1,000  . The Convertible Stock will convert into shares of the Company s common stock if and when: (A) the Company has made total distributions on the then outstanding shares of common stock equal to the original issue price of those shares plus an   8.0%   cumulative, non-compounded, annual return on the original issue price of those shares, (B) subject to specified conditions, the Company lists the common stock for trading on a national securities exchange or (C) the Advisory Agreement is terminated or not renewed by the Company (other than for  cause  as defined in the Advisory Agreement). A  listing  will also be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of any merger of the Company in which the consideration received by the holders of the Company s common stock is the securities of another issuer that are listed on a national securities exchange. Upon conversion, each share of Convertible Stock will convert into a number of shares of common stock equal to   1/1000   of the quotient of (A)   10%   of the amount, if any, by which (1) the Company s  enterprise value  (as defined in the Charter) plus the aggregate value of distributions paid to date on the outstanding shares of common stock exceeds (2) the aggregate purchase price paid by the stockholders for those shares plus an   8.0%   cumulative, non-compounded, annual return on the original issue price of those shares, divided by (B) the Company s enterprise value divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock, in each case calculated as of the date of the conversion. In the event of a termination or non-renewal of the Advisory Agreement by the Company for cause, the Convertible Stock will be redeemed by the Company for   $1.00  . 
  Preferred Stock 
  The Charter also provides the Company s board of directors with the authority to issue   one   or more classes or series of preferred stock, and prior to the issuance of such shares of preferred stock, the board of directors shall have the power from time to time to classify or reclassify, in   one   or more series, any unissued shares and designate the preferences, rights and privileges of such shares of preferred stock. The Company s board of directors is authorized to amend the Charter, without the approval of the stockholders, to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares of capital stock or the number of shares of any class or series that the Company has authority to issue. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , no shares of the Company s preferred stock were issued and outstanding. 
  Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
  In connection with the Public Offering, the Company s board of directors approved the DRP through which common stockholders could elect to reinvest an amount equal to the distributions declared on their shares of common stock in additional shares of the Company s common stock in lieu of receiving cash distributions. The initial purchase price per share under the DRP was   $9.50  . Effective September 10, 2012, in connection with the change in the Public Offering price, shares of the Company s common stock were issued pursuant to the DRP at a price of   $9.73   per share. Effective with distributions earned beginning on December 1, 2014, the Company s board of directors elected to suspend the DRP. As a result, all distributions are paid in cash and not reinvested in shares of the Company s common stock. The Company s board of directors may, in its sole discretion, from time to time, reinstate the DRP at a price based upon the Company s estimated value per share and other factors that the Company s board of directors deems relevant, although there is no assurance as to if or when this will happen. 
  No   sales commissions or dealer manager fees were payable on shares sold through the DRP.

Share Repurchase Program and Redeemable Common Stock 
  The Company s share repurchase program may provide an opportunity for stockholders to have their shares of common stock repurchased by the Company, subject to certain restrictions and limitations.   No   shares can be repurchased under the Company s share repurchase program until after the first anniversary of the date of purchase of such shares; provided, however, that this holding period shall not apply to repurchases requested within   two   years after the death or disability of a stockholder.  
  The purchase price for shares repurchased under the Company s share repurchase program is as follows:

    For purposes of the share repurchase program, the  Estimated Value per Share  will equal the most recently publicly disclosed estimated value per share of the Company as determined by the Company s board of directors. 
              (3) 
    The required   one  -year holding period does not apply to repurchases requested within   two   years after the death or disability of a stockholder.  
              (4) 
    The purchase price per share for shares repurchased upon the death or disability of a stockholder will be equal to the average issue price per share for all of the stockholder s shares. 
     The purchase price per share for shares repurchased pursuant to the share repurchase program will be further reduced by the aggregate amount of net proceeds per share, if any, distributed to the Company s stockholders prior to the repurchase date as a result of the sale of one or more of the Company s assets that constitutes a return of capital distribution as a result of such sales. 
  Repurchases of shares of the Company s common stock are made quarterly upon written request to the Company at least   15   days prior to the end of the applicable quarter during which the share repurchase program is in effect. Repurchase requests are honored approximately   30   days following the end of the applicable quarter (the  Repurchase Date ). Stockholders may withdraw their repurchase request at any time up to   three   business days prior to the Repurchase Date. On October 21, 2014, the Company s board of directors elected to suspend the Company s share repurchase program, effective November 20, 2014. On May 12, 2015, the Company s board of directors elected to reinstate the share repurchase program, effective July 1, 2015.  
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased a total of   93,939   and   289,397   shares with a total repurchase value of   $1,000,000   and   $3,000,000  , respectively, and received net requests for the repurchase of   470,377   and   1,084,838   shares with a total net repurchase value of   $5,168,917   and   $11,858,991  , respectively. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company received net requests for the repurchase of   422,879   shares with a

total net repurchase value of   $4,267,538  . No amounts were repurchased during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  The Company cannot guarantee that the funds set aside for the share repurchase program will be sufficient to accommodate all repurchase requests made in any quarter. In the event that the redemption requests exceed the Company s restrictions on limitation or the Company does not have sufficient funds available to repurchase all of the shares of the Company s common stock for which repurchase requests have been submitted in any quarter, priority will be given to redemption requests in the case of the death or disability of a stockholder. If the Company repurchases less than all of the shares subject to a repurchase request in any quarter, with respect to any shares which have not been repurchased, the requesting stockholder could (1) withdraw the request for repurchase or (2) ask that the Company honor the request in a future quarter, if any, when such repurchases may be made pursuant to the limitations of the share repurchase program and when sufficient funds are available. Such pending requests would be honored among all requests for redemptions in any given redemption period as follows: first, pro rata as to redemptions sought upon a stockholder s death or disability; and, next, pro rata as to other redemption requests. 
  The Company is not obligated to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock under the share repurchase program. In no event shall redemptions under the share repurchase program exceed   5%   of the weighted average number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding during the prior calendar year. In addition to the above limitation, effective July 1, 2015, in no event shall the value of the shares repurchased pursuant to the share repurchase program exceed   $2,000,000   during the quarter beginning July 1, 2015, with each subsequent quarter not to exceed   $1,000,000  . On August 9, 2016, the Company s board of directors approved and authorized an increase to the value of the shares that may be repurchased pursuant to the share repurchase program from   $1,000,000   to   $2,000,000  , effective on the October 2016 repurchase date. There is no fee in connection with a repurchase of shares of the Company s common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has recognized redemptions payable of   $2,000,000  , which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  The Company s board of directors may, in its sole discretion, amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time upon   30   days  notice to the Company s stockholders if it determines that the funds available to fund the share repurchase program are needed for other business or operational purposes or that amendment, suspension or termination of the share repurchase program is in the best interest of the Company s stockholders. Therefore, stockholders may not have the opportunity to make a repurchase request prior to any potential termination of the Company s share repurchase program. 
  Distributions Declared 
  Distributions declared (1) accrue daily to stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day, (2) are payable in cumulative amounts on or before the third day of each calendar month with respect to the prior month and (3) are calculated at a rate of   $0.001958   per share per day, which if paid each day over a 366-day period, is equivalent to a   7.0%   annualized distribution rate based on a purchase price of   $10.24   per share of common stock.  
  Distributions declared for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $13,767,424   and   $41,090,264  , all of which were payable in cash. 
  Distributions declared for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   were   $13,888,802   and   $41,210,771  , including   $0   and   $78  , or   0   and   8   shares of common stock, respectively, attributable to the DRP. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $4,487,297   and   $4,668,261   in distributions declared were payable, none of which were reinvested pursuant to the DRP.

  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company paid total distributions of   $13,772,501   and   $41,271,228  , which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from   June 1, 2016   through   August 31, 2016   and   December 1, 2015   through   August 31, 2016  , respectively.

The Company excluded all unvested restricted common shares outstanding issued to the Advisor and the Company s independent directors from the calculation of diluted loss per common share as the effect would have been antidilutive. 
   
  8. Related Party Arrangements 
  The Company has entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay the Advisor specified fees upon the provision of certain services related to the investment of funds in real estate and real estate-related investments, the management of the Company s investments and for other services (including, but not limited to, the disposition of investments).

    Included in mortgage notes payable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
     Investment Management Fee 
  The Company pays the Advisor a monthly investment management fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.80% of (1) the cost of real properties and real estate-related assets acquired directly by the Company or (2) the Company s allocable cost of each real property or real estate-related asset acquired through a joint venture. Such fee is calculated including acquisition fees, acquisition expenses and any debt attributable to such investments, or the Company s proportionate share thereof in the case of investments made through joint ventures. The cost of real properties and real estate-related assets that have been sold by the Company during the applicable month is excluded from the fee. 
  Acquisition Fees and Expenses 
  The Company pays the Advisor an acquisition fee equal to   2.0%   of (1) the cost of investment, as defined in the Advisory Agreement, in connection with the acquisition or origination of any type of real property or real estate-related asset acquired directly by the Company or (2) the Company s allocable portion of the purchase price in connection with the acquisition or origination of any type of real property or real estate-related asset acquired through a joint venture, including any acquisition and origination expenses and any debt attributable to such investments.  
  In addition to acquisition fees, the Company reimburses the Advisor for amounts directly incurred by the Advisor or its affiliates, including personnel-related costs for acquisition due diligence, legal and non-recurring management services, and amounts the Advisor pays to third parties in connection with the selection, acquisition or development of a property or acquisition of real estate-related assets, whether or not the Company ultimately acquires the property or the real estate-related assets.  
  The Charter limits the Company s ability to pay acquisition fees if the total of all acquisition fees and expenses relating to the purchase would exceed   6.0%   of the contract purchase price. Under the Charter, a majority of the Company s board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors, is required to approve any acquisition fees (or portion thereof) that would cause the total of all acquisition fees and expenses relating to an acquisition to exceed   6.0%   of the contract purchase price. In connection with the purchase of securities, the acquisition fee may be paid to an affiliate of the Advisor that is registered as a FINRA member broker-dealer if applicable FINRA rules would prohibit the payment of the acquisition fee to a firm that is not a registered broker-dealer. 
  Property Management Fees and Expenses 
  The Company has entered into Property Management Agreements with Steadfast Management Company, Inc., an affiliate of the Sponsor (the  Property Manager ), in connection with the acquisition of each of the Company s properties (other than EBT Lofts, Library Lofts and Stuart Hall Lofts, which are managed by an unaffiliated third-party management company). The property management fee payable with respect to each property under the Property Management Agreements (each a  Property Management Agreement ) ranges from   2.50%   to   3.75%   of the annual gross revenue collected, which is usual and customary for comparable property management services rendered to similar properties in similar geographic markets, as determined by the Advisor and approved by a majority of the Company s board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors. The Property Manager also receives an oversight fee of   1%   of gross revenues at certain of the properties at which it does not serve as a property manager. Generally, each Property Management Agreement has an initial   one   year term and will continue

thereafter on a month-to-month basis unless either party gives a   60  -day prior notice of its desire to terminate the Property Management Agreement, provided that the Company may terminate the Property Management Agreement at any time upon a determination of gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad acts of the Property Manager or its employees or upon an uncured breach of the Property Management Agreement upon   30   days  prior written notice to the Property Manager. 
  In addition to the property management fee, the Property Management Agreements also specify certain other fees payable to the Property Manager or its affiliates, including fees for benefit administration, information technology infrastructure, licenses, and support and training services. The Company also reimburses the Property Manager for the salaries and related benefits of on-site property management employees.  
  Construction Management 
  The Company has entered into Construction Management Agreements with Pacific Coast Land and Construction, Inc., an affiliate of the Sponsor (the  Construction Manager ), in connection with the planned capital improvements and renovation for certain of the Company s properties. The construction management fee payable with respect to each property under the Construction Management Agreements (each a  Construction Management Agreement ) ranges from   5.0%   to   12.0%   of the costs of the improvements for which the Construction Manager has planning and oversight authority. Generally, each Construction Management Agreement has a term equal to the planned renovation timeline unless either party gives a   30  -day prior notice of its desire to terminate the Construction Management Agreement. Construction management fees are capitalized to the respective real estate properties in the period in which they are incurred, as such costs relate to capital improvements and renovations for apartment homes taken out of service while they undergo the planned renovation. 
  The Company may also reimburse the Construction Manager for the salaries and related benefits of its employees for time spent working on capital improvements and renovations at its properties. 
  Insurance Deductible Reserve 
  The Company deposits with an affiliate of the Sponsor moneys to fund an insurance deductible reserve account to cover the cost of required insurance deductibles across all multifamily properties of the Company and other affiliated entities. Upon filing a major claim, proceeds from the insurance deductible reserve account may be used by the Company or another affiliate of the Sponsor. 
  Other Operating Expense Reimbursement 
  In addition to the various fees paid to the Advisor, the Company is obligated to pay directly or reimburse all expenses incurred by the Advisor in providing services to the Company, including the Company s allocable share of the Advisor s overhead, such as rent, employee costs, utilities and information technology costs. The Company will not reimburse the Advisor for employee costs in connection with services for which the Advisor or its affiliates receive acquisition fees or disposition fees or for the salaries the Advisor pays to the Company s executive officers. 
  The Charter limits the Company s total operating expenses during any   four   fiscal quarters to the greater of   2%   of the Company s average invested assets or   25%   of the Company s net income for the same period (the    2%  /  25%   Limitation ). The Company may reimburse the Advisor, at the end of each fiscal quarter, for operating expenses incurred by the Advisor; provided, however, that the Company shall not reimburse the Advisor at the end of any fiscal quarter for operating expenses that exceed the   2%  /  25%   Limitation unless the independent directors have determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. The Advisor must reimburse the Company for the amount by which the Company s operating expenses for the preceding four fiscal quarters then ended exceed the   2%  /  25%   Limitation unless the independent directors have determined that such excess expenses were justified. For purposes of determining the   2%  /  25%   Limitation

amount,  average invested assets  means the average monthly book value of the Company s assets invested directly or indirectly in equity interests and loans secured by real estate during the   12  -month period before deducting depreciation, bad debts or other non-cash reserves.  Total operating expenses  means all expenses paid or incurred by the Company that are in any way related to the Company s operation, including the Company s allocable share of Advisor overhead and investment management fees, but excluding (a) the expenses of raising capital such as organization and offering expenses, legal, audit, accounting, underwriting, brokerage, listing, registration and other fees, printing and other such expenses and taxes incurred in connection with the issuance, distribution, transfer, listing and registration of shares of the Company s common stock; (b) interest payments; (c) taxes; (d) non-cash expenditures such as depreciation, amortization and bad debt reserves; (e) reasonable incentive fees based on the gain in the sale of the Company s assets; (f) acquisition fees and acquisition expenses (including expenses relating to potential acquisitions that the Company does not close); (g) real estate commissions on the resale of investments; and (h) other expenses connected with the acquisition, disposition, management and ownership of investments (including the costs of foreclosure, insurance premiums, legal services, maintenance, repair and improvement of real property). 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s total operating expenses, as defined above, did not exceed the   2%  /  25%   Limitation. 
  Disposition Fee 
  The Company will pay the Advisor a disposition fee in connection with a sale of a property or real estate-related asset and in the event of the sale of the entire Company, in either case when the Advisor or its affiliates provides a substantial amount of services as determined by a majority of the Company s independent directors.  With respect to a sale of a property or real estate-related asset, the Company will pay the Advisor a disposition fee equal to   1.5%   of the contract sales price of the investment sold. With respect to a final liquidity event, the Company will pay the Advisor a disposition fee equal to (i)   0.5%   of the total consideration paid in a final liquidity event if the price per share paid to stockholders is less than or equal to   $9.00  ; (ii)   0.75%   of the total consideration paid in a final liquidity event if the price per share paid to stockholders is between   $9.01   and   $10.24  ; (iii)   1.00%   of the total consideration paid in a final liquidity event if the price per share paid to stockholders is between   $10.25   and   $11.24  ; (iv)   1.25%   of the total consideration paid in a final liquidity event if the price per share paid to stockholders is between   $11.25   and   $12.00  ; and (v)   1.5%   of the total consideration paid in a final liquidity event if the price per share paid to stockholders is greater than or equal to   $12.01  . To the extent the disposition fee is paid upon the sale of any assets other than real property, it will be included as an operating expense for purposes of the   2%  /  25%   Limitation. In connection with the sale of securities, the disposition fee may be paid to an affiliate of the Advisor that is registered as a FINRA member broker-dealer if applicable FINRA rules would prohibit the payment of the disposition fee to a firm that is not a registered broker-dealer. The Charter limits the maximum amount of the disposition fees payable to the Advisor for the sale of any real property to the lesser of   one-half   of the brokerage commission paid or   3%   of the contract sales price, but in no event shall the total real estate commissions paid, including any disposition fees payable to the Advisor, exceed   6%   of the contract sales price. 
  Refinancing Fee 
  The Company pays the Advisor a refinancing fee equal to   0.50%   of the refinancing amount in connection with the refinancing of certain of the Company s existing mortgage loans. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Advisor earned   $1,493,727   and   $3,283,737   in refinancing fees in connection with the Refinancing Transactions. 
  Restricted Stock Agreement 
  On   June 11, 2014  , the Company entered into a restricted stock agreement with the Advisor whereby the Company issued to the Advisor   488,281.25   restricted shares of the Company s common stock at a fair market value of   $10.24   per share in satisfaction of certain deferred fees due to the Advisor in the aggregate amount of   $5,000,000  . The shares of restricted stock

vest and become non-forfeitable upon the earliest to occur of (i)   50%   at December 31, 2015 and   50%   at December 31, 2016, (ii) certain liquidity events of the Company, (iii) the Company s cumulative modified funds from operations exceed the lesser of (a) the cumulative amount of distributions paid to the Company s stockholders or (b) an amount that is equal to a   7.0%   cumulative, non-compounded annual return on the Company s stockholders  invested capital, or (iv) the Company s termination of, or failure to renew, the Advisory Agreement other than for  cause  (as defined in the Advisory Agreement). The shares of unvested restricted stock shall be forfeited if the Advisor is terminated for any reason other than (iv) above. 
   
  9. Incentive Award Plan and Independent Director Compensation 
  The Company has adopted an incentive plan (the  Incentive Award Plan ) that provides for the grant of equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants and those of the Company s affiliates. The Incentive Award Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and other stock-based awards or cash-based awards. No awards have been granted under the Incentive Award Plan as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , except those awards granted to the independent directors as described below. 
  Under the Company s independent directors  compensation plan, which is a sub-plan of the Incentive Award Plan, each of the Company s independent directors was entitled to receive   5,000   shares of restricted common stock in connection with the initial meeting of the Company s full board of directors. The Company s board of directors, and each of the independent directors, agreed to delay the initial grant of restricted stock until the Company raised   $2,000,000   in gross offering proceeds in the Private Offering. Each subsequent independent director that joins the Company s board of directors receives   5,000   shares of restricted common stock upon election to the Company s board of directors. In addition, on the date following an independent director s re-election to the Company s board of directors, he or she receives   2,500   shares of restricted common stock. One-fourth of the shares of restricted common stock generally vest and become non-forfeitable upon issuance and the remaining portion will vest in   three   equal annual installments beginning on the date of grant and ending on the third anniversary of the date of grant; provided, however, that the restricted stock will become fully vested and become non-forfeitable on the earlier to occur of (1) the termination of the independent director s service as a director due to his or her death or disability or (2) a change in control of the Company and as otherwise provided in the Incentive Award Plan. On August 10, 2015, the Company s board of directors granted   2,000   shares of restricted common stock pursuant to the Incentive Award Plan to each of Larry H. Dale and Kerry D. Vandell in appreciation for their service as independent directors and commitment to the Company for their prior years of service as independent directors, all of which vested immediately. On August 11, 2015, the Company granted   5,000   shares of restricted common stock to its new independent director, Don B. Saulic. On August 9, 2016, the Company granted   2,500   shares of restricted common stock to each of its   three   independent directors upon their re-election to the Company s board of directors at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of   $35,526   and   $61,254   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $125,719   and   $171,486   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.

10. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Economic Dependency 
  The Company is dependent on the Advisor and its affiliates for certain services that are essential to the Company, including the identification, evaluation, negotiation, purchase and disposition of real estate and real estate-related investments; management of the daily operations of the Company s real estate and real estate-related investment portfolio; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that these companies are unable to provide the respective services, the Company will be required to obtain such services from other sources. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  The geographic concentration of the Company s portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the Houston, Texas, Chicago, Illinois and Austin, Texas apartment markets. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, relocations of businesses, increased competition from other apartment communities, decrease in demand for apartments or any other changes, could adversely affect the Company s operating results and its ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
  Environmental 
  As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. The Company is not aware of any environmental liability that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, the uses and conditions of properties in the vicinity of the Company s properties, the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the Company is unaware with respect to the properties could result in future environmental liabilities. 
  Legal Matters 
  From time to time, the Company is subject, or party, to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Management is not aware of any legal proceedings of which the outcome is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition nor is the Company aware of any such legal proceedings contemplated by government agencies. 
   
  11. Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The Company uses interest rate derivatives with the objective of managing exposure to interest rate movements thereby minimizing the effect of interest rate changes and the effect they could have on future cash flows. Interest rate cap agreements are used to accomplish this objective. The following table provides the terms of the Company s interest rate derivative instruments that were in effect at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

The interest rate cap agreements are not designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the Company records any changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements as interest expense. The change in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   resulted in an unrealized   loss   of   $21,570   and   $466,841  , respectively, which is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired interest rate cap agreements of   $0   and   $259,000  , and during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company acquired interest rate cap agreements of   $231,000   and   $296,250  . The fair value of the interest rate cap agreements of   $90,302   and   $298,143   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are included in other assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
   
  12. Subsequent Events 
  Distributions Paid 
  On   October 3, 2016  , the Company paid distributions of   $4,487,297  , which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from   September 1, 2016   through   September 30, 2016  . All such distributions were paid in cash. 
  On   November 1, 2016  , the Company paid distributions of   $4,636,500  , which related to distributions declared for each day in the period from   October 1, 2016   through   October 31, 2016  . All such distributions were paid in cash. 
  Shares Repurchased 
  On   October 31, 2016  , the Company repurchased   189,743   shares of its common stock for a total repurchase value of   $2,000,000  , or   $10.54   per share, pursuant to the Company s share repurchase program. 
  Distributions Declared 
  On November 8, 2016, the Company s board of directors approved and authorized a daily distribution to stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending on March 31, 2017. The distributions will be equal to   $0.001964   per share of the Company s common stock. The distributions for each record date in January 2017, February 2017 and March 2017 will be paid in February 2017, March 2017 and April 2017, respectively. The distributions will be payable to stockholders from legally available funds therefor. 
  Advisory Agreement 
  On November 8, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 9 (the  Amendment ) to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, by and among the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Advisor. The amendment renewed the Advisory Agreement for a term beginning on November 15, 2016 and ending on November 15, 2017. 
  Plan of Liquidation 
  In the event that the board of directors has not determined to pursue a liquidity event by December 31, 2016, the board of directors will adopt a resolution declaring that a proposed liquidation of the Company is advisable on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in the resolution (the  Plan of Liquidation ) and direct that the proposed Plan of Liquidation be

submitted for consideration at either an annual or special meeting of the stockholders. The adoption of a Plan of Liquidation and the submission to the stockholders may be postponed if a majority of directors, including a majority of independent directors, determines that a liquidation is not then in the best interest of the stockholders. On November 8, 2016, the Company s board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors, determined to postpone presenting a liquidation decision to stockholders as it is not now in the best interests of the Company s stockholders. In accordance with the Company s charter, the board of directors will reconsider whether to seek stockholder approval of the Company s liquidation at least annually. The board of directors, pursuant to its fiduciary duties, continuously evaluates opportunities, including possible liquidation events, of the Company.

  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Quarterly Report ) that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning investment objectives, other plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto) are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). These statements are only predictions. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees. Actual events or our investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as  may,   should,   expect,   could,   intend,   plan,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,   predict,   potential  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. 
  The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon our current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs, which involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to: 
             
    the fact that we have had a net loss for each quarterly and annual period since inception; 
                
    changes in economic conditions generally and the real estate and debt markets specifically; 
                
    our ability to successfully dispose of real estate on terms that are favorable to us; 
                
    risks inherent in the real estate business, including tenant defaults, tenant vacancies, potential liability relating to environmental matters and liquidity of real estate investments; 
                
    our ability to secure resident leases for our multifamily properties at favorable rental rates; 
                
    the impact of competition on rental rates at our apartment homes; 
                
    t  he fact we pay fees and expenses to our Advisor and its affiliates that were not negotiated on an arm s length basis and the payment of these fees and expenses increases the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment in us; 
                
    legislative or regulatory changes (including changes to the laws governing the taxation of REITs); 
                
    the availability of capital; 
                
    changes in interest rates; and 
                
    changes to GAAP. 
     Any of the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements included herein could be inaccurate, and undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements included herein. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date this Quarterly Report is filed with the SEC, and the risk that actual results will differ materially from the expectations expressed herein will increase with the passage of time. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made herein, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason.

forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report, the inclusion of such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the objectives and plans set forth in this Quarterly Report will be achieved. 
  All forward-looking statements included herein should be read in light of the factors identified in the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on March 18, 2016. 
   
  Overview 
  We were formed on May 4, 2009, as a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as, and currently qualifies as, a REIT. As described in more detail below, we own and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate investments, primarily in the multifamily sector, located throughout the United States. 
  On July 19, 2010, we commenced our Public Offering of up to a maximum of 150,000,000 shares of common stock at an initial price of $10.00 per share (subject to certain discounts) and up to 15,789,474 shares of common stock pursuant to our DRP at an initial price of $9.50 per share. On July 12, 2012, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $10.24 as of March 31, 2012. As a result of the determination of the estimated value per share of our common stock as of March 31, 2012, effective September 10, 2012, the offering price of our common stock in our Public Offering increased from the previous price of $10.00 per share to $10.24 per share. Additionally, effective September 10, 2012, the price of shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our DRP increased from a price of $9.50 per share to a price of $9.73 per share, or 95% of the $10.24 per share offering price. On March 10, 2015, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $10.35 as of December 31, 2014. On February 25, 2016, our board of directors determined an estimated value per share of our common stock of $11.44 as of December 31, 2015. For additional information on the determination of our estimated value per share and the risks related thereto, see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. 
  On December 20, 2013, we terminated our Public Offering. Upon termination of our Public Offering, we had sold 73,608,337 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $745,389,748, including 1,588,289 shares of common stock issued pursuant to our DRP for gross offering proceeds of $15,397,232. Following the termination of our Public Offering, we continued to offer shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRP until our board of directors determined to suspend our DRP effective with distributions earned beginning on December 1, 2014. Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, reinstate the DRP and change the price at which we offer shares of common stock to our stockholders pursuant to the DRP to reflect future changes in our estimated value per share and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   65   multifamily properties located within the greater midwest and southern geographic regions of the United States. Our property portfolio consists of an aggregate of   16,709   apartment homes and   25,973   square feet of rentable commercial space. The total purchase price of our real estate portfolio, including development and construction costs for apartment homes we constructed, was   $1,643,666,920  , exclusive of closing costs. At   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio was approximately   96.5%   leased. 
  Steadfast Income Advisor, LLC is our advisor. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties. Our Advisor sources and presents investment opportunities to our board of directors. Our Advisor also provides investment management, marketing, investor relations and other administrative services on our behalf.

  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 
  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Substantially all of our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership. We are the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership. The initial limited partner of our Operating Partnership is our Advisor. The Partnership Agreement of our Operating Partnership provides that our Operating Partnership will be operated in a manner that will enable us to (1) satisfy the requirements for being classified as a REIT for tax purposes, (2) avoid any federal income or excise tax liability and (3) ensure that our Operating Partnership will not be classified as a  publicly traded partnership  for purposes of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, which classification could result in our Operating Partnership being taxed as a corporation, rather than as a partnership. In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by our Operating Partnership in acquiring and operating real properties, our Operating Partnership will pay all of our administrative costs and expenses, and such expenses will be treated as expenses of our Operating Partnership. 
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2010. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which qualification is denied. Failing to qualify as a REIT could materially and adversely affect our net income.   
  Market Outlook 
  During times of economic downturn, market conditions could negatively impact the multifamily real estate sector, resulting in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values. The economy in the United States has improved; however, there is no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve or will not worsen in the future. We believe we currently have unique investment opportunities, particularly in the multifamily sector. Home ownership rates are the lowest they have been since 1967. Demographic and economic factors favor the flexibility of rental housing and discourage the potential financial burden associated with home ownership. Additionally, Millennials and Baby Boomers, the two largest demographic groups comprising roughly half of the total population in the United States, are increasingly choosing to live in a variety of rental housing. Our plan is to provide rental housing for these multi-generational groups as they age. Millennials are getting married and having children later and are choosing to live in apartment communities until their mid-30s. Today, 30% of Millennials are still living with their parents or are still in school. When they get a job, Millennials will likely rent moderate income apartments based upon an average income of $35,000. We believe this creates demand for multifamily housing.

  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC. There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies during   2016  , other than as discussed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in this Quarterly Report. 
  Income Taxes 
  We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and have operated as such beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally would not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. 
  We follow the income tax guidance under GAAP to recognize, measure, present and disclose in our consolidated financial statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Due to uncertainty regarding the realization of certain deferred tax assets, we have established valuation allowances, primarily in connection with the net operating loss carryforward related to the REIT. We have not been assessed material interest or penalties by any major tax jurisdictions. Our evaluation was performed for the tax years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014   and   2013  . 
  Distributions 
  Our board of directors has declared daily distributions that are paid on a monthly basis. We expect to continue paying monthly distributions unless our results of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions or other factors prohibit us from doing so. We may declare distributions in excess of our funds from operations. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary from time to time. However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we must make distributions equal to at least 90% of our  REIT taxable income  each year.

Distributions declared (1) accrue daily to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on each day, (2) are payable in cumulative amounts on or before the third day of each calendar month with respect to the prior month and (3) are calculated at a rate of   $0.001964   per share per day during the year ended December 31, 2015 and three months ended March 31, 2016 and at a rate of   $0.001958   per share per day during the six months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  The distributions paid during each of the last five fiscal quarters ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

________________    
            (2) 
    Assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day during the periods presented.  
              (3) 
    Distributions are paid on a monthly basis. Distributions for all record dates of a given month are paid approximately three days following month end. All distributions were paid in cash. 
     For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we paid aggregate distributions of   $13,772,501   and   $41,271,228  . All such distributions were paid in cash. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our net loss was   $9,699,187   and   $21,356,546  , we had funds from operations ( FFO ), of   $7,860,754   and   $30,367,439   and net cash provided by operations of   $14,661,164   and   $38,303,678  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we funded   $13,772,501   and   $37,415,015   of distributions paid with net cash provided by operating activities and with proceeds from our credit facilities of   $0   and   $3,856,213  , respectively. For information on how we calculate FFO and the reconciliation of FFO to net loss, see   Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations.  
  Over the long-term, we expect that our distributions will be paid from cash flow from operations (except with respect to distributions related to sales of our real estate and real estate-related investments). However, our operating performance cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors, including those discussed under  Forward-Looking Statements,  and  Results of Operations  herein. In the event our cash flow from operations decreases in the future, the level of our distributions may also decrease.  
  Inflation 
  Substantially all of our multifamily property leases will be for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally will minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit tenants to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore will expose us to the effects of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases. 
  With respect to our commercial properties, we include in our leases future provisions designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. These provisions include reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements, or in some cases annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain allowance. We believe  
  
    41 

     Table of Contents  
    
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 
  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

that shorter term lease contracts on commercial properties lessen the impact of inflation due to the ability to adjust rental rates to market levels as leases expire. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had not entered into any leases as a lessee. 
  REIT Compliance 
  To qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. We will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We have used, and intend to use in the future, secured and unsecured borrowings. At the conclusion of our Public Offering, our overall borrowings were approximately 65% of the cost of our investments (before deducting depreciation and amortization) plus the value of our other investments. Going forward, we expect that our borrowings will be approximately 65% of the value of our properties, as determined by an independent third party appraiser or qualified independent valuation expert. Under our Charter, we have a limitation on borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets, which generally approximates to 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets, though we may exceed this limit under certain circumstances. As of   September 30, 2016  , our borrowings were not in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. 
  We expect to use our capital resources to make certain payments to our Advisor in connection with the disposal of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us.  
  Our principal demand for funds will be to fund value-enhancement and other capital improvement projects at our properties, to pay operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. We intend to generally fund our cash needs for items, other than asset acquisitions, from operations. Otherwise, we expect that our principal sources of working capital will include: 
             
    current cash balances; 
                
    various forms of secured and unsecured financing; 
                
    equity capital from joint venture partners; and 
                
    cash from operations. 
     Over the short term, we believe that our sources of capital, specifically our cash balances, cash flow from operations, our ability to raise equity capital from joint venture partners and our ability to obtain various forms of secured and unsecured financing will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements and capital commitments. 
  Over the longer term, in addition to the sources of capital noted above which we will rely on to meet our short term liquidity requirements, we may also utilize proceeds from the sale of our properties. We may also conduct additional public or private offerings. We expect these resources to be adequate to fund our operating activities, debt service and distributions, which we presently anticipate will grow over time, and will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operating activities as well as providing capital for investment in future development and other joint ventures along with potential forward purchase commitments. 
  On October 22, 2012, we entered into a revolving credit facility with PNC Bank to borrow up to $5,000,000. On April 25, 2013, we amended the credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to $20,000,000. On   July 18, 2014  , we further amended the revolving credit facility, to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity from   $20,000,000   to   $35,000,000  . The amended and restated credit facility consisted of a Tranche A and a Tranche B, and provided certain security for borrowings under the credit facility. The maximum amount that could be borrowed under Tranche A and Tranche B were   $20,000,000   and  
  
    42 

     Table of Contents  
    
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 
  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

$15,000,000  , respectively. The amended and restated credit facility had a maturity date of   July 17, 2016  , subject to extension. On   June 30, 2016  , we repaid all outstanding amounts due and terminated the amended and restated credit facility.  
  On July 29, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement and a multifamily note with PNC Bank that provide for a new credit facility in an amount not to exceed   $350,000,000   to refinance certain of our existing mortgage loans. The credit facility has a maturity date of   August 1, 2021  , subject to extension. Advances made under the credit facility will be secured by the properties set out in Note 5 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We continue to evaluate possible sources of capital, including, without limitation, entering into additional credit facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financings on favorable terms, if at all.   
  Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   65   multifamily properties. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $38,303,678   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $36,702,062   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to improved operations at our portfolio of properties, partially offset by increased interest payments and certain costs paid in connection with the Refinancing Transactions. Additionally, cash flows provided by operating activities varied due to timing of payments of operating expenses during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the prior period. 
  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net cash used in investing activities was   $49,944,075   compared to net cash used in investing activities of   $23,360,538   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a   $30,000,000   investment in a certificate of deposit during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   consisted of the following: 
               
    $877,228   of cash provided by restricted cash accounts related to replacement reserves; 
       Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by financing activities was   $54,357,435   compared to net cash used in financing activities of   $6,846,381   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in cash flow from financing activities is due primarily to the increase in proceeds from notes payable in connection with the Refinancing Transactions, partially offset by increases to payments of deferred financing costs and redemptions of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   consisted of the following:  
              
    $235,124,750   provided by net borrowings from the credit facilities, primarily in connection with the Refinancing Transactions; 
                
    $3,202,337   of cash paid for debt extinguishment costs in connection with the Refinancing Transactions;

Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
  We have used, and intend to use in the future, secured and unsecured debt. We believe that the careful use of borrowings will help us achieve our diversification goals and potentially enhance the returns on our investments. At the conclusion of our Public Offering, our borrowings were approximately 65% of the cost of our real properties (before deducting depreciation and amortization) plus the value of our other investments. Going forward, we expect that our borrowings will be approximately 65% of the value of our properties, as determined by an independent third party appraiser or qualified independent valuation expert. Under our Charter, we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets, which generally approximates to 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets. We may borrow in excess of this amount if such excess is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next Quarterly Report, along with a justification for such excess. In such event, we will monitor our debt levels and take action to reduce any such excess as practicable. Our aggregate borrowings are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. As of   September 30, 2016  , our aggregate borrowings were not in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. 
  In addition to using our capital resources for investing purposes and meeting our debt obligations, we expect to use our capital resources to make certain payments to our Advisor or its affiliates. We expect to make payments to our Advisor in connection with the selection and origination or purchase of real estate and real estate-related investments, the management of our assets, the management of the development or improvement of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had indebtedness totaling an aggregate principal amount of   $1,219,503,264  , including the net premiums on certain notes payable of   $2,517,258   and the net deferred financing costs of   $9,332,831  . The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  : 

_____________________________ 
            (2) 
    Projected principal payments on outstanding debt obligations are based on the terms of the notes payable agreements. Amounts exclude the amortization of the debt premiums and discounts in addition to net deferred financing costs associated with certain notes payable.

Results of Operations 
  Overview 
  The discussion that follows is based on our consolidated results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The ability to compare one period to another is significantly affected by our value-enhancement strategy and the construction of additional apartment homes. Although the number of multifamily properties owned as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015   remained unchanged at   65  , our results of operations were impacted by the construction of an additional 96 apartment homes at one existing multifamily property during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the construction of an additional 86 apartment homes at another existing multifamily property after   September 30, 2015   and our value-enhancement activity completed through   September 30, 2016  , as further discussed below. 
  Our results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not indicative of those expected in future periods. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we continue the process of value-enhancement projects, which may have a significant impact on our future results of operations. In general, we expect that our income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future periods as a result of organic rent increases, anticipated value-enhancement projects and construction of additional apartment homes. 
  To provide additional insight into our operating results, we are also providing a detailed analysis of same-store versus non-same-store net operating income ( NOI ). For more information on NOI and a reconciliation of NOI (a non-GAAP financial measure) to net loss, see   Net Operating Income.  
  Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015 
  The following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

________________ 
           (1) 
    NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings. However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of our properties and  
     
    45 

     Table of Contents  
    
  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 
  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs, all of which are significant economic costs.  For additional information on how we calculate NOI and a reconciliation of NOI to net loss, see   Net Operating Income.  
           (2) 
    GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), established the measurement tool of FFO. Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among REITs. Additionally, we use modified funds from operations ( MFFO ), as defined by the Investment Program Association (the  IPA ) as a supplemental measure to evaluate our operating performance. MFFO is based on FFO but includes certain adjustments we believe are necessary due to changes in accounting and reporting under GAAP since the establishment of FFO. Neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as alternatives to net loss or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of our operating performance, nor should they be considered as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or other measurements under GAAP as indicators of liquidity. For additional information on how we calculate FFO and MFFO and a reconciliation of FFO and MFFO to net loss, see   Funds From Operations and Modified Funds From Operations.  
     Net loss 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had a net loss of   $9,699,187   compared to a net loss of   $3,603,728   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in net loss of   $6,095,459   over the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the   increase   in operating, maintenance and management expenses of   $926,406  , the   increase   in real estate taxes and insurance of   $456,541  , the   increase   in fees to affiliates of   $1,402,420  , the   increase   in depreciation and amortization expense of   $1,063,555  , the   increase   in interest expense of   $500,693  , the   increase   in loss on debt extinguishment of   $3,743,325   and the   increase   in general and administrative expenses of   $1,208,023  , partially offset by the   increase   in total revenues of   $3,205,504  . Our operations were primarily negatively impacted by the costs incurred in connection with the Third Quarter Refinancing Transactions. 
  Total revenues 
  Rental income and tenant reimbursements for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $56,371,925   compared to   $53,166,421   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $3,205,504   was primarily due to the average monthly rent for our property portfolio increasing from   $998   at   September 30, 2015   to   $1,027   at   September 30, 2016   primarily attributable to ordinary monthly rent increases and the completion of value-enhancement projects, as well as non-recurring insurance claim recoveries recognized during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, total units increased by   87   from   16,622   at   September 30, 2015   to   16,709   at   September 30, 2016  . We expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to increase in future periods as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases and our value-enhancement strategy. 
  Operating, maintenance and management expense 
  Operating, maintenance and management expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $15,607,923   compared to   $14,681,517   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $926,406   was primarily due to higher costs incurred for utilities and repairs and maintenance during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . We expect that these amounts will decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we implement operational efficiencies at our multifamily properties.

  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Real estate taxes and insurance 
  Real estate taxes and insurance expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $8,980,995   compared to   $8,524,454   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $456,541   was due primarily to increased assessed values of our property portfolio resulting in higher property taxes at certain of our properties. These amounts may increase in future periods as a result of municipal property tax rate increases and/or increases in the assessed value of our property portfolio. 
  Fees to affiliates 
  Fees to affiliates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $7,062,486   compared to   $5,660,066   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $1,402,420   was primarily due to the   $1,493,727   in refinancing fees incurred in connection with the Third Quarter Refinancing Transactions during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to no refinancing fees incurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . We expect fees to affiliates to decrease in future periods as a result of the decrease in anticipated future refinancing activity. 
  Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $17,559,941   compared to   $16,496,386   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $1,063,555   was primarily due to the net increase in depreciable and amortizable assets of   $28,391,751   since   September 30, 2015  . We expect these amounts to increase slightly in future periods as a result of anticipated future enhancements to our real estate portfolio. 
  Interest expense 
  Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $10,520,206   compared to   $10,019,513   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $500,693   was primarily due to a net increase of   $100,562,297   in our total notes payable balance from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing and the opportunity to sell real estate properties and real estate-related investments. 
  Loss on debt extinguishment 
  Loss on debt extinguishment for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $3,743,325   compared to   $0   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . These expenses consisted of prepayment penalties and the expense of the deferred financing costs, net related to the repayment and extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of certain notes payable during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . The loss on debt extinguishment will vary in future periods if we repay the remaining outstanding principal prior to the scheduled maturity dates of the notes payable. 
  General and administrative expense 
  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $2,596,236   compared to   $1,388,213   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . These general and administrative costs consisted primarily of legal fees, insurance premiums, audit fees, other professional fees, independent director compensation and certain state taxes. The   increase   of   $1,208,023   was primarily due to costs incurred related to the refinancing of certain mortgage notes payable during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Similar activity did not occur during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues.

Consolidated Results of Operations for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015

     Net loss 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we had a net loss of   $21,356,546   compared to a net loss of   $10,338,802   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in net loss of   $11,017,744   over the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the   increase   in operating, maintenance and management expenses of   $2,945,516  , the   increase   in real estate taxes and insurance of   $630,518  , the   increase   in fees to affiliates of   $3,505,697  , the   increase   in depreciation and amortization expense of   $2,891,273  , the   increase   in interest expense of   $1,180,413  , the   increase   in loss on debt extinguishment of   $4,932,369   and the   increase   in general and administrative expenses of   $1,779,038  , partially offset by the   increase   in total revenues of   $6,839,935   and the   decrease   in acquisition costs of   $7,145  . Our operations were primarily negatively impacted by the costs incurred in connection with the Refinancing Transactions. 
  Total revenues 
  Rental income and tenant reimbursements for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $163,301,458   compared to   $156,461,523   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $6,839,935   was primarily due to the average monthly rent for our property portfolio increasing from   $998   at   September 30, 2015   to   $1,027   at   September 30, 2016   primarily attributable to ordinary monthly rent increases and the completion of value-enhancement projects, as well as non-recurring insurance claim recoveries recognized during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, our total units increase

d by   87   from   16,622   at   September 30, 2015   to   16,709   at   September 30, 2016  . We expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to increase in future periods as a result of ordinary monthly rent increases and our value-enhancement strategy. 
  Operating, maintenance and management expense 
  Operating, maintenance and management expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $43,220,781   compared to   $40,275,265   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $2,945,516   was primarily due to higher costs incurred for utilities, repairs and maintenance and property operating costs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . We expect that these amounts will decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we implement operational efficiencies at our multifamily properties. 
  Real estate taxes and insurance 
  Real estate taxes and insurance expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $27,940,715   compared to   $27,310,197   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $630,518   was due primarily to increased assessed values of our property portfolio resulting in higher property taxes at certain of our properties. We expect these amounts may increase in future periods as a result of municipal property tax increases as well as increases in the assessed value of our property portfolio. 
  Fees to affiliates 
  Fees to affiliates for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $19,947,606   compared to   $16,441,909   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This   increase   of   $3,505,697   was primarily due to the   $3,283,737   in refinancing fees incurred in connection with the Refinancing Transactions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to no refinancing fees incurred during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Additionally, investment management fees and property management fees increased from the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . We expect fees to affiliates to decrease in future periods as a result of the decrease in anticipated future refinancing activity. 
  Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $51,723,985   compared to   $48,832,712   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $2,891,273   was primarily due to the net increase in depreciable and amortizable assets of   $28,391,751   since   September 30, 2015  . We expect these amounts to increase slightly in future periods as a result of anticipated future enhancements to our real estate portfolio. 
  Interest expense 
  Interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $30,707,522   compared to   $29,527,109   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   of   $1,180,413   was primarily due to a net increase of   $100,562,297   in our total notes payable balance from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing and the opportunity to sell real estate properties and real estate-related investments. 
  Loss on debt extinguishment 
  Loss on debt extinguishment for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $4,932,369   compared to   $0   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . These expenses consisted of prepayment penalties and the expense of the deferred financing costs, net related to the repayment and extinguishment of the debt in conjunction with the refinancing of certain mortgage notes payable during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The loss on debt extinguishment will vary in future periods if we repay the remaining outstanding principal prior to the scheduled maturity dates of the mortgage notes payable.

General and administrative expense 
  General and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $6,185,026   compared to   $4,405,988   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . These general and administrative costs consisted primarily of legal fees, insurance premiums, audit fees, other professional fees, independent director compensation and certain state taxes. The   increase   of   $1,779,038   was primarily due to costs incurred related to the refinancing of certain mortgage notes payable during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues. 
  Acquisition costs 
  Acquisition costs for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $0   compared to   $7,145   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The acquisition costs were consistent, with no meaningful changes from the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . We do not expect to incur significant acquisition costs in the future as we have invested all proceeds from our Public Offering. 
  Property Operations for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  For purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance, we categorize our properties as  same-store  or  non-same-store.  A  same-store  property is a property that was owned at July 1, 2015. A  non-same-store  property is a property that was acquired, placed into service or disposed of after July 1, 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   65   properties were categorized as same-store properties. 
  The following table presents the same-store and non-same-store results from operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

    See   Net Operating Income  below for a reconciliation of NOI to net loss. 
     Net Operating Income 
  Same-store net operating income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $28,234,520   compared to   $27,961,843   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   1%     increase   in same-store net operating income was primarily due to a   3%     increase   in same-store rental revenues offset by a   6%     increase   in same-store operating expenses over the comparable prior year period.

Revenues 
  Same-store revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $54,866,867   compared to   $53,166,421   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   3%     increase   in same-store revenues was primarily due to the average rent increases at the same-store properties from   $998   as of   September 30, 2015   to   $1,027   as of   September 30, 2016  , primarily attributable to ordinary monthly rent increases and the completion of value-enhancement projects. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Same-store operating expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $26,632,347   compared to   $25,204,578   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The   6%     increase   in same-store operating expenses was primarily due to increased utilities, repairs and maintenance and real estate taxes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   relative to the comparable prior year period. 
  Net Operating Income 
  NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) non-operating fees to affiliates, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (5) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to us. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income (loss) because it is specific to our particular financing capabilities and constraints. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Acquisition costs and non-operating fees to affiliates are eliminated because they do not reflect continuing operating costs of the property owner. 
  Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our multifamily properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
  The usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, acquisition costs, certain fees to affiliates, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness. 
  NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  regarding the components of net income (loss) that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do.

            (2)

     Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, or FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.  
  We define FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the  White Paper ). The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and non-cash impairment charges of real estate related investments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In particular, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time. An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset. Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s policy described above.

The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe that since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. However, FFO, and MFFO as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.  
  Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses. Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start-up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that public, non-listed REITs, like us, are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after acquisition activity ceases. Our board of directors will determine to pursue a liquidity event when it believes that the then-current market conditions are favorable. Thus, as a limited life REIT, we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life.  
  Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA, an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a public, non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.

  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

We define MFFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01,   Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations   (the  Practice Guideline ), issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. While we rely on our Advisor for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do not retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such non-recurring gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of on-going operations.  
  Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA s Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income. These expenses are paid in cash by us. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. In the event that operational earnings and cash flow are not available to fund our reimbursement of acquisition fees and expenses incurred by our Advisor, such fees and expenses will need to be reimbursed to our Advisor from other sources, including debt, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows. The acquisition of properties, and the corresponding acquisition fees and expenses, is the key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flow to fund distributions to our stockholders. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities. In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.  
  Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate MFFO in order to evaluate our performance against other public, non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate MFFO allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to public, non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.

Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance to that of other public, non-listed REITs, although it should be noted that not all public, non-listed REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other public, non-listed REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. MFFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining MFFO.  
  Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly. 
  Our calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

________________ 
           (1) 
    By excluding acquisition fees and expenses, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our Advisor or third parties. Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to the property. In the event that operational earnings and cash flows are not available to fund our reimbursement of acquisition fees and expenses incurred by our Advisor, such fees and expenses will need to be reimbursed to the Advisor from other sources, including debt, net proceeds from the sale of properties, or from ancillary cash flows.

respectively, that are recorded in fees to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition fees and expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   also include acquisition expenses of   $0   and   $0   and acquisition expenses of   $0   and   $7,145   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, that are recorded in acquisition costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
  FFO and MFFO may be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO and MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
  Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
  We have entered into agreements with our Advisor and its affiliates whereby we have paid, and may continue to pay, certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, our Advisor or its affiliates for acquisition and advisory fees and expenses, financing coordination fees, organization and offering costs, asset and property management fees and expenses, leasing fees and reimbursement of certain operating costs. Refer to Note 8 to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund the acquisition, expansion and refinancing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. We may be also exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates as a result of the acquisition and origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans. Our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We have managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level. In addition, we have, and may in the future, utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate caps, floors and swap agreements, in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations. When we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, we may be subject to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments. 
  We borrow funds and make investments at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our fixed rate debt was   $483,868,305   and the carrying value of our fixed rate debt was   $473,819,459  . The fair value estimate of our fixed rate debt was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity if the loans were originated at   September 30, 2016  . As we expect to hold our fixed rate instruments to maturity and the amounts due under such instruments would be limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting change in fair value of our fixed rate instruments, would have a significant impact on our operations.

  PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued) 

Conversely, movements in interest rates on our variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of floating rate instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our variable rate debt was   $742,553,362   and the carrying value of our variable rate debt was   $745,683,805  . Based on interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , if interest rates were 100 basis points higher during the 12 months ending   September 30, 2017  , interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by   $7,705,406   and if interest rates were 100 basis points lower during the 12 months ending   September 30, 2017  , interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease by   $4,055,430  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average interest rate of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt was   4.07%   and   2.68%  , respectively. The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect at   September 30, 2016   (consisting of the contractual interest rate), using interest rate indices as of   September 30, 2016   where applicable. 
  We will also be exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of a derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We will seek to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have counterparty risk on our interest rate cap agreements as the underlying variable rates for each of our interest rate cap agreements as of   September 30, 2016   were not in excess of the capped rates. See also Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.  
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon and as of the date of the evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ending   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    I have reviewed this   quarterly   report on Form 10-  Q   of Steadfast Income REIT, Inc.;

              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
