        N  OTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Clifton Bancorp Inc. (the  Company ), the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Clifton Savings Bank (the  Bank ), and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, Botany Inc. ( Botany ). The Company s principal business is the ownership and operation of the Bank.  Botany s business consists solely of holding investment and mortgage-backed securities, and Botany is treated under New Jersey tax law as a New Jersey Investment Company. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X and do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other period. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended March 31, 2016, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 8, 2016. 
 The Company has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the statement of financial condition date of September 30, 2016 for items that should potentially be recognized or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements. The evaluation was conducted through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. 
  2. EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)  
 Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares actually outstanding, and is adjusted for employee stock ownership plan shares not yet committed to be released and deferred compensation obligations required to be settled in shares of Company stock. Unvested restricted stock awards, which contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends, are considered participating securities and the two-class method of computing basic and diluted EPS is applied. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as outstanding stock options, were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding to include the effect of contracts or securities exercisable (such as stock options) or which could be converted into common stock, if dilutive, using the treasury stock method. Basic and diluted EPS have been determined based on the adjusted numbers of weighted average shares. The calculation of diluted EPS for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 includes incremental shares related to outstanding stock options of 60,310 and 60,073, respectively.  The calculation of diluted EPS for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015 includes incremental shares related to outstanding stock options of 54,038 and 64,304, respectively. Shares issued or retired during any period are weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2016,  the average number of options which were antidilutive were 1,035,635 and 1,046,640, respectively.  During the three and six months ended September 30, 2015,  the average number of options which were antidilutive were 360,564 and 186,752, respectively. 
  3. STOCK REPURCHASE AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  
 On March 11, 2015, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan, that became effective on April 2, 2015, to acquire up to 2,731,000 shares, or 10%, of the Company s outstanding common stock. On October 28, 2015, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an extension of the stock repurchase plan to acquire an additional 2,569,000 shares, or 10%, of the Company s outstanding common stock. On September 8, 2016 the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an extension of the stock repurchase plan to acquire up to an additional 1,155,000 shares, or 5%, of the Company s outstanding common stock.  
 During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 888,900 and 2,270,000 shares were repurchased, respectively, under the repurchase plan at an aggregate cost of approximately $13.3 million, or $14.93 per share, and $31.3 million, or $13.81 per share, respectively.

3. STOCK REPURCHASE AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION (CONT D)  
   
 At the Company s annual meeting of stockholders held on August 6, 2015, stockholders of the Company approved the Clifton Bancorp Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ( the Plan ). Under the Plan, the Company may grant options to purchase up to 1,705,944 shares of Company common stock and may grant up to 682,377 shares of Company common stock as restricted stock awards.  
 On September 2, 2015, 511,784 shares of restricted stock were awarded, with a grant date fair value of $13.84 per share. To fund the grants of restricted common stock, the Company issued 511,784 shares from authorized shares. All shares of restricted stock granted on this date vest in equal installments over a five-year period beginning one year from the date of grant.  
 On April 6, 2016, 8,000 shares of restricted stock were awarded, with a grant date fair value of $14.89 per share. To fund the grants of restricted common stock, the Company issued 8,000 shares from authorized shares. All shares of restricted stock granted on this date vest one year from the date of grant. 
 On August 31, 2016, effective on September 12, 2016, 9,000 shares of restricted stock were awarded, with a grant date fair value of $15.16 per share. To fund the grants of restricted common stock, the Company issued 9,000 shares from authorized shares. All shares of restricted stock granted on this date vest in equal installments over a three-year period beginning one year from the date of grant. 
 Management recognizes expense for the fair value of these awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $683,000 and $129,000, respectively, in expense was recognized in regard to these restricted stock awards. The Company recognized approximately $279,000 and $53,000 of income tax benefits resulting from this expense for six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The expected future compensation expense relating to the 400,532 non-vested restricted shares outstanding at September 30, 2016 is $5.4 million over a weighted average period of 3.8 years.  
 The following is summary of the status of the Company s non-vested restricted shares: 

Under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, on September 2, 2015, stock options to purchase 1,108,868 shares of Company common stock were awarded, with a grant date fair value of $1.63 per share and an expiration date of September 2, 2025. All of these stock options granted vest in equal installments over a five-year period beginning one year from the date of grant. Stock options were granted at an exercise price of $13.84 equal to the fair value of the Company s common stock on the grant date based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the stock options of $1.63 was estimated utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: an expected life of 6.5 years, risk-free rate of return of 1.92%, volatility of 12.50% and a dividend yield of 1.73%.  
   
 Under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, on April 6, 2016, stock options to purchase 10,000 shares of Company common stock were awarded, with a grant date fair value of $1.79 per share and an expiration date of April 6, 2026. All of these stock options granted vest one year from the date of grant. Stock options were granted at an exercise price of $14.89 equal to the fair value of the Company s common stock on the grant date based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the stock options was estimated utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: an expected life of 5.5 years, risk-free rate of return of 1.28%, volatility of 14.92% and a dividend yield of 1.61%.

3. STOCK REPURCHASE AND   STOCK BASED COMPENSATION (CONT D)  
   
 Under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, effective on September 12, 2016, stock options to purchase 10,000 shares of Company common stock were awarded, with a grant date fair value of $1.92 per share and an expiration date of September 12, 2026. All of these stock options granted vest one year from the date of grant. Stock options were granted at an exercise price of $15.16 equal to the fair value of the Company s common stock on the grant date based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the stock options was estimated utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: an expected life of 5.5 years, risk-free rate of return of 1.28%, volatility of 15.63% and a dividend yield of 1.58%.  
 The expected option life was estimated as the mid-point between the vesting period and ten year life of the options. The risk-free rate of return was based on the rate on the grant date of a U.S. Treasury Note with a term equal to the expected option life. Expected volatility was based on the historical stock price activity of the Company over the year prior to the grant date. The dividend rate was based on the cash dividends paid by the Company over the year prior to the grant date on its common stock. 
   
 Management recognizes expense for the fair value of these awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period. During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $166,000 and $35,000, respectively, in stock option expense was recorded net of income tax benefits of $47,000 and $10,000 respectively. The expected future compensation expense relating to the 847,676 non-vested options outstanding at September 30, 2016 is $1.3 million over the weighted average period of 3.8 years.

 Contractual maturity data for securities are as follows: 

The amortized cost and carrying values shown above are by contractual final maturity.  Actual maturities will differ from contractual final maturities due to scheduled monthly payments related to mortgage-backed securities and due to the borrowers having the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. The Company s mortgage-backed securities are generally secured by residential mortgage loans with contractual maturities of 15 years or greater, and multi-family loans with maturities of five to 10 years. However, the effective lives of those securities are generally shorter than their contractual maturities due to principal amortization and prepayment of the loans within those securities. Investors in pass-through securities generally share in the receipt of principal repayments on a pro-rata basis as paid by the borrowers.

5. SECURITIES (CONT D)  
 The age of gross unrealized losses and the fair value of related securities at September 30 and March 31, 2016 were as follows: 

Management does not believe that any of the unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 (one corporate bond and two municipal bonds included in debt securities, and five FNMA mortgage-backed securities and two GNMA mortgage-backed securities) represent an other-than-temporary impairment as they are primarily related to market interest rates and not related to the underlying credit quality of the issuers of the securities.  Additionally, the Company and its subsidiaries have the ability, and management has the intent, to hold such securities for the time necessary to recover amortized cost and does not have the intent to sell the securities, and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost. 
   
 During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the proceeds from sales of securities available for sale totaled $3.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, resulting in gross realized gains of $84,000 and $72,000, respectively.

6. LOANS RECEIVABLE AND AL  LOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES  
 The following is a summary of loans by segment and the classes within those segments: 

The allowance for loan losses consists of general and unallocated components. For loans that are classified as impaired, a valuation allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component of the allowance covers pools of loans by loan class not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as one- to four-family real estate, construction real estate, second mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and passbook loans.  These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors to reflect current conditions. The qualitative risk factors include: 

1.   
 
 Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices.    

2.   
 
 National, regional, and local economic and business conditions, including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans.    

3.   
 
 Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans.    

4.   
 
 Experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff.     

5.   
 
 The quality of the Bank s loan review system.    

6.   
 
 Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans.    

7.   
 
 Existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations.    

8.   
 
 Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.

6. LOANS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (CONT D)  
 Each factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management s best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation. 
 An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating losses in the portfolio. 
 The evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on an analysis which categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics. The loan portfolio segments are further disaggregated into the following loan classes, where the risk level for each type is analyzed when determining the allowance for loan losses. 
 Real Estate: 
 1. One- to Four-Family Loans - consists of loans secured by first liens on either owner occupied or investment properties.  These loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of the underlying properties. The risk is considered relatively low as the Bank has always had conservative underwriting standards and does not have sub-prime loans in its loan portfolio.  
 2. Multi-Family Loans - consists of loans secured by multi-family real estate which generally involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. These loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of the underlying properties.  
 3. Commercial Loans - consists of loans secured by commercial real estate which generally involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. These loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of the underlying properties. These loans are affected by economic conditions to a greater degree than one- to four-family and multi-family loans. 
 4. Construction Loans - consists primarily of the financing of construction of one- to four-family properties or construction/permanent loans for the construction of one- to four-family homes to be occupied by the borrower. Construction loans generally are considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate due to uncertainty of construction costs. Independent inspections are performed prior to disbursement of loan proceeds as construction progresses to mitigate these risks. These loans are also affected by economic conditions. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans: 
 Consists of commercial lines of credit and term loans which can be either secured or unsecured. Commercial and industrial loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss due to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and/or borrowers and the effects of general economic conditions on the business and/or the value of the underlying properties, if applicable. Commercial and industrial loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than other forms of lending.  
 Consumer: 
 1. Second Mortgage and Equity Lines of Credit - consists of one- to four-family loans secured by first, second or third liens (when the Bank has the two other lien positions). These loans are affected by the borrower s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. The credit risk is considered slightly higher than one- to four-family first lien loans as these loans are also dependent on the value of underlying properties, but in many instances, have the added risk of a subordinate collateral position. 
 2. Passbook or Certificate and Other Loans - consists of loans secured by passbook accounts and certificates of deposits and unsecured loans. The passbook or certificate loans have low credit risk as they are fully secured by their collateral. Unsecured loans, included in other loans, are two loans in a New Jersey loan fund and they also are considered a low credit risk.

6. LOANS RECEIVABLE AND ALLO  WANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (CONT D)  
 The allowance calculation methodology includes further segregation of loan classes into risk rating categories. The borrower s overall financial condition, repayment sources, guarantors and value of collateral, if appropriate, are evaluated when credit deficiencies arise, such as delinquent loan payments. Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss.  Loans classified as special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If uncorrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects.  Loans classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable. Loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Non-classified assets are rated as a pass or pass-watch. Pass-watch loans require current oversight or tracking by management generally due to incomplete documentation or monitoring due to previous delinquent status. 
 In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the  OCC ), as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews the Bank s loan portfolio and the related allowance for loan losses. The OCC may require the allowance for loan losses to be increased based on its review of information available at the time of the examination. 
 The change in the allowance for loan losses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:

6. LOANS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES (CONT D)  
 The aggregate amount of classified loan balances are as follows at September 30 and March 31, 2016: 

The following table provides information with respect to the Bank s nonaccrual loans at September 30 and March 31, 2016. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become more than 90 days delinquent, or when the collection of principal and/or interest become doubtful. Nonaccrual loans differed from the amount of total loans past due greater than 90 days due to some previously delinquent loans that are currently not more than 90 days delinquent which are maintained on nonaccrual status for a minimum of six months until the borrower has demonstrated the ability to satisfy the loan terms. A loan is returned to accrual status when there is sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months) by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan, or in some circumstances, when the factors indicating doubtful collectability no longer exist and the Bank expects repayment of the remaining contractual amounts due.

 The following table provides information about delinquencies in the Bank s loan portfolio at September 30 and March 31, 2016. 

There were no loans that are past due greater than 90 days that were accruing as of September 30 and March 31, 2016. 
 We may obtain physical possession of real estate collateralizing a residential mortgage loan via foreclosure on an in-substance repossession. As of September 30, 2016, we hold four foreclosed residential real estate properties with a carrying value of $943,000 as a result of obtaining physical possession. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, we have six residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of $705,000 collateralized by residential real estate property for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process. 
 A loan is defined as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company considers one- to four-family mortgage loans and consumer installment loans to be homogeneous and, therefore, does not generally evaluate them individually for impairment, unless they are considered troubled debt restructurings.  All other loans are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis.

The recorded investment in loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring totaled $1.4 million and $994,000, respectively, at September 30 and March 31, 2016, of which $194,000 and $0, respectively, were 90 days or more past due, $17,000 and $0, respectively, were 60 to 89 days past due, and $55,000 and $213,000, respectively, were 30 to 59 days past due. The remaining loans modified were current at the time of the restructuring and have complied with the terms of their restructure agreements at September 30 and March 31, 2016. Loans that were modified in a troubled debt restructuring represent concessions made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The Bank works with these borrowers to modify existing loan terms usually by extending maturities or reducing interest rates. The Bank records an impairment loss, if any, based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan s effective interest rate. Subsequently, these loans are individually evaluated for impairment.

  7. FAIR VALUE  
 Accounting guidance on fair value measurement establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
 In addition, the guidance requires the Company to disclose the fair value for certain assets and liabilities on both a recurring and non-recurring basis. 
 An asset s or liability s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

7. FAIR VALUE (CONT D)  
 The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Company s assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of certain of the Company s assets and liabilities at September 30 and March 31, 2016: 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents, Interest Receivable, and Interest Payable (Carried at Cost) 
 The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition for cash and cash equivalents, interest receivable, and interest payable approximate their fair values. 
 Securities 
 The fair value of all securities, whether classified as available for sale (carried at fair value) or held to maturity (carried at cost), is determined by reference to quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. Securities are measured on a recurring basis. The fair values of these securities are obtained from quotes received from an independent broker. The Company s broker provides it with prices which are categorized as Level 2 since quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are generally not available. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs monthly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source. The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by third-party pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. 
 Loans Receivable (Carried at Cost) 
 Fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows, using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, of such loans. 
 Impaired Loans (Carried based on Collateral Fair Value or Discounted Cash Flows) 
 Impaired loans are those accounted for under ASC Topic 310  Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan  in which the Company has measured impairment generally based on either the fair value of the loan s collateral or discounted cash flows. These assets are included as Level 3 assets. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock (Carried at Cost) 
 Fair value approximates cost basis as these instruments are redeemable only with the issuing agency at face value. 
 Deposits (Carried at Cost) 
 The fair value of non-interest-bearing demand, interest-bearing demand, and Savings and Club accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. For fixed-maturity certificates of deposit, fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
 Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (Carried at Cost) 
 The fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently offered for liabilities of similar remaining maturities, or when available, quoted market prices.

 CLIFTON BANCORP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

7. FAIR VALUE (CONT D)  
 Commitments to Extend Credit 
 The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. 
 As of September 30 and March 31, 2016, the fair value of the commitments to extend credit were not considered to be material. 
 The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

8.   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
 On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) and International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) issued their final standard on revenue from contracts with customers. The standard, issued as ASU 2014-09 by the FASB and as IFRS 152 by the IASB, and amended by ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The goals of the revenue recognition project are to clarify and converge the revenue recognition principles under U.S. GAAP and IFRS and to develop guidance that would streamline and enhance revenue recognition requirements while also providing  a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues.  The boards believe that the standard will improve the consistency of requirements, comparability of revenue recognition practices, and usefulness of disclosures. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this standard effective April 1, 2018 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The ASU significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this standard effective April 1, 2018 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 includes a lessee accounting model that recognizes two types of leases - finance leases and operating leases. The standard requires that a lessee recognize on the balance sheet assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.  New disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases are also required. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. For a public entity, the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the standard s impact, and the adoption of this standard, effective April 1, 2019, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. The amendment simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the following: Accounting for income taxes; Classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flow; Forfeitures; Statutory tax withholding requirements; Classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; Classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. The ASU is aimed at reducing the cost and complexity of accounting for share-based payments, that will likely result in significant changes to net income and earnings per share, including the effect of the exclusion of windfall tax benefits from the hypothetical proceeds used to calculate the repurchase of shares under the treasury stock method. For a public entity, the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption will be permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company has adopted the standard effective April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis. Prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. The new guidance introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. The ASU also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the ALLL. In addition, public business entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. For a public entity, the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. While the standard s ultimate impact on the Company s financial statements remains unknown today, we are preparing to implement this standard on April 1, 2020.

 On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), a consensus of the FASB s Emerging Issues Task Force. The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance  addresses eight classification issues related to the statement of cash flows, which include proceeds from settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies and bank-owned life insurance policies. For a public entity,  ASU 2016-15 is effective annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this standard effective April 1, 2018 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

 This Form 10-Q may include, and from time to time the Company may disclose, certain forward-looking statements based on current management expectations. The Company s actual results could differ materially from those management expectations.  Factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, changes in tax policies, rates and regulations of federal, state and local tax authorities, changes in interest rates, deposit flows, the cost of funds, demand for loan products, and for financial services, competition, changes in the quality or composition of loan and investment portfolios, changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, and other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors affecting the Company s operations, markets, products, services and prices. (See Part II -  Item 1A: Risk Factors. ) Additional factors are discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016 under Part I -  Item 1A. Risk Factors .  These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date of the forward-looking statements or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Accordingly, past results and trends should not be used by investors to anticipate future results or trends. 
 Overview of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The Company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income, which is a function of the interest rate environment.  Net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. It is a function of the average balances of loans and securities versus deposits and borrowed funds outstanding in any one period and the yields earned on those loans and securities and the costs of those deposits and borrowed funds. 
 Interest-earning assets consist primarily of investment and mortgage-backed securities and net loans, which comprised 24.2% and 67.2%, respectively, of total assets at September 30, 2016, as compared to 28.5% and 62.3%, respectively, of total assets at March 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to 1.7% of total assets at September 30, 2016, as compared to 2.5% at March 31, 2016. The Company s mortgage-backed securities portfolio at September 30, 2016 consists solely of U.S. government-sponsored or guaranteed enterprises and the investment portfolio consists of approximately 48% U.S. government-sponsored or guaranteed enterprises, 38% corporate bonds and 14% municipal bonds. 
 Interest-bearing liabilities consist of deposits, and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the  FHLB ).  Deposits increased $77.6 million, or 11.2%, between March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016. Borrowed funds decreased $7.0 million, or 3.0% as new borrowings of $175.0 million were partially offset by repaid borrowings of $182.0 million. The balance at September 30, 2016 was $224.5 million, down from $231.5 million at March 31, 2016. 
 Net interest income increased $529,000, or 8.1%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared with the same 2015 period. The increase in net interest income was mostly due to a $1.2 million increase in total interest income, partially offset by a $648,000 increase in total interest expense. Average interest-earning assets increased $133.5 million, or 12.4%, compared with the same 2015 period, while average interest-bearing liabilities increased $171.5 million, or 21.9%, when compared with the same 2015 period. The $38.0 million decrease in average net interest-earning assets was mainly attributable to decreases of $5.8 million in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities, and $57.3 million in the average balance of investment securities, coupled with an increase of $109.6 million in the average balance of FHLB advances and $61.8 million in average interest bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase of $189.4 million in the average balance of loans, and $7.1 million in average other interest-earning assets. 
 The net interest rate spread decreased to 2.08% from 2.12% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared with the same 2015 period. The increase of 3 basis points in the yield on interest-earning assets was more than offset by the increase of 7 basis points in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Results of operations also depend, to a lesser extent, on non-interest income generated, any provision for loan losses recorded, and non-interest expenses incurred. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income increased $49,000, or 10.8%, as compared to the comparable period in 2015. Provision for loan losses increased $405,000, or 405.0%, and non-interest expenses increased $731,000, or 16.0%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
    Changes in Financial Condition  
 Assets at September 30, 2016 totaled $1.31 billion, which represents an increase of $59.1 million, or 4.7%, as compared with $1.25 billion at March 31, 2016. The increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase of $101.4 million in net loans.  
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased $8.3 million, or 26.8%, to $22.8 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $31.1 million at March 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were redeployed into higher yielding assets. 
 Securities available for sale at September 30, 2016 decreased $4.5 million, or 47.0%, to $5.1 million from $9.6 million at March 31, 2016, resulting primarily from principal repayments of $794,000, $3.7 million in proceeds from the sale of a security, and a decrease of $73,000 in the unrealized gain on the portfolio. 
 Securities held to maturity at September 30, 2016 decreased $35.8 million, or 10.3%, to $312.1 million from $347.9 million at March 31, 2016, resulting primarily from maturities, calls and repayments totaling $58.7 million, partially offset by purchases of securities totaling $23.1 million. 
 Net loans at September 30, 2016 increased $101.4 million, or 13.0%, to $881.6 million when compared with $780.2 million at March 31, 2016.  The increase in the loan portfolio was mainly in multi-family and commercial loans which increased $94.1 million, or 61.3%, due to the Bank s continued emphasis on the growth of its loan portfolio. Repayment levels remained relatively stable during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Total liabilities increased $71.5 million, or 7.6%, to $1.01 billion at September 30, 2016 from $937.9 million at March 31, 2016.  Deposits at September 30, 2016 increased $77.6 million, or 11.2%, to $772.3 million when compared with $694.7 million at March 31, 2016. From March 31, 2016 to September 30, 2016, borrowed funds decreased $7.0 million, to $224.5 million, with an outstanding weighted average interest rate of 1.63% at September 30, 2016, compared to 1.53% at March 31, 2016. 
 Total stockholders  equity decreased $12.4 million, or 3.9%, to $302.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $315.3 million at March 31, 2016. The decrease resulted primarily from cash dividends paid of $2.7 million and repurchases of common stock of $13.3 million, partially offset by net income of $2.3 million. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
 Average Balances and Yields.   The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. For purposes of this table, average balances have been calculated using the average of month-end balances, and nonaccrual loans are included in average balances; however, accrued interest income has been excluded from these loans. Loan fees (costs) are included in interest income on loans and are insignificant. Yields are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Any adjustments necessary to present yields on a tax equivalent basis are insignificant.

The decrease during the 2016 period resulted from a decrease of 19 basis points in the yield earned on mortgage-backed securities to 2.59% from 2.78%, coupled with a decrease of $5.8 million, or 2.1%, in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities outstanding. Interest earned on investment securities decreased by $395,000, or 58.3%, to $283,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to $678,000 for the same 2015 period, due to a decrease in the average balance of $57.3 million, or 49.2%, coupled with a decrease of 41 basis point in the yield earned on investment securities to 1.92% from 2.33%. Interest earned on other interest-earning assets increased by $79,000, or 109.7%, to $151,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to $72,000 during the same 2015 period. The increase was due to a 78 basis point increase in the yield to 2.13% from 1.35%, coupled with an increase of $7.1 million, or 33.5%, in the average balance of these assets.  The decrease in the yields on loans, mortgage-backed securities and investment securities was the result of continued overall lower market interest rates, and the maturities of higher yielding investment securities. The yield on other interest-earning assets increased as the balance was mainly comprised of relatively higher yielding FHLB stock. 
 Interest expense on deposits increased $336,000, or 21.2%, to $1.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to $1.6 million during the same 2015 period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $61.8 million, or 9.3%, in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, coupled with a 10 basis points increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits to 1.05% from 0.95%. The increase in balance was the result of the Bank s continued efforts to emphasize deposit taking through business relationships. Interest expense on borrowed money increased approximately $312,000, or 51.0%, to $924,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared with $612,000 during the same 2015 period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $109.6 million, or 94.0%, in the average balance of borrowings, partially offset by a 47 basis point decrease in the cost of borrowings to 1.63% from 2.10%. The $171.4 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was due to an increase of $61.8 million in interest-bearing deposits coupled with an increase of $109.6 million in the average balance of borrowings. Borrowings were used in part to fund loan demand. Net interest income increased $529,000, or 8.1%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, to $7.1 million when compared to $6.5 million for the same 2015 period. The net interest rate spread decreased to 2.08% from 2.12% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared the same 2015 period, due to a 7 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 3 basis point increase in the yield earned on interest-earning assets. 
   
 The provision for loan losses increased $405,000, or 405.0%, to $505,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $100,000 for the same period in 2015. The increase in the provision for the 2016 period was mainly due to the result of the significant increase in the balance of outstanding loans, partially offset by more favorable trends in qualitative factors related to delinquencies considered in the periodic review of the general valuation allowance. The allowance for loan losses is based on management s qualitative analysis, which includes an evaluation of economic and other factors to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss balance. The Bank continually evaluates the need for a provision for loan losses based on its periodic review of the loan portfolio and general market conditions. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank s non-accrual loans totaled $2.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively, representing 0.32% and 0.64%, respectively, of total gross loans, and 0.29% and 0.38%, respectively, of total assets. At March 31, 2016, nonaccrual loans totaled $3.7 million, or 0.47% and 0.29% of total gross loans and total assets, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, $80,000 in net charge-offs were recorded on a one- to four-family residential real estate loan. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, no charge-offs were recorded. At September 30, 2016, non-accrual loans consisted of fourteen loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate and one loan secured by commercial real estate, while at September 30, 2015 non-accrual loans consisted of nineteen loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, one loan secured by commercial real estate, one loan secured by multi-family real estate, one second mortgage loan secured by one- to four-family residential real estate and one second mortgage loan secured by commercial real estate and one construction loan secured by multi-family real estate. Included in non-accrual loans at September 30, 2016 are four loans totaling $568,000 that were current or less than ninety days delinquent. At September 30, 2015, there were seven loans totaling $1.2 million that were current or less than ninety days delinquent included in non-accrual loans. All non-accrual loans included above are secured by properties located in the state of New Jersey. Impaired loans totaled $1.8 million, $1.6 million and $2.1 million at September 30, 2016, March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $5.20 million, $4.36 million, and $3.63 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016, March 31, 2016, and September 30, 2015, representing 0.59%, 0.56%, and 0.53% of total gross loans, respectively.

 Non-interest income increased $49,000, or 10.8%, to $501,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $452,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due to an increase of $45,000, or 90.0%, in fees and service charge on loans and deposits.  
   
 Non-interest expenses increased $731,000, or 16.0%, to $5.31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $4.58 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was driven by increases of $653,000, or 24.0%, in salaries and employee benefits, $83,000, or 23.7%, in occupancy expense of premises, and $68,000, or 18.4%, in equipment expense, partially offset by a decrease of $89,000, or 19.8%, in other expenses. The increase in salaries and employee benefits includes the addition of a chief operating officer, and business development, compliance, lending and Hoboken Banking Center personnel, as well as typical annual increases in compensation and benefits expenses, employee stock ownership plan expense due to an increase in the price of the Company s common stock, and the expense related to the granting of equity awards under the Company s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The increases in occupancy and equipment expenses were mainly related to the costs of the newly opened Hoboken Banking Center, along with the costs associated with new customer products and services. Other expenses decreased mainly due to decreases in consulting and personnel search costs. 
 Income taxes totaled $513,000 and $772,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $259,000, or 33.6%, resulted from lower pre-tax income, coupled with a decrease in the effective income tax rate. The overall effective income tax rate was 29.3% for the 2016 period compared with 33.4% for the 2015 period. The reduced effective tax rate is attributable to the increased investment in bank owned life insurance and the tax benefit resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which amends the treatment for accounting for income taxes on certain employee share-based payment transactions.

 Interest income on loans increased by $2.9 million, or 24.0%, to $15.0 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016, when compared with $12.1 million for the same 2015 period.  The increase during the 2016 period mainly resulted from an increase of $171.8 million, or 26.2%, in the average balance of loans when compared to the same period in 2015, partially offset by a decrease of 7 basis points in the yield earned on the loan portfolio to 3.61% from 3.68%. Interest income on mortgage-backed securities decreased $264,000, or 6.9%, to $3.6 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016, when compared with $3.8 million for the same 2015 period. The decrease during the 2016 period resulted from a decrease of 14 basis points in the yield earned on mortgage-backed securities to 2.64% from 2.78%, coupled with a decrease of $5.5 million, or 2.0%, in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities outstanding. Interest earned on investment securities decreased by $696,000, or 50.2%, to $691,000 during the six months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to $1.4 million during the same 2015 period, due to a decrease of 15 basis point in yield to 2.11% from 2.26%, coupled with a decrease of $57.5 million, or 46.8%, in the average balance of investment securities.  Interest earned on other interest-earning assets   increased by $124,000, or 83.2% to $273,000 during the six months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to $149,000 during the same 2015 period primarily due to an increase of $593,000, or 2.1%, in the average balance of loans, coupled with an increase of 83 basis points in yield to 1.86% from 1.03%.  The increase in the balance of loans resulted from the Bank s continued emphasis on growth in its loan portfolio. The decrease in the yield on loans, mortgage-backed securities and investment securities was the result of overall lower market interest rates and maturities of higher yielding investment securities. The yield on other interest earning assets increased as the balance was mainly comprised of relatively higher yielding FHLB stock.  
   
 Interest expense on deposits increased $524,000, or 16.6%, to $3.7 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to $3.2 million during the same 2015 period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $38.4 million, or 5.7% in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, while the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 10 basis points to 1.04% from 0.94%. The increase in the balance was the result of the Bank s continued efforts to emphasize deposit taking through business relationships. Interest expense on borrowed money increased approximately $638,000, or 54.3%, to $1.8 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016 when compared with $1.2 million during the same 2015 period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $113.6 million, or 100.8%, in the average balance of borrowings, partially offset by a decrease of 48 basis points in the cost of borrowings to 1.60% from 2.08%. Borrowings were used in part of fund loan demand. Net interest income increased $894,000, or 6.8%, during the six months ended September 30, 2016, to $14.0 million when compared to $13.1 million for the same 2015 period. The $152.0 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was due to increases of $113.6 million in borrowings and of $38.4 million in interest-bearing deposits. The net interest rate spread decreased 2 basis points due to a 7 basis points increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 5 basis point increase in the average yield earned on interest-bearing assets.  
   
 The provision for loan losses increased $858,000, or 496.0%, to $1.03 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $173,000 for the same period in 2015. The increase in the provision for the 2016 period was mainly due to the result of the significant increase in the balance of outstanding loans, partially offset by more favorable trends in qualitative factors related to delinquencies considered in the periodic review of the general valuation allowance. The allowance for loan losses is based on management s qualitative analysis, which includes an evaluation of economic and other factors. The Bank continually evaluates the need for a provision for loan losses based on its periodic review of the loan portfolio and general market conditions. See  Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  for a discussion of non-performing and impaired loans as of September 30, 2016, March 31, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  
   
 Non-interest income increased $62,000, or 6.4%, to $1.03 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $966,000 for the comparable period in 2015, mainly due to an increase of 64,000, or 61.0%, in fees and service charges on loans and deposits.  
   
 Non-interest expenses increased $1.7 million, or 18.6%, to $10.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $9.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of increases of $1.4 million, or 25.1%, in salaries and employee benefits, $104,000, or 13.9%, in occupancy expense of premises, $91,000, or 12.5%, in equipment expense, and $87,000, or 52.7%, in advertising and marketing expense, partially offset by a decrease of $95,000, or 20.3%, in professional services. The increase in salaries and employee benefits includes typical annual increases in compensation and benefits expenses and costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, as well as a related increase in employee stock ownership plan expense and expenses related to the granting of equity awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The increases in occupancy, equipment, and advertising and marketing expenses were mainly related to the costs of the newly opened Hoboken Banking Center, along with the costs associated with new customer products and services. Professional services decreased due to a decrease in legal fees.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company maintains levels of liquid assets sufficient to ensure the Bank s safe and sound operation. The Company adjusts its liquidity levels in order to meet funding needs for deposit outflows, payment of real estate taxes from escrow accounts on mortgage loans, repayment of borrowings, and loan funding commitments. The Company also adjusts its liquidity level as appropriate to meet its asset/liability objectives. Liquid assets, which include cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale, totaled $27.8 million, or 2.1% of total assets at September 30, 2016, as compared to $40.7 million, or 3.2% of total assets at March 31, 2016. The Company s liquidity is a product of its operating and financing activities. 
 The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity.  In addition to its operating expenses, the Company alone is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders. The Company also has consistently repurchased shares of its common stock. Its primary source of income is dividends received from the Bank. The amount of dividends that the Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from the OCC but with prior notice to the OCC, cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income for the preceding two calendar years. On a stand-alone basis, at September 30, 2016, the Company had liquid assets of $44.1 million, which included $39.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.1 million in securities available for sale. 
 Cash was generated by operating and financing activities and used by investing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2016. The primary sources of cash were net income, an increase in deposits, and proceeds from principal repayments, maturities and calls of securities and principal repayments on loans. The primary uses of funds were purchases of securities and loans, net loan originations, and the repurchase of common stock. Dividends declared and paid totaled $2.7 million during the six months ended September 30, 2016. 
 The Company s primary investing activities are the origination, participation, and purchase of loans, and the purchase of securities. Net loans amounted to $881.6 million and $780.2 million at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. Securities, including available for sale and held to maturity issues, totaled $317.1 million and $357.5 million at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. In addition to funding new loan production through operating and financing activities, such activities were funded by principal repayments, maturities, and calls on existing loans and securities.

    Liquidity and Capital Resources (Cont d)  
 Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short to intermediate-term investments. If the Bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, it can borrow funds from the FHLB under an overnight advance program up to the Bank s maximum borrowing capacity based on its ability to collateralize such borrowings. Members in good standing can borrow up to 50% of their assets as long as they have qualifying collateral to support the advance and purchase of FHLB capital stock. At September 30, 2016, advances from the FHLB amounted to $224.5 million at a weighted average rate of 1.63%. Additionally, the Bank has the ability to borrow funds of up to an aggregate of $58.0 million at two large financial institutions under established, unsecured, overnight lines of credit at a daily adjustable interest rate. 
 The Bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current commitments. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had outstanding commitments to originate one- to four-family mortgage loans totaling approximately $15.4 million which included $11.4 million for fixed rate loans and $4.0 million for adjustable rate loans.  
 At September 30, 2016, the Bank also had outstanding commitments to purchase one- to four-family fixed rate mortgage loans totaling approximately $5.3 million.  
 In addition, at September 30, 2016, the Bank had outstanding commitments to originate adjustable rate multi-family real estate loans of $15.0 million and commitments to originate adjustable rate commercial real estate loans of $26.4 million. 
 At September 30, 2016, undisbursed funds from customer approved unused lines of credit under a homeowners  equity lending program amounted to approximately $5.8 million. In addition, there were unused funds from commercial lines of credit of $2.7 million at rates that adjust to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate. Unless they are specifically cancelled by notice from the Bank, these funds represent firm commitments available to the respective borrowers on demand. At September 30, 2016, the Bank also had a commitment to originate a $2.0 million adjustable rate commercial line of credit, and a commitment of $85,000 to originate an adjustable rate equity line of credit.   
 Certificates of deposit due within one year at September 30, 2016 totaled $199.1 million, or 39.3% of total certificates of deposit. Management believes that, based on past experience and the Bank s deposit history, a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the Bank.  FHLB advances due within one year at September 30, 2016 totaled $93.0 million. 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements promulgated by the federal banking agencies. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company, and the OCC has similar requirements for the Bank. 
 Effective January 1, 2015, the Company adopted the Basel III final rule. Based on the Company s capital levels and statement of condition composition, the implementation of the new rule had no material impact on the Bank s regulatory capital level or ratios. The new rule establishes limits at the Company level and increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk based assets requirement from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets; established a new common equity Tier 1 capital; and assigned a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The new rule has a capital conservation buffer requirement that phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% percent of risk-weighted assets and increases each subsequent year by an additional 0.625 percent until reaching its final level of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective. Management believes, as of September 30, 2016 that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject.

    ITEM 3:  
      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
 Qualitative Analysis 
 The majority of the Bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, one of our most significant forms of market risk is interest rate risk. The Bank s assets consist primarily of residential and commercial real estate loans, and investment and mortgage-backed securities that have longer maturities than the Bank s liabilities, which consist primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of the Bank s business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of net interest income to change in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors, through its Enterprise Risk Management Committee, has established an Asset/Liability Management Committee that is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given the Bank s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the Asset/Liability Management Committee, which consists of senior management and one outside director, operates under a policy adopted by the Board of Directors, and meets as needed to review the Bank s asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position. 
 The Bank retains an independent, nationally recognized consulting firm that specializes in asset and liability management to complete the quarterly interest rate risk reports. This firm uses a combination of analyses to monitor the Bank s exposure to changes in interest rates. The economic value of equity analysis is a model that estimates the change in net portfolio value ( NPV ) over a range of instantaneously shocked interest rate scenarios. NPV is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. In calculating changes in NPV, assumptions estimating loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates that seem most likely based on historical experience during prior interest rate changes are used. 
 The net interest income analysis uses data derived from asset and liability analyses and applies several additional elements, including actual interest rate indices and margins, contractual limitations and the U.S. Treasury yield curve as of the balance sheet date. In addition, the model uses consistent parallel yield curve ramps (in both directions) to determine possible changes in net interest income if the theoretical yield curve ramps occurred gradually. Net interest income analysis also adjusts the asset and liability repricing analyses based on changes in prepayment rates resulting from the parallel yield curve shifts. 
 The asset and liability analyses determine the relative balance between the repricing of assets and liabilities over multiple periods of time (ranging from overnight to five years). These asset and liability analyses include expected cash flows from loans and mortgage-backed securities, applying prepayment rates based on the differential between the current interest rate and the market interest rate for each loan and security type. These analyses identify mismatches in the timing of asset and liability repricing but do not necessarily provide an accurate indicator of interest rate risk because the assumptions used may not reflect the actual response to market changes.

  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
        Q  uantitative Analysis (Cont d)  
 The table below sets forth, as of June 30, 2016, the most recent date the Bank s interest rate risk was measured, the estimated changes in the Bank s NPV and net interest income that would result from the designated changes in interest rates. Given the current economic environment, the Bank expects that these changes as of September 30, 2016 will not materially differ from the results presented. This data is for the Bank and its subsidiary only and does not include any assets of Company. Such changes to interest rates are calculated as an immediate and permanent change for the purposes of computing NPV and a gradual change over a one-year period for the purposes of computing net interest income. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. We estimate changes in NPV or net interest income for an interest rate decrease of 100 basis points or an increase of 200 basis points. 

(1)   
 
 Assumes an instantaneous and parallel shift in interest rates at all maturities.    

(2)   
 
 NPV is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.    

(3)   
 
 Assumes a gradual change in interest rates over a one-year period at all maturities.    

 The table set forth above indicates that at June 30, 2016, in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would be expected to experience a 20.9% decrease in NPV and a $1.3 million, or 4.6%, decrease in net interest income. In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would be expected to experience a 1.5% increase in NPV and a $237,000, or 0.8%, decrease in net interest income. NPV is a theoretical liquidation calculation that assumes the Bank is no longer a going concern and that the net interest income simulation is built upon a static (no growth or attrition) balance sheet. Accordingly, this data does not reflect any future actions management may take in response to changes in interest rates. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in any methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in NPV and net interest income require certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the NPV and net interest income table presented above assumes the composition of the Bank s interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and, accordingly, the data does not reflect any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates such as changing the mix of assets and liabilities, which could change the results of the NPV and net interest income calculations. The table also assumes a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or the repricing characteristics of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV and net interest income table provides an indication of the Bank s sensitivity to interest rate changes at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effects of changes in market interest rates on the Bank s NPV and net interest income and will differ from actual results.

CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT  
   
 THIS AGREEMENT  is entered into as of April 1, 2016, by and between Clifton Savings Bank (the  Bank ) and Michael Lesler ( Executive ).  
   
 WHEREAS,  the Bank will employ Executive in a position of importance to the Bank s operations and wishes to protect his position with the Bank in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in this Agreement   
   
 NOW THEREFORE,  in consideration of these premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of   which   are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows.  
   
 1.    Term    of   Agreement. 
   
 (a) The    term   of   this   Agreement   shall   commence   as   of   April l, 2016   (the   "Effective   Date")   and   expire on the first anniversary of such date, unless otherwise extended as noted under Section l(b) of this Agreement. 
   
 (b) On    or before the first   anniversary of   the Effective   Date,   and    each    anniversary of   such    date thereafter,   the Compensation Committee of   the Board   of   Directors   of   the Bank   may   extend the   term   of   the Agreement for   an   additional year,   so   that    the remaining term of   the   Agreement again  becomes twelve (12) months   from   the   applicable   anniversary   date,   unless   Executive   elects   not   to   extend   the   term   of   this   Agreement by   giving   written    notice   at   least   thirty   (30)   days   prior   to   the   applicable   anniversary   date.   The   Board   of   Directors will   notify   Executive   at   least   thirty   (30)   days   prior   to   the   applicable   anniversary   date   whether it   has   determined to   extend   the   Agreement. 
   
 (c) Notwithstanding anything in    this   Section 1   to the contrary, this Agreement shall terminate immediately if Executive   or the Bank   terminates   Executive's   employment prior   to a   Change   in   Control   (as defined   in   this   Agreement). 
   
 2.  Change   in   Control. 
   
 (a) Upon    the   occurrence of   a   Change   in   Control   (as   defined in   this   Agreement)   followed   at   any   time during   the   term   of   this   Agreement   by   the   termination   of   Executive's   employment in   accordance   with   the   terms of   this   Agreement, other than for   Just   Cause,   as   defined in   Section   2(c)   of   this   Agreement, the provisions   of Section   3   of   this   Agreement   shall   apply.   Upon   the   occurrence of   a   Change   in   Control,   Executive   shall   have   the right   to   elect   to   voluntarily   terminate   his   employment   at   any   time   during   the   term   of   this   Agreement   following an   event   constituting "Good   Reason."   Good   Reason"   means,   unless   Executive   has   consented   in   writing   thereto, the   occurrence   following   a   Change   in   Control,   of   any   of   the   following: 

(i)   
 
 the    assignment     to    Executive    of    any    duties     materially    inconsistent     with    Executive's position,   including     any     material      change      in     status,      title,      authority,      duties      or responsibilities   or   any   other    action    that    results    in   a   material    diminution    in   such   status, title,    authority,     duties     or     responsibilities,     excluding    for     this     purpose     an    isolated, insubstantial    and   inadvertent   action    not   taken    in   bad   faith   and   that    is   remedied    by   the Bank   or   Executive's   employer    reasonably    promptly   after    receipt   of   notice   thereof    given by   the   Executive;    

(ii)      
 
   a   reduction by   the   Bank   of   the Executive's   base   salary   in   effect immediately prior   to   the Change   in   Control;    

(iii)   
 
 the   relocation   of   the   Executive's   office   to   a   location   more   than   thirty-five   (35)   miles   from its   location   as   of   the   date   of   this   Agreement;    

(iv)   
 
 the   taking   of any   action   by   the   Bank   or   successors   that   would   materially   adversely   affect the   Executive's   overall   compensation   and   benefits   package,   unless   such   changes   to   the compensation   and   benefits   package   are   made   on   a   non-discriminatory   basis to   all employees;   or    

(v)   
 
 the   failure   of   the   Bank   to   obtain   the   assumption   in   writing   of   the   Bank's   obligation   to perform   this   Agreement   by   any   successor   to   all   or   substantially   all   of   the   assets   of   the Bank   within   thirty   (30)   days   after   a   reorganization,   merger,   consolidation,   sale   or   other disposition   of   assets   of   the   Bank.    

(b)  For   purposes   of   this   Agreement,   a   "Change   in   Control"   shall   be   deemed   to   occur   on   the   earliest of   any   of   the   following   events: 

(i)   
 
  Merger :    The Company or the Bank merges into or consolidates with another corporation,   or   merges   another corporation into   the   Company   or   the Bank,   and   as   a result   less   than   a   majority   of   the   combined   voting   power   of   the resulting   corporation immediately   after   the   merger   or   consolidation   is   held   by   persons   who   were   stockholders of   the   Company   or   the   Bank   immediately   before   the   merger   or   consolidation;    

(ii)   
 
  Acquisition of Significant Share Ownership :  There   is   filed   or   required   to   be   filed a   report on   Schedule   13D   or   another   form   or   schedule   (other   than   Schedule   13G)   required   under Sections   13(d)   or   14(d)   of   the   Securities   Exchange   Act   of   1934,   if   the   schedule   discloses that   the   filing   person   or   persons   acting   in   concert   has   or   have   become   the    beneficial owner   of   25%   or   more   of   a   class of   the   Company's   voting   securities,   but   this   clause   (b) shall   not   apply   to    beneficial   ownership   of   Company   voting   shares    held   in    a   fiduciary capacity   by   an   entity   of   which   the   Company   directly   or   indirectly   beneficially   owns   50% or   more   of   its   outstanding   voting   securities;   or    

(iii)      
 
    Sale     of     Assets :   The Company   sells   to   a   third   party   all   or   substantially all   of its   assets.     

Notwithstanding   anything   in   this   Agreement   to   the   contrary,   a   "Change   in   Control"   shall   not result from the consummation of any transaction or series of transactions constituting a "second-step conversion"   of   the Company and the Bank   resulting   in   the   ownership   of   the   Bank   by   an   entity   controlled   by   public shareholders. 
   
 (c) Executive shall not    have   the   right   to   receive   termination   benefits   pursuant   to   Section   3   hereof upon termination for   Just   Cause.   The   term   "Just Cause"   shall   mean termination because of   Executive's personal   dishonesty,   incompetence, willful   misconduct,   any   breach   of   fiduciary   duty   involving   personal   profit, intentional   failure   to perform   stated duties, willful   violation   of   any   law,   rule,   regulation   (other   than traffic violations   or   similar   offenses),   final   cease   and   desist   order, or   any   material   breach   of   any   provision   of   this Agreement.    Notwithstanding   the   foregoing,   Executive shall   not   be   deemed   to   have   been   terminated   for   Just Cause   unless   and    until   there    shall   have   been   delivered   to    him   a   copy   of   a   resolution   duly   adopted    by the affirmative   vote   of   a   majority   of   the   entire   membership   of   the   Board   of   Directors   at   a   meeting   of   the   Board   of Directors   called   and   held   for   that    purpose   (after   reasonable   notice   to   Executive   and   an   opportunity   for   him, together   with   counsel,   to   be   heard   before   the Board of Directors),   finding   that   in   the   good   faith opinion   of   the Board   of   Directors,   Executive   was   guilty   of   conduct justifying termination   for   Just   Cause   and   specifying   the particulars   thereof in detail.   Executive   shall   not   have   the right   to   receive   compensation   or   other benefits   for any   period   after   termination   for   Just Cause. 
   
 3.     Termination   Benefits. 
   
 (a) lf Executive's    employment   is   voluntarily   (in   accordance   with   Section   2(a)   of   this   Agreement)   or involuntarily   terminated   within   one   (1)   year   of   a Change   in   Control,   Executive   shall   receive: 

(i)   
 
 a lump   sum cash payment   equal to one  (1)    times his   annual base   salary   as   of his termination date.   Such   payment   shall   be   made not   later   than five   (5)   days   following Executive's   termination   of   employment   under   this   Section   3.    

(ii)   
 
 Continued   benefit   coverage   under   all   Bank   health   and   welfare   plans   which   Executive participated in   as   of   the date of   the Change   in Control   (collectively,   the "Employee Benefit   Plans") for   a   period   of    twelve  (12)   months   following   Executive's   termination   of employment.   Said   coverage   shall   be   provided   under   the   same   terms   and   conditions   in effect   on   the date of   Executive's termination of   employment.   Solely   for   purposes   of benefits   continuation   under   the   Employee   Benefit   Plans,   Executive   shall   be   deemed to be   an   active   employee.   To   the extent that benefits   required under   this   Section   3(a) cannot   be   provided   under   the   terms   of   any   Employee   Benefit   Plan,   the   Bank   shall   enter into   alternative   arrangements   that   will   provide   Executive   with   comparable   benefits.    

(b) Notwithstanding    the    preceding   provisions   of   this   Section   3,    in   no   event    shall   the    aggregate payments   or   benefits   to   be   made   or   afforded   to   Executive   under   said   paragraphs   (the   "Termination   Benefits") or   otherwise    by   the   Company   or   the    Bank   constitute   an   "excess   parachute   payment''   under   Section   280G   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code   of   1986,    as   amended   (the   "Code"),   or   any   successor   thereto,    and   to   avoid   such   a result,   Termination   Benefits   will   be   reduced,   if    necessary,   to   an   amount   (the   "Non-Triggering   Amount"),   the value   of   which   is   one   dollar   ($1.00)    less   than   an   amount   equal   to   three   (3)   times   Executive's   "base   amount,"   as determined    in   accordance    with   said   Section   280G.   The   reduction  

required     hereby     among     the     Termination Benefits provided by     this     Section 3     shall     be made to the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement.  
   
 4.     Notice   of   Termination. 
   
 (a) Any    purported termination by   the Bank   or   by   Executive   shall   be   communicated by   Notice   of Termination   to   the   other   party   hereto.   For   purposes   of   this   Agreement,   a   "Notice   of   Termination"   shall   mean   a written   notice   which   shall   indicate   the   specific   termination provision   in this   Agreement   relied   upon   and   shall set   forth   in   detail   the   facts   and   circumstances   claimed   to   provide   a   basis for   termination of   Executive's employment   under   the   provision   so   indicated. 
   
 (b)  "Date   of   Termination"   shall   mean   the   date   specified   in   the   Notice   of   Termination   (which,   in   the case   of   a   termination for   Just   Cause,   shall   not be   less   than   thirty   (30) days   from   the   date such   Notice   of Termination   is   given). 
   
 5.    Source    of   Payments. 
   
 All payments   provided   in   this   Agreement   shall   be   timely   paid   in   cash   or   check   from   the   general   funds of   the   Bank. 
   
 6.    Effect    on   Prior   Agreements   and   Existing   Benefit   Plans. 
   
 This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding between the Bank and Executive, except that this Agreement shall not affect or operate to reduce any benefit or compensation inuring to Executive of a kind elsewhere provided. No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted to mean that Executive is subject to receiving fewer benefits than those available to him without reference to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon Executive the right to continue in the employ of the Bank or shall impose on the Bank any obligation to employ or retain Executive in its employ for any period. 
   
 7.    No    Attachment;   Binding   Effect. 
   
 (a) Except    as   required   by   law,   no   right   to   receive   payments   under   this   Agreement   shall   be   subject   to anticipation,   commutation,   alienation,   sale,   assignment,   encumbrance,   charge,   pledge,   or   hypothecation   or   to execution,   attachment,   levy   or   similar   process   or   assignment   by   operation   of   Jaw,   and   any   attempt, voluntary or   involuntary,   to   affect   any   such   action   shall be   null, void   and   of   no   effect.

If   the   charges   in   the   notice   are   dismissed,   the Bank   may   in   its   discretion:   (i) pay   Executive   all   or part   of   the compensation   withheld   while   its   contract obligations   were suspended; and (ii)   reinstate (in   whole   or in part) any   of   the obligations which were suspended. 
   
 (c) If    Executive is   removed   and/or permanently   prohibited   from   participating   in   the   conduct   of   the Bank's   affairs by   an   order   issued   under   Section   8(e)(4)   or   8(g)(1)   of   the   Federal   Deposit   Insurance   Act,   12   U.S.C.  1818(e)(4)   or   (g)(l),   all   obligations   of   the   Bank   under   this   contract   shall   terminate   as   of   the   effective   date   of the   order,   but   vested   rights   of   the   contracting   parties   shalt   not   be   affected. 

(d)  If the Bank     is     in     default     as     defined     in     Section     3(x)(l)     of     the Federal     Deposit     Insurance     Act,     12 U.S.C.      1813(x)(l)     all     obligations     of     the     Bank     under     this     contract     shall     terminate     as     of     the     date     of     default,     but     this paragraph     shall     not     affect     any     vested     rights     of     the     contracting     parties.  
   
 (e) All    obligations   under   this   Agreement   shalt   be   terminated,   except   to   the   extent   a determination   is made   that   continuation   of   the   contract   is   necessary   for   the   continued   operation   of   the   Bank    (i)   by   the   director of   the   Office   of   the   Comptroller   of   the   Currency   (the   "OCC")   or   his or   her   designee   (the   "Director"),   at   the   time the    OCC   enters    into   an   agreement    to    provide   assistance   to   or   on    behalf   of   the    Bank   under   the    authority contained   in   Section   13(c)   of   the   Federal   Deposit   Insurance   Act;   or   (ii)   by   the   Director,   at   the   time   the   Director approves   a   supervisory   merger   to   resolve   problems   related   to   the   operations   of   the   Bank   or   when   the   Bank   is determined    by   the   Director   to   be   in   an   unsafe   or   unsound   condition.   Any   rights   of   Executive   that   have   already vested,   however,   shalt   not   be   affected   by   such   action. 
   
 (f) Any    payments   made   to   employees   pursuant   to   this   Agreement,   or   otherwise,   are   subject   to   and conditioned upon   their   compliance   with   12   U.S.C.    1828(k)   and FDIC regulation   12   C.F.R.

 17.    Section    409A of the Code. 
   
 (a) This    Agreement   is   intended   to   comply   with   the   requirements   of   Section   409A   of   the   Code,   and specifically,   with   the   "short-term   deferral   exception"   under   Treasury   Regulation   Section   1.409A-l(b)(4)   and   the "separation pay   exception"   under   Treasury   Regulation   Section   1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii),   and   shall   in all   respects   be administered in   accordance   with   Section   409A   of   the   Code.   If   any   payment   or   benefit   hereunder cannot   be provided   or   made   at   the   time   specified   herein   without   incurring sanctions   on   Executive   under   Section   409A   of the   Code,   then such   payment   or   benefit   shall   be   provided   in   full   at   the   earliest   time   thereafter   when   such sanctions   will   not   be   imposed.   For   purposes   of   Section   409A   of   the   Code,   all   payments   to   be   made   upon   a termination   of employment   under   this   Agreement   may   only   be   made   upon   a   "separation   from   service"   (within the   meaning   of   such   term   under   Section   409A   of   the   Code),   each   payment   made   under   this   Agreement   shall   be treated    as   a   separate  payment,   the   right   to   a   series   of installment   payments   under   this   Agreement   (if   any)   is   to be   treated    as   a   right   to    o    series    of   separate    payments,   and    if    a    payment   is   not   made    by   the    designated payment   date    under   this   Agreement,   the    payment   shall   be   made    by   December   31   of   the   calendar   year   in which   the   designated   date   occurs.   To   the   extent   that   any   payment   provided   for   hereunder   would   be   subject   to additional   tax   under   Section   409A   of   the   Code,   or   would   cause   the   administration   of   this   Agreement   to   fail   to satisfy   the requirements of   Section   409A   of   the   Code,   such   provision   shall   be   deemed null   and   void   to   the extent permitted by   applicable   law,   and   any   such   amount   shall   be   payable   in   accordance   with   subparagraph (b) of   this   Agreement   below.   In   no   event   shall   Executive,   directly   or   indirectly,   designate   the   calendar   year   of 
 payment. 
   
 (b) If,    when   separation   from   service   occurs,   Executive   is   a   "specified   employee"   within   the   meaning of   Section   409A   of   the   Code, and   if   the   cash   severance   payment   under   Section   3(a)(i)   of   this   Agreement   would be   considered   deferred   compensation    under   Section   409A   of   the   Code,   and,   finally,   if    an   exemption   from   the six-month   delay   requirement    of   Section   409A(a)(2)(B)(i)    of   the    Code   is   not   available   (i.e.,   the    "short-term deferral    exception"    under   Treasury  Regulations   Section   1.409A-l(b)(4)   or  the    "separation    pay   exception" under    Treasury   Section   1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)),    the    Bank   or  the    Company   will   make   the    maximum   severance payment    possible   in    order    to    comply   with   an   exception    from    the    six-month   requirement    and    make   any remaining   severance    payment    under   Section   3(a)(i)   of   this   Agreement   to    Executive   in   a   single   lump   sum  without      inter  e  st      on     t  h  e     f  i  r  s  t     payroll     date     that     occurs     after     t  h  e      date     that      i  s     six     (6)     mont  h  s     after     the     date     on which     Executive     sep  a  rat  e  s     from     service.

Exhibit 10.2  
   
 CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT 
   
 THIS AGREEMENT  is entered into as of September 12, 2016, by and between Clifton Savings Bank (the  Bank ) and Diane Scriveri ( Executive ).  
   
 WHEREAS,  the Bank will employ Executive in a position of importance to the Bank s operations and wishes to protect his position with the Bank in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in this Agreement   
   
 NOW THEREFORE,  in consideration of these premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows.  
   
 1. Term of Agreement.  
   
 (a)  The term of this Agreement shall commence as of September 12, 2016 (the "Effective Date") and expire on the first anniversary of such date, unless otherwise extended as noted under Section 1(b) of this Agreement. 
   
 (b)  On or  before  the first  anniversary of the Effective Date, and each anniversary of such date thereafter, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank may extend the term of the Agreement for an additional year ,  so that the remaining term of the Agreement again becomes twelve (12) months from the applicable anniversary date ,  unless Executive elects not to extend the term of this Agreement by giving written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the applicable anniversary date. The Board of Directors will notify Executive at least thirty (30) days prior to the applicable anniversary date whether it has determined to extend the Agreement. 
   
 (c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1 to the contrary ,  th is  Agreement shall terminate immediately if Executive or the Bank t e rminates Executive's employment prior to a Change in Control (as defined in this Agreement) .  
   
 2. Change in Control.  
   
 (a) Upon th  e  occurrence of a Change in Control ( a s defined in this Agreement) followed at any time during the term of this Agreement by the termination of Executive's employment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, oth e r than for Just Cause, as defined in Section 2(c) of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 3 of this Agreement shall apply .  Upon the o c currence of a Change in Control, Executive shall have the right to elect to voluntarily terminat e  his employment at any time during the term of this Agreement following an event constituting "Good Reason . " Good Reason" means, unless Executive has consented in writing thereto, the occurrence following a Change in Control, of any of the following: 

(i)   
 
 the  assignment  to  Executive of  any duti e s  materially  inconsistent  with  Executive's position,    including   any   material   change   in   status,  title,    authority ,   duties   or responsibilities or any other action that results in a material diminution  in  s uch status, titl e ,  authority,   duties  or  responsibilities,  excluding  for  this  purpose  an  isolated ,  insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and that is remedied by the Bank or Executive ' s employer reason a bly promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;    

(ii)   
 
 a reduction by the Bank of the E xe cutive ' s base salary in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control;    

(iii)   
 
 the relocation of the Executive's office to a location more than thirty-five (35) miles from its location as of the date of this Agreement;    

(iv)   
 
 the taking of any action by the Bank or successors that would materially adversely affect the Executive's overall compensation and benefits package, unless such changes to the compensation and benefits package are made on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees; or    

(v)   
 
 the failure of the Bank to obtain the assumption in writing of the Bank's obligation to perform this Agreement by any successor to all or substantially all of the assets of the Bank within thirty (30) days after a reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale or other disposition of assets of the Bank.    

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to occur on the earliest of any of the following events:  

(i)   
 
  Merger:    The Company or the Bank merges into or consolidates with another corporation, or merges another corporation into the Company or the Bank, and as a result less than a majority of the combined voting power of the resulting corporation immediately after the merger or consolidation is held by persons who were stockholders of the Company or the Bank immediately before the merger or consolidation;    

(ii)   
 
  Acquisition of Significant Share Ownership : There is filed or required to be filed a report on Schedule 13D or another form or schedule (other than Schedule 13G) required under Sections 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, if the schedule discloses that  the filing person or persons acting in concert has or have become the beneficial owner of 25% or more of a class of the Company's voting securities, but this clause (b) shall not apply to  beneficial ownership  of Company voting shares held in a fiduciary capacity by an entity of which the Company directly or indirectly beneficially owns SO% or more of its outstanding voting securities; or    

(iii)    
 
  Sale of Assets : The Company sells to a third party all or substantially all of its assets.     

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a "Change in Control" shall not result from the consummation of any transaction or series of transactions constituting a "second-step conversion" of the Company and Bank resulting in the ownership of the Bank by an entity controlled by public shareholders. 
   
 (c) Executive shall not have the right to receive termination benefits pursuant to Section 3 hereof upon termination for Just Cause. The term "Just Cause" shall mean termination because of Executive's personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, any breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule, regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses), final cease and desist order, or any material breach of any provision of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated  for Just Cause unless and until  there  shall have been delivered  to  him a copy of a resolution  duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board of Directors called and held for that  purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity  for him, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board of Directors), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, Executive was guilty of conduct justifying termination  for Just Cause and specifying the    particulars thereof in detail. Executive shall not have the right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after termination for Just Cause. 
   
 3. Termination Benefits.  
   
 (a)  If Executive's employment is voluntarily (in accordance with Section 2(a) of this Agreement) or involuntarily terminated within one (1) year of a Change in Control, Executive shall receive: 

(i)      
 
 a lump sum cash payment equal to two (2) times his annual base salary as of his termination date. Such payment shall be made not later than five (5) days following Executive's termination of employment under this Section 3.    

(ii)    
 
 Continued benefit coverage under all Bank health and welfare plans which Executive participated in as of the date of the Change in Control (collectively, the "Employee Benefit Plans") for a period of twenty-four (24) months following   Executive's termination of employment. Said coverage shall be provided under the same terms and conditions in effect on the date of Executive's termination of employment. Solely for purposes of benefits continuation under the Employee Benefit Plans, Executive shall be deemed to be an active employee. To the extent that benefits required under this Section 3(a) cannot be provided under the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan, the Bank shall enter into alternative arrangements that will provide Executive with comparable benefits.    

(b) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 3, in no event shall the  aggregate payments or benefits to be made or afforded to Executive under said paragraphs (the "Termination Benefits") or otherwise by the Company or the Bank constitute an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any successor thereto, and to avoid such a result, Termination Benefits will  be reduced, if necessary, to an amount (the "Non-Triggering Amount"), the value of which is one dollar ($1.00) less than an amount equal to three (3) times Executive's "base amount," as determined  in accordance with  said Section 280G. The reduction required hereby among the Termination Benefits provided by this Section 3 shall be made to the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement.  

4.  Notice of Termination.  
 (a)  Any purported termination by the Bank or by Executive shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a written notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment under the provision so indicated. 
   
 (b)  "Date of Termination" shall mean the date specified in the Notice of Termination (which, in the case of a termination for Just Cause, shall not be less than thirty (30) days from the date such Notice of Termination is given). 
   
 5. Source of Payments.  
   
 All payments provided in this Agreement shall be timely paid in cash or check from the general funds of the Bank. 
   
 6. Effect on Prior Agreements and Existing Benefit Plans.  
   
 This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding between the Bank and Executive, except that this Agreement shall not affect or operate to reduce any benefit or compensation inuring to Executive of a kind elsewhere provided. No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted to mean that Executive is subject to receiving fewer benefits than those available to him without reference to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon Executive the right to continue in the employ of the Bank or shall impose on the Bank any obligation to employ or retain Executive in its employ for any period. 
   
 7. No Attachment; Binding Effect.  
   
 (a) Except as required by law, no right to receive payments under this Agreement shall be subject to anticipation, commutation, alienation, sale, assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge, or hypothecation or to execution, attachment, levy or similar process or assignment by operation of law, and any attempt, voluntary or involuntary, to affect any such action shall be null, void and of no effect.  
   
 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, Executive, the Bank and their respective successors and assigns.  
   
 8. Modification and Waiver.  
   
 (a)  This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. 
   
 (b)  No term or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived, nor shall there be any estoppel against the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement, except by written instrument of the party charged with such waiver or estoppel. No such written waiver shall be deemed a continuing waiver unless specifically stated therein, and each such waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition waived and shall not constitute a waiver of such term or condition for the future or as to any act other than that specifically waived. 
   
 9. Severability.  
   
 If, for any reason, any provision of this Agreement, or any part of any provision, is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement or any part of such provision not held so invalid, and each such other provision and part thereof shall to the full extent consistent with law continue in full force and effect. 
   
 10. Headings for Reference Only.  
   
 The headings of sections and paragraphs herein are included solely for convenience of reference and shall not control the meaning or interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, references herein to the masculine shall apply to both the masculine and the feminine. 

11.  Governing   law.  
   
 Except to the extent preempted by federal law, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to principles of conflicts of law of that State. 
   
 12. Arbitration.  
   
 Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration, conducted before a panel of three arbitrators sitting in a location selected by Executive within fifty (SO) miles from the location of the Bank, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction; provided, however, that Executive shall be entitled to seek specific performance of his right to be paid until the Date of Termination during the pendency of any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement. 
   
 13. Payment of Legal Fees.  
   
 All reasonable legal fees paid or incurred by Executive pursuant to any dispute or question of interpretation relating to this Agreement shall be paid or reimbursed by the Bank, only if Executive is successful pursuant to a legal judgment, arbitration or settlement. 
   
 14. Indemnification.  
   
 The Bank shall provide  Executive (including his heirs, executors and administrators)  with  coverage under a standard directors' and officers' liability insurance policy at its expense and shall indemnify Executive (and his heirs, executors and administrators) to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law against all expenses and liabilities  reasonably incurred  by him in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which he may be involved by reason of him having been an officer of the Bank (whether or not he continues to be an officer at the time of incurring such expenses or liabilities), such expenses and liabilities to  include, but  not  be  limited  to, judgments, court  costs, attorneys'  fees and  the  cost  of  reasonable settlements. 
   
 15. Successors to the Bank.  
   
 The Bank shall require any successor or assignee, whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Bank, expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Bank's obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Bank would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place. 
   
 16. Required Provisions.  
   
 In the event any of the provisions of this Section 16 are in conflict with the terms of this Agreement, this Section 16 shall prevail. 
   
 (a) The Board of Directors may terminate Executive's employment at any time, but any termination by the Bank, other than termination for Just Cause, shall not prejudice Executive's right to compensation or other benefits under this Agreement.  Executive shall not have the right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after termination for Cause.  
   
 (b) If Executive is suspended from office and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Bank's affairs by a notice served under Section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C.  1818(e)(3) or (g)(l), the Bank's obligations under this contract shall be suspended as of the date of service, unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the Bank may in its discretion: (i) pay Executive all or part of the compensation withheld while its contract    obligations were suspended; and (ii) reinstate (in whole or in part) any of the obligations which were suspended. 
   
 (c) If Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Bank's affairs by an order issued under Section 8(e)(4) or 8(g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C.  1818(e)(4) or (g)(1), all obligations of the Bank under this contract shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested rights of the contracting parties shall not be affected.  

(d)  If the Bank is in default as defined in Section 3(x)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C.  1813(x)(1) all obligations of the Bank under this contract shall terminate as of the date of default, but this paragraph shall not affect any vested rights of the contracting parties.  
   
 (e) All obligations under this Agreement shall be terminated, except to the extent a determination is made that continuation of the contract is necessary for the continued operation of the Bank (i) by the director of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") or his or her designee (the "Director"), at the time the  OCC enters  into  an agreement  to  provide  assistance to or  on behalf of the  Bank under the authority contained in Section 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; or  (ii) by the Director, at the time the Director approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to the operations of the Bank or when the Bank is determined  by the Director to be in an unsafe or unsound condition. Any rights of Executive that have already vested, however, shall not be affected by such action. 
   
 (f)  Any payments made to employees pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with 12 U.S.C.  1828(k) and FDIC regulation 12 C.F.R. Part 359, Golden Parachute and Indemnification Payments. 
   
 17. Section 409A of the Code.  
   
 (a) This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and specifically, with the "short-term deferral exception" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and the "separation pay exception" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), and shall in all respects be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. If any payment or benefit hereunder cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring sanctions on Executive under Section 409A of the Code, then such payment or benefit shall be provided in full at the earliest time thereafter when such sanctions will not be imposed. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, all payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a "separation from service" (within the meaning of such term under Section 409A of the Code), each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement (if any) is to be treated  as a  right  to  a  series of  separate payments, and if a  payment is not made by the  designated payment  date under this Agreement, the payment  shall be made by December 31 of the calendar year in which the designated date occurs. To the extent that any payment provided for hereunder would be subject to additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, or would cause the administration of this Agreement to fail to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, such provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by applicable law, and any such amount shall be payable in accordance with subparagraph (b) of this Agreement below. In no event shall Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment.  
   
 (b)  If, when separation from service occurs, Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and if the cash severance payment under Section 3(a)(i) of this Agreement would be considered deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and, finally, if an exemption from the six-month delay  requirement of  Section  409A(a)(2)(B)(i)  of  the  Code is not  available  (i.e., the  "short-term deferral exception" under  Treasury  Regulations  Section  1.409A-l(b)(4) or  the  "separation pay exception" under  Treasury  Section  1.409A-l(b)(9)(iii)), the  Bank or  the  Company  will  make  the  maximum severance payment possible  in  order  to comply  with  an exception from  the  six-month  requirement and  make any remaining severance  payment under  Section  3(a)(i)  of  this  Agreement  to  Executive  in a single lump  sum without interest on  the  first  payroll date that  occurs after  the  date  that is six (6) months  after  the  date on which Executive separates from service. 
   
 (c) If (x) under  the  terms  of the  applicable  policy  or  policies for  the  insurance  or other  benefits specified  in Section 3(a)(ii)  of  this  Agreement  it  is not  possible to  continue  coverage for  Executive and his dependents, or  (y) when  a separation from  service  occurs  Executive is a  "specified  employee" within  the meaning  of  Section  409A  of  the  Code, and  if any  of  the  continued insurance  coverage  or other  benefits specified in Section 3(a)(ii) of this Agreement  would  be considered deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and, finally, if an exemption from the  six-month  delay requirement of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code is not  available  for  that  particular insurance  or other  benefit, the Bank shall pay to Executive in a single lump  sum an amount in cash equal to the present  value of  the Bank's projected cost to maintain that particular insurance  benefit had  Executive's  employment not  terminated. The Jump-sum payment shall be made thirty (30) days after employment termination or, if Section 17(b) of this Agreement applies, on the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six (6) months after the date on which Executive separates from service.  
   
 (d) References in this Agreement to Section 409A of the Code include rules, regulations and guidance of general application issued by the Department of the Treasury under Section 409A of the Code.
