GULFPORT ENERGY CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Gulfport Energy Corporation (the  Company  or  Gulfport ) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods, on a basis consistent with the annual audited consolidated financial statements.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Certain information, accounting policies, and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the summary of significant accounting policies and notes thereto included in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K.  Results for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year.  
   
           1. 
    ACQUISITIONS 
     In April 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Paloma Partners III, LLC ("Paloma") for a total purchase price of approximately   $301.9 million  , subject to certain adjustments.  Paloma holds approximately   24,000   net nonproducing acres in the Utica Shale of Ohio.  In accordance with the agreement, the Company deposited   $75.0 million   into an escrow account.  At the closing of the transaction the deposit was credited toward the purchase price.  This transaction closed on August 31, 2015 for a purchase price of approximately   $302.3 million  , net of purchase price adjustments.  At closing, approximately   $30.1 million   of the purchase price was placed in escrow as security to the Company for potential indemnification claims that may occur as a result of the sale.  
  On June 9, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of   6,198   gross and net acres located in Belmont and Jefferson Counties, Ohio from American Energy-Utica, LLC ("AEU") for a purchase price of approximately   $68.2 million  , subject to adjustment.  On June 12, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of   38,965   gross (  27,228   net) acres located in Monroe County, Ohio,   14.6   MMcf per day of average net production (estimated for April 2015),   18   gross (  11.3   net) drilled but uncompleted wells, an   11   mile gas gathering system and a   four   well pad location from AEU for a total purchase price of approximately   $319.0 million   (the "Monroe Acquisition").  On June 29, 2015, the Company acquired an additional   4,950   gross (  1,900   net) acres in Monroe County for an additional   $18.2 million   from AEU.  The total purchase price of these transactions, collectively referred to as the ("AEU Acquisition"), was approximately   $405.4 million   (  $405.0 million   net of purchase price adjustments).  At closing, approximately   $67.1 million   of the purchase price was placed in escrow pending completion of title review after the closing.  In December 2015, approximately   $2.4 million   of the escrow was released and returned to the Company with the balance of the escrow account distributed to the seller based on final title review. 
  The AEU Acquisition qualified as a business combination for accounting purposes and, as such, the Company estimated the fair value of the acquired properties as of the June 12, 2015 acquisition date.  The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired was estimated using assumptions that represent Level 3 inputs.  See Note 12 for additional discussion of the measurement inputs. 
    The Company estimated that the consideration paid in the AEU Acquisition for these properties approximated the fair value that would be paid by a typical market participant.  As a result, no goodwill or bargain purchase gain was recognized in conjunction with the purchase.    
    The following table summarizes the consideration paid in the AEU Acquisition to acquire the properties and the fair value amount of the assets acquired as of June 12, 2015.  Both the consideration paid and the fair value assigned to the assets is preliminary and subject to adjustment upon final closing.

    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
     The major categories of property and equipment and related accumulated depletion, depreciation, amortization and impairment as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016  , the net book value of the Company's oil and natural gas properties was above the calculated ceiling as a result of the reduced commodity prices for the period leading up to   September 30, 2016  .  As a result, the Company recorded an impairment of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting of   $212.2 million   and   $601.8 million   for   the three and     nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. An impairment of     $594.8 million     was required for oil and natural gas properties for the three and     nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Included in oil and natural gas properties at   September 30, 2016   is the cumulative capitalization of   $122.8 million   in general and administrative costs incurred and capitalized to the full cost pool.  General and administrative costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management s estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities.  All general and administrative costs not directly associated with exploration and development activities were charged to expense as they were incurred.  Capitalized general and administrative costs were approximately $  7.2 million   and $  22.2 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and $  7.3 million   and $  20.8 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  The following table summarizes the Company s non-producing properties excluded from amortization by area at   September 30, 2016  :

     Table of Contents  

At   December 31, 2015  , approximately   $1.8 billion   of non-producing leasehold costs was not subject to amortization.  
  The Company evaluates the costs excluded from its amortization calculation at least annually.  Subject to industry conditions and the level of the Company s activities, the inclusion of most of the above referenced costs into the Company s amortization calculation typically occurs within   three   to   five   years.  However, the majority of the Company's non-producing leases have   five  -year extension terms which could extend this time frame beyond five years. 
  A reconciliation of the Company's asset retirement obligation for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows:

  Summarized results of operations:       

  Tatex Thailand II, LLC 
  The Company has an indirect ownership interest in Tatex Thailand II, LLC ( Tatex II ).  Tatex II holds   85,122   of the   1,000,000   outstanding shares of APICO, LLC ( APICO ), an international oil and gas exploration company.  APICO has a reserve base located in Southeast Asia through its ownership of concessions covering approximately   243,000   acres which includes the Phu Horm Field.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company received   $0.4 million   in distributions from Tatex II. 
  Tatex Thailand III, LLC 
  The Company has an ownership interest in Tatex Thailand III, LLC ("Tatex III").  Tatex III previously owned a concession covering approximately   245,000   acres in Southeast Asia.  As of December 31, 2014, the Company reviewed its investment in Tatex III and made the decision to allow the concession to expire in January 2015.  As such, the Company fully impaired the asset as of December 31, 2014.  
  Grizzly Oil Sands ULC 
  The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Grizzly Holdings Inc. ("Grizzly Holdings"), owns an interest in Grizzly Oil Sands ULC ("Grizzly"), a Canadian unlimited liability company.  The remaining interest in Grizzly is owned by Grizzly Oil Sands Inc. ("Oil Sands").  As of   September 30, 2016  , Grizzly had approximately   830,000   acres under lease in the Athabasca and Peace River oil sands regions of Alberta, Canada.  Initiation of steam injection at its first project, Algar Lake Phase 1, commenced in January 2014 and first bitumen production was achieved during the second quarter of 2014.  In April 2015, Grizzly determined to cease bitumen production at its Algar Lake facility due to the level of commodity prices.  Grizzly continues to monitor market conditions as it assesses future plans for the facility.  The Company reviewed its investment in Grizzly at March 31, 2016 for impairment based on FASB ASC 323 due to certain qualitative factors and engaged an independent third party to assist management in determining fair value calculations of its investment.  As a result of the calculated fair values and other qualitative factors, the Company concluded that an other than temporary impairment was required under FASB ASC 323, resulting in an impairment loss of   $23.1 million   for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which is included in (income) loss from equity method investments in the consolidated statements of operations.  As of and during the period ended   September 30, 2016  , commodity prices had increased as compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2016, and there were no impairment indicators that required further evaluation for impairment.  If commodity prices decline in the future, however, further impairment of the investment in Grizzly may be necessary.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Gulfport paid   $14.5 million   in cash calls.  Grizzly s functional currency is the Canadian dollar.  The Company's investment in Grizzly was decreased by   $1.4 million   as a result of a foreign currency translation loss and increased by   $8.3 million   as a result of a foreign currency translation gain for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,

respectively. The Company's investment in Grizzly was decreased by   $11.6 million   and   $23.3 million   as a result of a foreign currency translation loss for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Effective October 5, 2012, Grizzly entered into a   $125.0 million   revolving credit facility, of which Grizzly paid the outstanding balance in full in July 2016. Gulfport paid its share of this amount on June 30, 2016. 
  Timber Wolf Terminals LLC  
  During 2012, the Company invested in Timber Wolf Terminals LLC ( Timber Wolf ).  Timber Wolf was formed to operate a crude/condensate terminal and a sand transloading facility in Ohio.  
  Windsor Midstream LLC 
  During 2012, the Company purchased an ownership interest in Windsor Midstream LLC ( Midstream ).  Midstream owned a   28.4%   interest in Coronado Midstream LLC ("Coronado"), a gas processing plant in West Texas.  In March 2015, Coronado was sold to Enlink Midstream Partners, LP ("EnLink") for proceeds of approximately   $600.0 million  , consisting of cash and units representing a limited partnership interest in Enlink.  Midstream recorded an $  81.6 million   gain on the sale of its investment in Coronado.  The Company received   $14.2 million   in distributions from Midstream during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Stingray Cementing LLC 
  During 2012, the Company invested in Stingray Cementing LLC ("Stingray Cementing").  Stingray Cementing provides well cementing services.  The (income) loss from equity method investments presented in the table above reflects any intercompany profit eliminations. 
  Blackhawk Midstream LLC 
  During 2012, the Company invested in Blackhawk Midstream LLC ("Blackhawk").  Blackhawk was formed to coordinate gathering, compression, processing and marketing activities for the Company in connection with the development of its Utica Shale acreage.  On January 28, 2014, Blackhawk completed the sale of its equity interests in Ohio Gathering Company, LLC and Ohio Condensate Company, LLC for a purchase price of   $190.0 million  , of which   $14.3 million   was placed in escrow.  During the first quarter of 2015, the Company received net proceeds of approximately   $7.2 million   from the release of escrow from the Blackhawk sale, which is included in (income) loss from equity method investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Stingray Energy Services LLC 
  During 2013, the Company invested in Stingray Energy Services LLC ("Stingray Energy").  Stingray Energy provides rental tools for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities as well as the transfer of fresh water to wellsites.  The (income) loss from equity method investments presented in the table above reflects any intercompany profit eliminations.   
  Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC 
  During 2014, the Company invested   $20.7 million   and received an ownership interest of   25%   in Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC ("Sturgeon").  Sturgeon owns and operates sand mines that produce hydraulic fracturing grade sand.  
  Mammoth Energy Partners LP  
  In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company contributed its investments in four entities to Mammoth Energy Partners LP ("Mammoth") for a   30.5%   interest in this entity.  Mammoth originally intended to pursue its initial public offering in 2014 or 2015; however, due to low commodity prices, the offering was postponed.  In October 2016, Mammoth became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. ("Mammoth Energy"), and Mammoth Energy closed its initial public offering (the "IPO"). Upon completion of the IPO, the Company owned   24.2%   of the outstanding common stock of Mammoth Energy.  See Note 16 for further discussion of the initial public offering.  The Company reviewed its investment in Mammoth at   September 30, 2016   and determined no impairment was needed.  If commodity prices decline in the future, an impairment of the investment in Mammoth may result.  The Company's investment in Mammoth was increased by a   $0.2 million   foreign

currency gain and decreased by a   $1.1 million   foreign currency loss resulting from Mammoth's foreign subsidiary for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The (income) loss from equity method investments presented in the table above reflects any intercompany profit eliminations.   
  Strike Force Midstream LLC 
  In February 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Gulfport Midstream Holdings, LLC ("Midstream Holdings"), entered into an agreement with Rice Midstream Holdings LLC ("Rice"), a subsidiary of Rice Energy Inc., to develop natural gas gathering assets in eastern Belmont County and Monroe County, Ohio (the "dedicated areas").  The Company contributed certain gathering assets for a   25%   interest in the newly formed entity called Strike Force Midstream LLC ("Strike Force").  Rice acts as operator and owns the remaining   75%   interest in Strike Force.  Construction of the gathering assets, which is underway, is expected to provide gathering services for Gulfport operated wells and connectivity of existing dry gas gathering systems. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Gulfport paid   $4.0 million   in cash calls to Strike Force. 
  The Company accounted for its contribution to Strike Force at fair value under applicable codification guidance.  The Company estimated the fair market value of its investment in Strike Force as of the contribution date using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach, based on an independently prepared valuation of the contributed assets.  The fair market value was reduced by a discount factor for the lack of marketability due to the Company's minority interest, resulting in a fair value of   $22.5 million   for the Company's   25%   interest.  The fair value of the assets contributed was estimated using assumptions that represent Level 3 inputs.  See "Note 12 - Fair Value Measurements" for additional discussion of the measurement inputs.  The Company has elected to report its proportionate share of Strike Force's earnings on a one-quarter lag as permitted under FASB ASC 323.  The (income) loss from equity method investments presented in the table above reflects any intercompany profit eliminations.   
   
           4. 
    VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company held variable interests in the following variable interest entities ("VIEs"), but was not the primary beneficiary: Mammoth, Stingray Energy, Stingray Cementing, Sturgeon, Midstream and Timber Wolf.  These entities have governing provisions that are the functional equivalent of a limited partnership and are considered VIEs because the limited partners or non-managing members lack substantive kick-out or participating rights which causes the equity owners, as a group, to lack a controlling financial interest.  The Company is a limited partner or non-managing member in each of these VIEs and is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest.  The general partner or managing member has power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs  economic performance.  The Company also held a variable interest in Strike Force due to the fact that it does not have sufficient equity capital at risk.  The Company is not the primary beneficiary of this entity. 
  The Company accounts for its investment in these VIEs following the equity method of accounting.  The carrying amounts of the Company s equity investments are classified as other non-current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  The Company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these VIEs is based on the Company s capital contributions and the economic performance of the VIEs, and is equal to the carrying value of the Company s investments which is the maximum loss the Company could be required to record in the consolidated statements of operations.  See Note 3 for further discussion of these entities, including the carrying amounts of each investment.  
   
           5.

  (1) The Company has entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility, as amended, with The Bank of Nova Scotia, as the lead arranger and administrative agent and certain lenders from time to time party thereto.  The credit agreement provides for a maximum facility amount of   $1.5 billion   and matures on June 6, 2018.  On February 19, 2016, the Company further amended its revolving credit facility to, among other things, (a) increase the basket for unsecured debt issuances to   $1.4 billion   from   $1.2 billion   (of which   $950 million   was then outstanding), (b) reaffirm the Company s borrowing base of   $700.0 million  , and (c) increase the percentage of projected oil and gas production that may be hedged by the Company during 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , no balance was outstanding under this revolving credit facility and total funds available for borrowing, after giving effect to an aggregate of   $207.0 million   of letters of credit, were   $493.0 million  .  This facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets.  The wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company guarantee the obligations under the revolving credit facility. 
  Advances under this revolving credit facility may be in the form of either base rate loans or eurodollar loans.  The interest rate for base rate loans is equal to (1) the applicable rate, which ranges from   0.50%   to   1.50%  , plus (2) the highest of: (a) the federal funds rate plus   0.50%  , (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by agent as its  prime rate,  and (c) the eurodollar rate for an interest period of one month plus   1.00%  .  The interest rate for eurodollar loans is equal to (1) the applicable rate, which ranges from   1.50%   to   2.50%  , plus (2) the London interbank offered rate that appears on pages   LIBOR01   or LIBOR02 of the Reuters screen that displays such rate for deposits in U.S. dollars, or, if such rate is not available, the rate as administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (or any other person that takes over administration of such rate) per annum equal to the offered rate on such other page or other service that displays an average

  The Company's revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Company's and its subsidiaries' ability to: incur indebtedness; grant liens; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; make investments; make fundamental changes; enter into swap contracts and forward sales contracts; dispose of assets; change the nature of their business; and enter into transactions with their affiliates.  The negative covenants are subject to certain exceptions as specified in this revolving credit facility.  The Company's revolving credit facility also contains certain affirmative covenants, including, but not limited to the following financial covenants: (1) the ratio of net funded debt to EBITDAX (net income, excluding (i) any non-cash revenue or expense associated with swap contracts resulting from ASC 815 and (ii) any cash or non-cash revenue or expense attributable to minority investment plus without duplication and, in the case of expenses, to the extent deducted from revenues in determining net income, the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of consolidated interest expense for such period, (b) the aggregate amount of income, franchise, capital or similar tax expense (other than ad valorem taxes) for such period, (c) all amounts attributable to depletion, depreciation, amortization and asset or goodwill impairment or writedown for such period, (d) all other non-cash charges, (e) exploration costs deducted in determining net income under successful efforts accounting, (f) actual cash distributions received from minority investments, (g) to the extent actually reimbursed by insurance, expenses with respect to liability on casualty events or business interruption, and (h) all reasonable transaction expenses related to dispositions and acquisitions of assets, investments and debt and equity offerings (provided that expenses related to any unsuccessful dispositions will be limited to   $3.0 million   in the aggregate) for a twelve-month period may not be greater than   4.00   to 1.00; and (2) the ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense for a twelve-month period may not be less than   3.00   to 1.00.  The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants at   September 30, 2016  .  
  (2)  In March 2011, the Company refinanced the   $2.4 million   then outstanding under its previous building loan for the office building it occupies in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  This loan agreement, as subsequently amended, bore interest at the rate of   4.00%   per annum, required monthly interest and principal payments of approximately   $20,000  , was collateralized by the Oklahoma City office building and associated land and had a maturity date of December 2018.  The Company paid the balance of the loan in full in February 2016. 
  (3) On October 17, 2012, the Company issued   $250.0   million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the "October Notes") under an indenture among the Company, its subsidiary guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the trustee (the "senior note indenture").  On December 21, 2012, the Company issued an additional   $50.0   million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the "December Notes") as additional securities under the senior note indenture.  On August 18, 2014, the Company issued an additional   $300.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the "August Notes").  The August Notes were issued as additional securities under the senior note indenture.  The October Notes, December Notes and the August Notes are collectively referred to as the "2020 Notes." 
  In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, the Company and the subsidiary guarantors entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers, pursuant to which the Company and the subsidiary guarantors agreed to file a registration statement with respect to an offering to exchange the 2020 Notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the Securities Act.  The exchange offer for the October Notes and the December Notes was completed in October 2013 and the exchange offer for the August Note was completed in March 2015. 
   Under the senior note indenture relating to the 2020 Notes, interest on the 2020 Notes accrues at a rate of   7.75%   per annum on the outstanding principal amount from October 17, 2012, payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2013.  The 2020 Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in the right of payment with all of the Company's other senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness.  All of the Company's existing and future restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the Company's secured revolving credit facility or certain other debt guarantee the 2020 Notes; provided, however, that the 2020 Notes are not guaranteed by Grizzly Holdings, Inc. and will not be guaranteed by any of the Company's future unrestricted subsidiaries.  The Company may redeem some or all of the 2020 Notes at any time on or after November 1, 2016, at the redemption prices listed in the senior note indenture.  Prior to November 1, 2016, the Company may redeem the 2020 Notes at a price equal to   100%   of the principal amount plus a  make-whole  premium.  In addition, prior to November 1, 2015, the Company may redeem up to   35%   of the aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings, provided that at least   65%   of the aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes initially issued remains outstanding immediately after such redemption.  See Note 16, Subsequent Events - "Tender Offer and Redemption - Existing 2020 Notes."

(4) On April 21, 2015, the Company issued   $350.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   6.625%   Senior Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Notes" and, together with the "2020 Notes," the "Notes") to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (the "2023 Notes Offering").  The Company received net proceeds of approximately   $343.6 million   after initial purchaser discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. 
  The 2023 notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of April 21, 2015, among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee.  Pursuant to the indenture relating to the 2023 Notes, interest on the 2023 Notes will accrue at a rate of   6.625%   per annum on the outstanding principal amount thereof from April 21, 2015, payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on November 1, 2015.  The 2023 Notes are not guaranteed by Grizzly Holdings, Inc. and will not be guaranteed by any of the Company's future unrestricted subsidiaries. 
  In connection with the 2023 Notes Offering, the Company and its subsidiary guarantors entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of April 21, 2015, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the 2023 Notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the Securities Act.  The exchange offer for the 2023 Notes was completed on October 13, 2015. 
  (5) The October Notes were issued at a price of   98.534%   resulting in a gross discount of   $3.7 million   and an effective rate of   8.000%  .  The December Notes were issued at a price of   101.000%   resulting in a gross premium of   $0.5 million   and an effective rate of   7.531%  .  The August Notes were issued at a price of   106.000%   resulting in a gross premium of   $18.0 million   and an effective rate of   6.561%  .  The April Notes were issued at par.  The premium and discount are being amortized using the effective interest method.  
  (6) In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03, loan issuance costs related to the Notes have been presented as a reduction to the Notes.  At   September 30, 2016  , total unamortized debt issuance costs were   $4.4 million   for the October Notes,   $1.0 million   for the December Notes,   $4.3 million   for the August Notes and   $6.2 million   for the April Notes.  At   September 30, 2016  , total unamortized debt issuance costs were   $0.1 million   for the Construction Loan (as defined below). 
  (7) On June 4, 2015, the Company entered into a construction loan agreement (the "Construction Loan") with InterBank for the construction of a new corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City.  The Construction Loan allows for a maximum principal amount of   $24.5 million   and requires the Company to fund   30%   of the estimated cost of the construction before any funds can be drawn, which occurred in January 2016.  Interest accrues daily on the outstanding principal balance at a fixed rate of   4.50%   per annum and is payable on the last day of the month through May 31, 2017.  Monthly interest and principal payments are due beginning June 30, 2017, with the final payment due June 4, 2025.  At   September 30, 2016  , the total borrowings under the Construction Loan were approximately   $16.5 million  .

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
     Plugging and Abandonment Funds 
  In connection with the Company's acquisition in 1997 of the remaining   50%   interest in its WCBB properties, the Company assumed the seller s (Chevron) obligation to contribute approximately   $18,000   per month through March 2004 to a plugging and abandonment trust and the obligation to plug a minimum of   20   wells per year for   20   years commencing March 11, 1997.  Chevron retained a security interest in production from these properties until the Company's abandonment obligations to Chevron have been fulfilled.  Beginning in 2009, the Company could access the trust for use in plugging and abandonment charges associated with the property, although it has not yet done so.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the plugging and abandonment trust totaled approximately   $3.1 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had plugged   483   wells at WCBB since it began its plugging program in 1997, which management believes fulfills its current minimum plugging obligation. 
  Operating Leases      
  The Company leases office facilities under non-cancellable operating leases exceeding one year. Future minimum lease commitments under these leases at   September 30, 2016   were as follows:  

Other Commitments 
  Effective October 1, 2014 and subsequently amended on November 3, 2015, the Company entered into a Sand Supply Agreement with Muskie Proppant LLC ("Muskie") that expires on September 30, 2018.  Pursuant to this agreement, the Company has agreed to purchase annual and monthly amounts of proppant sand subject to exceptions specified in the agreement at agreed pricing, plus agreed costs and expenses.  Failure by either Muskie or the Company to deliver or accept the minimum monthly amount results in damages calculated per ton based on the difference between the monthly obligation amount and the amount actually delivered or accepted, as applicable.  The Company incurred   $0.2 million   and   $2.1 million   related to non-utilization fees during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  Effective October 1, 2014, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement for pressure pumping services with Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC ("Stingray Pressure") that expires on September 30, 2018.  Pursuant to this agreement, Stingray Pressure has agreed to provide hydraulic fracturing, stimulation and related completion and rework services to the Company and the Company has agreed to pay Stingray Pressure a monthly service fee plus the associated costs of the services provided.  On February 18, 2016, effective January 1, 2016, the Company amended its Master Services Agreement with Stingray Pressure.  The amendment adjusted the amount of service fees payable for the period from January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016. 
  Future minimum commitments under these agreements at   September 30, 2016   are as follows:    

  Litigation  
  In   two   separate complaints, one filed by the State of Louisiana and the Parish of Cameron in the 38th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Cameron on February 9, 2016 and the other filed by the State of Louisiana and the District Attorney for

     Table of Contents  

the 15   th    Judicial District of the State of Louisiana in the 15   th    Judicial District Court for the Parish of Vermillion on July 29, 2016, the Company was named as a defendant, among   26   oil and gas companies, in the Cameron Parish complaint and among more than   40   oil and gas companies in the Vermillion Parish complaint (the "Complaints").  The Complaints were filed under the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended, and the rules, regulations, orders and ordinances adopted thereunder, which the Company referred to collectively as the CZM Laws, and allege that certain of the defendants  oil and gas exploration, production and transportation operations associated with the development of the East Hackberry and West Hackberry oil and gas fields, in the case of the Cameron Parish complaint, and the Tigre Lagoon oil and gas field, in the case of the Vermillion Parish complaint, were conducted in violation of the CZM Laws.  The Complaints allege that such activities caused substantial damage to land and waterbodies located in the coastal zone of the relevant Parish, including due to defendants  design, construction and use of waste pits and the alleged failure to properly close the waste pits and to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify and return the property affected to its original condition, as well as the defendants  alleged discharge of waste into the coastal zone.  The Complaints also allege that the defendants  oil and gas activities have resulted in the dredging of numerous canals, which had a direct and significant impact on the state coastal waters within the relevant Parish and that the defendants, among other things, failed to design, construct and maintain these canals using the best practical techniques to prevent bank slumping, erosion and saltwater intrusion and to minimize the potential for inland movement of storm-generated surges, which activities allegedly have resulted in the erosion of marshes and the degradation of terrestrial and aquatic life therein.  The Complaints also allege that the defendants failed to re-vegetate, refill, clean, detoxify and otherwise restore these canals to their original condition.  In these two petitions, the plaintiffs seek damages and other appropriate relief under the CZM Laws, including the payment of costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify and otherwise restore the affected coastal zone of the relevant Parish to its original condition, actual restoration of such coastal zone to its original condition, and the payment of reasonable attorney fees and legal expenses and pre-judgment and post judgment interest. 
  The Company was served with the Cameron complaint in early May 2016 and with the Vermillion complaint in early September 2016.  The Louisiana Attorney General and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources intervened in both the Cameron Parish suit and the Vermillion Parish suit.  Shortly after the Complaints were filed, certain defendants removed the cases to the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.  In both cases, the plaintiffs have filed a motion to remand, but both Courts have stayed further proceedings on the motions to remand pending a ruling from the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit on similar jurisdictional issues in another matter.  The plaintiffs have granted all defendants an extension of time to file responsive pleadings to the Complaints until the District Courts rule on the motions to remand. The Company has not had the opportunity to evaluate the applicability of the allegations made in such complaints to their operations.  Due to the early stages of these matters, management cannot determine the amount of loss, if any, that may result. 
  In addition, due to the nature of the Company's business, it is, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to its business activities, including workers' compensation claims and employment related disputes.  In the opinion of the Company's management, none of the pending litigation, disputes or claims against the Company, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 
   
           11. 
    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
     Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Derivative Instruments 
  The Company seeks to reduce its exposure to unfavorable changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which are subject to significant and often volatile fluctuation, by entering into fixed over-the-counter fixed price swaps, basis swaps and various types of option contracts.  These contracts allow the Company to predict with greater certainty the effective oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices to be received for hedged production and benefit operating cash flows and earnings when market prices are less than the fixed prices provided in the contracts.  However, the Company will not benefit from market prices that are higher than the fixed prices in the contracts for hedged production. 
   Fixed price swaps are settled monthly based on differences between the fixed price specified in the contract and the referenced settlement price.  When the referenced settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract, the Company receives an amount from the counterparty based on the price difference multiplied by the volume.  Similarly, when the referenced settlement price exceeds the price specified in the contract, the Company pays the counterparty an amount based on the price difference multiplied by the volume.  The prices contained in these fixed price swaps are based on Argus Louisiana Light Sweet Crude for oil, the NYMEX Henry Hub for natural gas and Mont Belvieu for propane.  Below is a summary of the Company's open fixed price swap positions as of   September 30, 2016  .    
  
   19 

The Company sold call options and used the associated premiums to enhance the fixed price for a portion of the fixed price natural gas swaps listed above.  Each short call option has an established ceiling price.  When the referenced settlement price is above the price ceiling established by these short call options, the Company pays its counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the referenced settlement price and the price ceiling multiplied by the hedged contract volume. 

For a portion of the combined natural gas derivative instruments containing fixed price swaps and sold call options, the counterparty has an option to extend the original terms an additional   twelve   months for the period January 2017 through December 2017.  The option to extend the terms expires in December 2016.  If executed, the Company would have additional fixed price swaps for   30,000   MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of   $3.33   per MMBtu and additional short call options for   30,000   MMBtu per day at a weighted average ceiling price of   $3.33   per MMBtu. 
  In addition, the Company has entered into natural gas basis swap positions, which settle on the pricing index to basis differential of MichCon or Tetco M2 to the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the following natural gas basis swap positions for MichCon and Tetco M2, respectively. 

Balance Sheet Presentation 
  The Company reports the fair value of derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as derivative instruments under current assets, noncurrent assets, current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities on a gross basis.  The Company determines  
  
   20 

the current and noncurrent classification based on the timing of expected future cash flows of individual trades.  The following table presents the fair value of the Company's derivative instruments on a gross basis at   September 30, 2016  : 

Gains and Losses 
  For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and meeting the effectiveness guidelines of FASB ASC 815, changes in fair value are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The Company has no cash flow hedges in place for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as all fixed price swaps, swaptions and basis swaps had either been deemed ineffective at their inception or had been accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method.  
  The following table presents the net gain and loss recognized in gas sales, oil and condensate sales and natural gas liquids sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   

  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  By using derivative instruments that are not traded on an exchange, the Company is exposed to the credit risk of its counterparties.  Credit risk is the risk of loss from counterparties not performing under the terms of the derivative instrument.  When the fair value of a derivative instrument is positive, the counterparty is expected to owe the Company, which creates credit risk.  To minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments, it is the Company's policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers.  The Company's derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to lessen its exposure to any individual counterparty.  Additionally, the Company uses master netting agreements to minimize credit risk exposure.  The creditworthiness of the Company's counterparties is subject to periodic review.  Other than as provided by the Company's revolving credit facility, the Company is not required to provide credit support or collateral to any of its counterparties under its derivative instruments, nor are the counterparties required to provide credit support to the Company. 
   
           12. 
    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
     The Company records certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 820,   "Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures"   ("FASB ASC 820").  FASB ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The statement establishes market or observable inputs as the preferred sources of values, followed by assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs.  The statement requires fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: 
  Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
  
   21 

     Table of Contents  

Level 2   Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
  Level 3   Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable. 
  Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored.  Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy.  Reclassifications of fair value between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, if applicable, are made at the end of each quarter. 
  The following tables summarize the Company s financial and non-financial assets and liabilities by FASB ASC 820 valuation level as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The Company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments industry-standard models that considered various assumptions including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, implied volatility, time value, nonperformance risk, as well as other relevant economic measures.  Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be supported by observable data. 
  The estimated fair values of proved oil and gas properties assumed in business combinations are based on a discounted cash flow model and market assumptions as to future commodity prices, projections of estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, expectations for timing and amount of future development and operating costs, projections of future rates of production, expected recovery rates and risk-adjusted discount rates.  The estimated fair values of unevaluated oil and gas properties was based on geological studies, historical well performance, location and applicable mineral lease terms.  Based on the unobservable nature of certain of the inputs, the estimated fair value of the oil and gas properties assumed is deemed to use Level 3 inputs.  See Note 1 for further discussion of the Company's acquisitions.  
  The Company estimates asset retirement obligations pursuant to the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 410,   Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations   ( FASB ASC 410 ).  The initial measurement of asset retirement obligations at fair value is calculated using discounted cash flow techniques and based on internal estimates of future retirement costs associated with oil and gas properties.  Given the unobservable nature of the inputs, including plugging costs and reserve lives, the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation liability is deemed to use Level 3 inputs.  See Note 2 for further discussion of the Company s asset retirement obligations.  Asset retirement obligations incurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were approximately   $6.7 million  . 
  Due to the unobservable nature of the inputs, the fair value of the Company's investment in Grizzly was estimated using assumptions that represent Level 3 inputs.  The Company estimated the fair value of the investment as of March 31, 2016 to be approximately   $39.1 million  .  See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's investment in Grizzly. 
  Due to the unobservable nature of the inputs, the fair value of the Company's investment in Strike Force was estimated using assumptions that represent Level 3 inputs.

    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
     In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , and most industry-specific guidance.  The core principle of the new standard is for the recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the payment to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard will also result in enhanced revenue disclosures, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements.  The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, using either a full or a modified retrospective application approach.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date by one year (until 2018).  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40).        The new guidance addresses management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and in certain circumstances to provide related footnote disclosures.  The standard is effective for periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysi  s.  This ASU provides additional guidance to reporting entities in evaluating whether certain legal entities, such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporation and securitization structure, should be consolidated.  The ASU is considered to be an improvement on current accounting requirements as it reduces the number of existing consolidation models.  The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2016 and is required to be adopted using a retrospective or modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2016.  As a result, certain of the Company's equity investments were determined to be variable interest entites; however, the Company was not required to consolidate these investments. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  .  To simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  This guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted this guidance effective December 31, 2015, and has reclassified   $16.0 million   and   $17.9 million   of debt issuance costs to offset long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as shown in Note 6. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.    The guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated.  Measurement period adjustments are calculated as if they were known at the acquisition date, but are recognized in the reporting period in which they are determined.  Additional disclosures are required about the impact on current-period income statement line items of adjustments that would have been recognized in prior periods if the prior-period information had been revised.  The guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 and there was no impact to its consolidated financial statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 705)  . Current guidance requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference.  To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred income tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.  This guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  .  The guidance requires the lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet thereby resulting in the recognition of lease assets and liability for those leases currently classified as operating leases.  The accounting for lessors is largely unchanged.  The guidance is effective for periods after December 15,  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

2018, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,   Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.    The guidance was issued to clarify that change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that had been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815, does not require designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  This guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.  The Company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements because all current derivative instruments are not designated for hedge accounting. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Equity Method and Joint Ventures.    This guidance simplified current requirements by eliminating the need to retrospectively apply the equity method of accounting upon obtaining significant influence over an investment that it previously accounted for under the cost basis or at fair value.  This guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.  The Company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements because all current investments are accounted under the equity method investment. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This guidance was intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  This guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging: Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting.    This guidance rescinds SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified in Topic 606, Revenue Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities--Oil and Gas.  This amendment is effective upon adoption of Topic 606.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    This guidance provides guidance of eight specific cash flow issues. This amendment is effective for periods after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

6.000% Senior Notes due 2024 
  On October 14, 2016, the Company issued   $650.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of    6.000%    Senior Notes due 2024 (the  2024 Notes ).  The 2024 Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of October 14, 2016, among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as the trustee (the  Indenture ), to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and to certain non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (the  2024 Notes Offering ).  Under the Indenture, interest on the 2024 Notes accrues at a rate of   6.000%   per annum on the outstanding principal amount thereof from October 14, 2016, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2017.  The 2024 Notes will mature on October 15, 2024.  The Company received approximately   $640.0 million   in net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Notes, which was used, together with cash on hand, to purchase the outstanding 2020 Notes in a concurrent cash tender offer, to pay fees and expenses thereof, and to redeem any of the 2020 Notes that remained outstanding after the completion of the tender offer.  For a discussion of the tender offer and related redemption, see  -Tender Offer and Redemption-Existing 2020 Notes.  
  Tender Offer and Redemption-Existing 2020 Notes 
  On October 6, 2016, the Company commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of its 2020 Notes, which tender offer expired on October 13, 2016 and settled on October 14, 2016.  Holders of the 2020 Notes that were validly tendered and accepted at or prior to the expiration time of the tender offer, or who delivered the 2020 Notes pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures, received total cash consideration of $  1,042   per $  1,000   principal amount of notes, plus any accrued and  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

unpaid interest up to, but not including, the settlement date.  An aggregate of   $403.5 million   in principal amount of the 2020 Notes was validly tendered in the tender offer.  The remaining 2020 Notes that were not tendered in the tender offer were redeemed by the Company.  The redemption payment included approximately   $196.5 million   in aggregate principal amount at a redemption price of     103.875%     of the principal amount of the redeemed 2020 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.  Upon deposit of the redemption payment with the paying agent on October 14, 2016, the indenture governing the 2020 Notes was fully satisfied and discharged.  The cash tender offer for the 2020 Notes and redemption of the remaining 2020 Notes were funded with the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Notes (discussed in more detail above) and cash on hand. 
  Derivatives  
  In October 2016, the Company entered into fixed price swaps for the period from January 2017 through June 2017, for   20,000   MMBtu of natural gas per day at a weighted average price of $  3.19   per MMBtu.  For the period from July 2017 through October 2017, the Company entered into fixed price swaps for   40,000   MMBtu of natural gas per day at a weighted average price of $  3.15   per MMBtu.

The Company's fixed price swap contracts are tied to the commodity prices on NYMEX.  The Company will receive the fixed price amount stated in the contract and pay to its counterparty the current market price as listed on NYMEX for natural gas. 
  Mammoth Energy Initial Public Offering 
  On October 19, 2016, Mammoth Energy closed its IPO of   7,750,000   shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $  15.00   per share, of which   7,500,000   shares were sold by Mammoth Energy and   250,000   shares were sold by certain selling stockholders, including   76,250   shares sold by the Company for which it received net proceeds of   $1.1 million  .

  Overview  
  We are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company focused on the exploration, exploitation, acquisition and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids in the United States.  Our corporate strategy is to internally identify prospects, acquire lands encompassing those prospects and evaluate those prospects using subsurface geology and geophysical data and exploratory drilling.  Using this strategy, we have developed an oil and natural gas portfolio of proved reserves, as well as development and exploratory drilling opportunities on high potential conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas prospects.  Our principal properties are located in the Utica Shale in Eastern Ohio and along the Louisiana Gulf Coast in the West Cote Blanche Bay, or WCBB, and Hackberry fields.  In addition, we have producing properties in the Niobrara Formation of Northwestern Colorado and the Bakken Formation.  We also hold a significant acreage position in the Alberta oil sands in Canada through our interest in Grizzly Oil Sands ULC, or Grizzly, and an interest in an entity that operates in Southeast Asia, including the Phu Horm gas field in Thailand.  We seek to achieve reserve growth and increase our cash flow through our annual drilling programs. 
  Strong results from our existing production base and efficiencies realized in our completion activities resulted in our achieving 2015 production above expectations.  Based on these strong results and efficiencies, and taking into consideration the continued weakness in natural gas commodity pricing, we idled completion crews and suspended our hydraulic fracturing activities during the first quarter of 2016, and entered into an agreement with one of our service providers that adjusted the amount of service fees that would otherwise be payable during this period.  We resumed these activities on April 1, 2016.  As a result of these suspended activities, our average daily production during the second quarter of 2016 was slightly below our production in the first quarter of 2016 due to normal production declines from existing wells and the timing of our wells turned-to-sales in 2016.  Our renewed completion activities were recognized in the third quarter of 2016, with our average net daily production increasing 10% from the second quarter 2016.  In addition, we began experiencing higher than anticipated gathering line pressures in an isolated portion of our dry gas development area of the play in the first half of 2016 which is having a near-term effect on our production levels.  We, along with our third-party midstream providers, have developed a long-term, multi-phase compression plan for the optimization of our gathering systems and have begun implementing this plan.  We installed pad level compression on a select group of wells during the third quarter and achieved the expected improvements resulting from th 
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

e targeted pressure drop within the isolated area.  In addition, we currently expect to have field level compression online around year-end 2016.   
   
  2016 Operational Highlights  
              
    During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we spud   nine   gross (  8.8   net) wells in the Utica Shale, participated in an additional   eight   gross (  1.7   net) wells that were drilled by other operators on our Utica Shale acreage and recompleted 24 gross and net wells on our Louisiana acreage.  Of our   nine   new wells spud at   September 30, 2016  , six were in various stages of completion, and three were being drilled.  In addition, we turned-to-sales 21 gross (15.8 net) operated wells and 13 gross (3.9 net) non-operated wells during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

2016 Production and Drilling Activity 
    During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our total net production was   58,150,669   thousand cubic feet, or Mcf, of natural gas,   521,356   barrels of oil and   43,837,087   gallons of NGLs for a total of   67,541   MMcfe, as compared to   48,123,538   Mcf of natural gas,   732,133   barrels of oil and   49,093,606   gallons of NGLs, or   59,530   MMcfe, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our total net production averaged approximately   734.1   MMcfe per day during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   647.1   MMcfe per day during the same period in   2015  .  The   13%     increase   in production is largely the result of the continuing development of our Utica Shale acreage. 
  Utica Shale  . As of   October 28, 2016  , we held leasehold interests in approximately 222,000 gross (211,000 net) acres in the Utica Shale.

In addition,   20   gross (  3.1   net) wells were drilled by other operators on our Utica Shale acreage during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   October 28, 2016  , we had four rigs under contract on our Utica Shale acreage and have contracted a fifth and sixth rig to begin operations in November 2016 and December 2016, respectively.  We currently intend to spud 42 to 46 gross (36 to 39 net) wells on our Utica Shale acreage in 2016.  
    Aggregate net production from our Utica Shale acreage during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   65,599   MMcfe, or an average of   713.0   MMcfe per day,   89%   of which was from natural gas and   11%   of which was from oil and NGLs.  
  WCBB  . From January 1, 2016 through   October 28, 2016  , we recompleted 48 wells and spud no new wells.  Aggregate net production from the WCBB field during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   1,451   MMcfe, or an average of   15.8   MMcfe per day,   100%   of which was from oil.  
  East Hackberry Field  . From January 1, 2016 through   October 28, 2016  , we recompleted 19 wells and spud no new wells.  Aggregate net production from the East Hackberry field during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   350   MMcfe, or an average of   3.8   MMcfe per day,   99%   of which was from oil and   1%   of which was from natural gas.  
  West Hackberry Field  . From January 1, 2016 through   October 28, 2016  , we did not spud any wells in our West Hackberry field.  Aggregate net production from the West Hackberry field during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was

As of   September 30, 2016  , we held approximately 778 net acres in the Bakken Formation of Western North Dakota and Eastern Montana with interests in 18 wells and overriding royalty interests in certain existing and future wells.  Aggregate net production from this acreage during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately   60   MMcfe, or an average of   655.7   Mcfe per day, of which   85%   was from oil,   12%   was from natural gas and   3%   was from NGLs.  
   
  2016 Updates Regarding Our Equity Investments 
  Mammoth Energy Initial Public Offering  . On October 19, 2016, Mammoth Energy Services, Inc., or Mammoth Energy,  closed its initial public offering, or the IPO, of 7,750,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, of which 7,500,000 shares were sold by Mammoth Energy and 250,000 shares were sold by certain selling stockholders, including 76,250 shares sold by us for which we received net proceeds of $1.1 million.  Prior to the completion of the IPO, we were issued 9,150,000 shares of Mammoth Energy common stock in return for the contribution of our 30.5% interest in Mammoth.  The underwriters have an option, exercisable within 30-days after the IPO, to purchase at the same price per share up to an additional 1,162,500 shares of Mammoth Energy common stock from the selling stockholders, including up to 354,563 shares of common stock from us.  We intend to use the net proceeds for the sale of our Mammoth Energy shares in the IPO for general corporate purposes.  Following the IPO, we owned an approximate 24.2% interest in Mammoth Energy. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  Our disc  ussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP.  The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  We have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management.  We analyze our estimates including those related to oil and natural gas properties, revenue recognition, income taxes and commitments and contingencies, and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:  
  Oil and Natural Gas Properties  .  We use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations. Accordingly, all costs, including non-productive costs and certain general and administrative costs directly associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, are capitalized.  Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter.  The test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of the oil and gas properties.  Net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling.  The cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of (a) estimated future net revenues, discounted at 10% per annum, from proved reserves, based on the 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the prior twelve months, adjusted for any contract provisions or financial derivatives, if any, that hedge our oil and natural gas revenue, and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet, (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, if any, and (c) the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized, including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties.  If the net book value, including related deferred taxes, exceeds the ceiling, an impairment or noncash writedown is required.  Such capitalized costs, including the estimated future development costs and site remediation costs of proved undeveloped properties are depleted by an equivalent units-of-production method, converting gas to barrels at the ratio of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil.  No gain or loss is recognized upon the disposal of oil and natural gas properties, unless such dispositions significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proven oil and natural gas reserves.  Oil and natural gas properties not subject to amortization consist of the cost of undeveloped leaseholds and totaled approximately   $1.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $1.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  These costs are reviewed quarterly by management for impairment, with the impairment provision included in the cost of oil and natural gas properties subject to amortization.  Factors considered by management in its impairment assessment include our drilling results and those

     Table of Contents  

of other operators, the terms of oil and natural gas leases not held by production and available funds for exploration and development.  
  Ceiling Test  .  Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter.  The test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of the oil and gas properties.  Net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling (as defined in the preceding paragraph).  If the net book value, including related deferred taxes, exceeds the ceiling, an impairment or noncash writedown is required.  Ceiling test impairment can give us a significant loss for a particular period; however, future depletion expense would be reduced.  A decline in oil and gas prices may result in an impairment of oil and gas properties.  As a result of the decline in commodity prices, we recognized a ceiling test impairment of   $601.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  If prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids decline, we may be required to further write down the value of our oil and natural gas properties, which could negatively affect our results of operations.  
  Asset Retirement Obligations  .  We have obligations to remove equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations.  Our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and associated production facilities.  
  We account for abandonment and restoration liabilities under FASB ASC 410 which requires us to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset.  The asset retirement liability is recorded in the period in which the obligation meets the definition of a liability, which is generally when the asset is placed into service.  When the liability is initially recorded, we increase the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by an amount equal to the original liability.  The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related long-lived asset. Upon settlement of the liability or the sale of the well, the liability is reversed.  These liability amounts may change because of changes in asset lives, estimated costs of abandonment or legal or statutory remediation requirements.  
  The fair value of the liability associated with these retirement obligations is determined using significant assumptions, including current estimates of the plugging and abandonment or retirement, annual inflations of these costs, the productive life of the asset and our risk adjusted cost to settle such obligations discounted using our credit adjustment risk free interest rate.  Changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation.  Revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, resulting in prospective changes to depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount.  Because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of most of our oil and natural gas assets, the costs to ultimately retire these assets may vary significantly from previous estimates.  
  Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities  .  Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters.  Netherland, Sewell   Associates, Inc. and to a lesser extent our personnel have prepared reserve reports of our reserve estimates at   December 31, 2015   on a well-by-well basis for our properties.  
  Reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations.  As a result, adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates.  Our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates have been prepared in accordance with the guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  The accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following:  
             
    the quality and quantity of available data;  
                
    the interpretation of that data;  
                
    the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and  
                
    the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates.  
     Our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions, all of which could deviate significantly from actual results.  Therefore, reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of oil and natural gas eventually recovered.

Income Taxes  .  We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income during the period the rate change is enacted.  Deferred tax assets are recognized in the year in which realization becomes determinable.  Periodically, management performs a forecast of its taxable income to determine whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is needed, looking at both positive and negative factors.  A valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is established, if in management's opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion will not be realized.  At   September 30, 2016  , a valuation allowance of   $559.1 million   had been established for the net deferred tax asset, with the exception of certain state NOL's and alternative minimum tax, or AMT, credits that we expect to utilize based on the positive evidence these assets may be realized.  
     Revenue Recognition  .  We derive almost all of our revenue from the sale of crude oil and natural gas produced from our oil and gas properties.  Revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser.  We receive payment on substantially all of these sales from one to three months after delivery.  At the end of each month, we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers that month and the price we will receive.  Variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment received for all prior months are recorded at the end of the quarter after payment is received.  Historically, our actual payments have not significantly deviated from our accruals.  
  Investments Equity Method.    Investments in entities greater than 20% and less than 50%  and/or investments in which we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.  Under the equity method, our share of investees  earnings or loss is recognized in the statement of operations.  
  We review our investments to determine if a loss in value which is other than a temporary decline has occurred.  If such loss has occurred, we recognize an impairment provision.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized an impairment loss related to our investment in Grizzly of approximately   $23.1 million  , all of which was recorded in the first quarter of 2016.  
  Commitments and Contingencies  .  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  We are involved in certain litigation for which the outcome is uncertain.  Changes in the certainty and the ability to reasonably estimate a loss amount, if any, may result in the recognition and subsequent payment of legal liabilities.  
  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  .  We seek to reduce our exposure to unfavorable changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which are subject to significant and often volatile fluctuation, by entering into over-the-counter fixed price swaps, basis swaps and various types of option contracts.  We follow the provisions of FASB ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , as amended.  It requires that all derivative instruments be recognized as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, measured at fair value.  We estimate the fair value of all derivative instruments using industry-standard models that considered various assumptions including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, implied volatility, time value and nonperformance risk, as well as other relevant economic measures.  
  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  While we have historically designated derivative instruments as accounting hedges, effective January 1, 2015, we discontinued hedge accounting prospectively.  Our current commodity derivative instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  Accordingly, the changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change.  Gains and losses on derivatives are included in cash flows from operating activities.  
  See Item 3. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for a summary of our derivative instruments in place as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
  Comparison of the Three Months Ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015    
  We reported a net loss of   $157.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to net loss of   $388.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This   $230.9 million     decrease   in period-to-period net loss was due primarily to a   $382.6 million   decrease of impairment of oil and gas properties and a   $28.0 million     decrease   in depreciation,

depletion and amortization expense, partially offset by a   $36.7 million     decrease   in oil and gas revenues and a   $3.3 million     increase   in midstream gathering and processing expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Oil and Gas Revenues  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we reported oil and natural gas revenues of   $193.7 million   as compared to oil and natural gas revenues of   $230.4 million   during the same period in   2015  .  This   $36.7 million  , or   16%  ,   decrease   in revenues was primarily attributable to the following:  
             
    A $56.5 million decrease in oil and natural gas sales due to an unfavorable change in gains and losses from derivative instruments.  Of the total change, $16.7 million was due to an unfavorable change in settlements related to our derivative positions.  In addition, $39.8 million was due to unfavorable changes in the fair value of our open derivative positions in each period.  

A $22.5 million increase in gas sales without the impact of derivatives due to a   21%   increase in gas sales volumes and a 1% increase in natural gas market prices.  

A $7.9 million decrease in oil and condensate sales without the impact of derivatives due to a   29%   decrease in oil and condensate sales volumes, partially offset by a 3% increase in oil and condensate market prices. 

A $5.2 million increase in natural gas liquids sales without the impact of derivatives due to a 73% increase in natural gas liquids market prices, partially offset by an   11%   decrease in natural gas liquids sales volumes.

Lease Operating Expenses  . Lease operating expenses, or LOE, not including production taxes   decrease  d to   $17.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $17.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This   decrease   was mainly the result of a decrease in expenses related to contract labor, disposal costs and facility repairs and maintenance, partially offset by increases in ad valorem taxes, compressor expense, overhead and water hauling expenses.  
    
  Production Taxes  . Production taxes   decrease  d   $0.1 million   to   $3.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $3.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This   decrease   was related to changes in our product mix and production location as well as a decrease in realized prices. 
  Midstream Gathering and Processing Expenses  . Midstream gathering and processing expenses   increase  d   $3.3 million   to   $45.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $42.2 million   for the same period in   2015  .  This   increase   was primarily attributable to midstream expenses related to our increased production volumes in the Utica Shale resulting from our 2015 and 2016 drilling activities.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization  . Depreciation, depletion and amortization, or DD A, expense   decrease  d to   $62.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and consisted of   $61.6 million   in depletion of oil and natural gas properties and   $0.7 million   in depreciation of other property and equipment, as compared to total DD A expense of   $90.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This   decrease   was due to a decrease in our full cost pool as a result of our 2015 and 2016 ceiling test impairments, partially offset by an decrease in our total proved reserves volume used to calculate our total DD A expense and an increase in our production.  
  General and Administrative Expenses  . Net general and administrative expenses   decrease  d to   $10.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $11.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   $0.5 million     decrease   was due to a decrease in employee stock compensation expense, partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits, bank fees, legal fees, accounting fees and consulting fees. 
  Accretion Expense  . Accretion expense remained relatively flat at   $0.3 million   and   $0.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Interest Expense  . Interest expense   decrease  d to   $12.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $14.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   due primarily to an   increase   in the amount of interest capitalized during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015.  We capitalized approximately   $4.7 million   and   $3.6 million   in interest expense to undeveloped oil and natural gas properties during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  This   increase   in capitalized interest in the   2016   period was the result of changes to our development plan for our oil and natural gas properties.   
  Income Taxes  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately   $138.0 million  , in addition to numerous temporary differences, which gave rise to a net deferred tax asset.  Periodically, management performs a forecast of our taxable income to determine whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is needed, looking at both positive and negative factors.  A valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is established if, in management's opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion will not be realized.  At   September 30, 2016  , a valuation allowance of   $559.1 million   had been provided against the net deferred tax asset, with the exception of certain state net operating losses and AMT credits that we expect to be able to utilize with net operating loss carrybacks and tax planning in the amount of   $4.2 million  .  We recognized an income tax benefit of   $3.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Comparison of the   Nine Months Ended     September 30,     2016   and   2015 
  We reported a net loss of   $739.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to a net loss of   $394.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This   $345.3 million   increase in period-to-period net loss was due primarily to a   $196.3 million     decrease   in oil and gas revenues, a   $213.2 million   decrease in income tax benefit, a   $22.0 million   increase in midstream gathering and processing expenses, a   $7.0 million   increase in impairment of oil and gas properties and a   $10.0 million     increase   in interest expense, partially offset by a   $68.0 million     decrease   in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Oil and Gas Revenues  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we reported oil and natural gas revenues of   $322.5 million   as compared to oil and natural gas revenues of   $518.8 million   during the same period in   2015  .  This   $196.3 million  , or   38%  ,   decrease   in revenues was primarily attributable to the following: 
             
    A $176.2 million decrease in oil and natural gas revenues due to an unfavorable change in gains and losses from derivative instruments.  Of the total change, $242.9 million was due to an unfavorable change in the fair value of our open derivative positions in each period.  This amount was offset by a favorable change of $66.7 million due to a favorable change in settlements related to our derivative positions. 

A $26.4 million increase in gas sales without the impact of derivatives due to a   53%   increase in gas sales volumes largely offset by a 28% decrease in natural gas market prices.  

A $37.3 million decrease in oil and condensate sales without the impact of derivatives due to a   25%   decrease in oil and condensate sales volumes and an 18% decrease in oil and condensate market prices. 

A $9.2 million decrease in natural gas liquid sales without the impact of derivatives due to an   18%   decrease in natural gas liquids sales volumes and a 5% decrease in natural gas liquid market prices.

Midstream Gathering and Processing Expenses  . Midstream gathering and processing expenses   increase  d by   $22.0 million   to   $122.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $100.5 million   for the same period in   2015  .  This   increase   was primarily attributable to midstream expenses related to our increased production volumes in the Utica Shale resulting from our 2015 and 2016 drilling activities. 
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization  . Depreciation, depletion and amortization, or DD A, expense   decrease  d to   $183.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and consisted of   $181.4 million   in depletion of oil and natural gas properties and   $2.0 million   in depreciation of other property and equipment, as compared to total DD A expense of   $251.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This   decrease   was due to a decrease in our full cost pool as a result of our 2015 and 2016 ceiling test impairments, partially offset by a decrease in our total proved reserves volume used to calculate our total DD A expense and an increase in our production.  
  General and Administrative Expenses  . Net general and administrative expenses   increase  d to   $32.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $31.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This   $1.6 million     increase   was due to an increase in consulting fees, salaries and related employee benefits, bank fees, accounting fees, legal fees, computer support expenses and franchise taxes, partially offset by a decrease in employee stock compensation expense.  
  Accretion Expense  . Accretion expense was   $0.8 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  Interest Expense  . Interest expense   increase  d to   $44.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $34.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due partially to the issuance of $350.0 million of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023 on April 21, 2015.  This   increase   is partially offset by total weighted debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility of   $62.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   as compared to no debt outstanding under such facility for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Additionally, we capitalized approximately   $7.7 million   and   $12.0 million   in interest expense to undeveloped oil and natural gas properties during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  This   decrease   in capitalized interest in the   2016   period was the result of changes to our development plan for our oil and natural gas properties.  Additionally, we capitalized approximately   $1.2 million   in interest expense related to our construction loan during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Income Taxes  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately   $138.0 million  , in addition to numerous temporary differences, which gave rise to a net deferred tax asset.  Periodically, management performs a forecast of our taxable income to determine whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is needed, looking at both positive and negative factors.  A valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is established if, in management's opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion will not be realized.  At   September 30, 2016  , a valuation allowance of   $559.1 million   had been provided against the net deferred tax asset, with the exception of certain state net operating losses and AMT credits that we expect to be able to utilize with net operating loss carrybacks and tax planning in the amount of   $4.2 million  .  We recognized an income tax benefit of   $3.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  Overview  .    
  Historically, our primary sources of funds have been cash flow from our producing oil and natural gas properties, borrowings under our credit facility and the issuances of equity and debt securities.  Our ability to access any of these sources of funds can be significantly impacted by decreases in oil and natural gas prices or oil and natural gas production.  During 2015, we received net proceeds of approximately $343.6 million from the sale of our 6.625% Senior Notes due 2023 issued in April 2015.  In addition, we received an aggregate of $981.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in underwritten public offerings completed in April and June 2015.  
  On March 15, 2016, we issued 16,905,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering (which included 2,205,000 shares sold pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares of our common stock granted by the us to, and exercised in full by, the underwriters).  The net proceeds from this equity offering were approximately $411.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.  We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering primarily to fund a portion of our 2017 capital development plan and for general corporate purposes. 
   Net cash flow provided by operating activities was   $245.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to net cash flow provided by operating activities of   $235.1 million   for the same period in   2015  .  This   increase   was

     Table of Contents  

primarily the result of an increase in cash receipts from our oil and natural gas purchasers due to a   10%     increase   in net revenues after giving effect to settled derivative instruments, partially offset by an increase in our operating expenses.  
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $420.3 million   as compared to $  1.4 billion   for the same period in   2015  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we spent   $441.1 million   in additions to oil and natural gas properties, of which $220.7 million was spent on our 2016 drilling, completion and recompletion activities, $96.3 million was spent on expenses attributable to wells spud, completed and recompleted during 2015, $4.2 million was spent on facility enhancements, $53.4 million was spent on lease related costs, primarily the acquisition of leases in the Utica Shale, with the remainder attributable mainly to future location development and capitalized general and administrative expenses.  In addition,   $14.5 million   was invested in Grizzly and   $4.0 million   was invested in Strike Force during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  We also received approximately   $41.5 million   from the sale of oil and gas properties, primarily the sale of non-producing leasehold acreage in the non-core area of our Utica acreage.  We did not make any investments in our other equity investments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was $  426.3 million   as compared to $  1.2 billion   for the same period in   2015  .  The   2016   amount provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the net proceeds of approximately   $411.7 million   from our 2016 equity offering. 
  Credit Facility.     
  We have entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility, as amended, with The Bank of Nova Scotia, as the lead arranger and administrative agent and certain lenders from time to time party thereto.  The credit agreement provides for a maximum facility amount of $1.5 billion and matures on June 6, 2018.  On February 19, 2016, we further amended our credit facility to, among other things, (a) increase the basket for unsecured debt issuances to $1.35 billion from $1.2 billion (of which $950 million was then outstanding), (b) reaffirm our borrowing base of $700.0 million, and (c) increase the percentage of projected oil and gas production that may be hedged by us during 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility and total funds available for borrowing, after giving effect to an aggregate of   $207.0 million   of outstanding letters of credit, were   $493.0 million  .  This facility is secured by substantially all of our assets.  Our wholly-owned subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under our revolving credit facility. 
  Advances under our revolving credit facility may be in the form of either base rate loans or eurodollar loans.  The interest rate for base rate loans is equal to (1) the applicable rate, which ranges from 0.50% to 1.50%, plus (2) the highest of: (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by agent as its  prime rate,  and (c) the eurodollar rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%.  The interest rate for eurodollar loans is equal to (1) the applicable rate, which ranges from 1.50% to 2.50%, plus (2) the London interbank offered rate that appears on pages LIBOR01 or LIBOR02 of the Reuters screen that displays such rate for deposits in U.S. dollars, or, if such rate is not available, the rate as administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (or any other person that takes over administration of such rate) per annum equal to the offered rate on such other page or other service that displays an average London interbank offered rate as administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (or any other person that takes over the administration of such rate) for deposits in U.S. dollars, or, if such rate is not available, the average quotations for three major New York money center banks of whom the agent shall inquire as the  London Interbank Offered Rate  for deposits in U.S. dollars.  
  Our revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on our and our subsidiaries' ability to: incur indebtedness; grant liens; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; make investments; make fundamental changes; enter into swap contracts and forward sales contracts; dispose of assets; change the nature of their business; and enter into transactions with their affiliates.  The negative covenants are subject to certain exceptions as specified in our revolving credit facility.  Our revolving credit facility also contains certain affirmative covenants, including, but not limited to the following financial covenants: (1) the ratio of net funded debt to EBITDAX (net income, excluding (i) any non-cash revenue or expense associated with swap contracts resulting from ASC 815 and (ii) any cash or non-cash revenue or expense attributable to minority investment plus without duplication and, in the case of expenses, to the extent deducted from revenues in determining net income, the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of consolidated interest expense for such period, (b) the aggregate amount of income, franchise, capital or similar tax expense (other than ad valorem taxes) for such period, (c) all amounts attributable to depletion, depreciation, amortization and asset or goodwill impairment or writedown for such period, (d) all other non-cash charges, (e) exploration costs deducted in determining net income under successful efforts accounting, (f) actual cash distributions received from minority investments, (g) to the extent actually reimbursed by insurance, expenses with respect to liability on casualty events or business interruption, and (h) all reasonable transaction expenses related to dispositions and acquisitions of assets, investments and debt and equity offerings (provided that expenses related to any  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

unsuccessful dispositions will be limited to $3.0 million in the aggregate) for a twelve-month period may not be greater than 4.00 to 1.00; and (2) the ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense for a twelve-month period may not be less than 3.00 to 1.00.  We were in compliance with these financial covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Senior Notes due 2020  .   
  In October 2012, December 2012 and August 2014, we issued an aggregate of $600.0 million in principal amount of our senior notes due 2020 which we refer to as the 2020 Notes.  Interest on the 2020 Notes accrued at a rate of 7.75% per annum on the outstanding principal amount payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year.  The 2020 Notes were scheduled to mature on November 1, 2020.  On October 6, 2016, we commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the 2020 Notes, which tender offer expired on October 13, 2016 and settled on October 14, 2016.  Holders of the 2020 Notes that were validly tendered and accepted at or prior to the expiration time of the tender offer, or who delivered the 2020 Notes pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures, received total cash consideration of $1,042.00 per $1,000 principal amount of notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the settlement date.  An aggregate of $403.5 principal amount of the 2020 Notes was validly tendered in the tender offer.  The remaining 2020 Notes that were not tendered in the tender offer were redeemed by us.  The redemption payment included approximately $196.5 million in aggregate principal amount at a redemption price of 103.875% of the principal amount of the redeemed 2020 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.  Upon deposit of the redemption payment with the paying agent on October 14, 2016, the indenture governing the 2020 Notes was fully satisfied and discharged.  The cash tender offer for the 2020 Notes and redemption of the remaining 2020 Notes were funded with the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Notes (discussed in more detail below) and cash on hand. 
  Outstanding Senior Notes. 
  Senior Notes due 2023  . In April 2015, we issued an aggregate of $350.0 million in principal amount of our senior notes due 2023.  Interest on these senior notes, which we refer to as the 2023 Notes, accrues at a rate of 6.625% per annum on the outstanding principal amount thereof on May 1 and November 1 of each year.  The 2023 Notes mature on May 1, 2023.  The 2023 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness.  
  Senior Notes due 2024  . On October 14, 2016, we issued $650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2024, which we refer to as the 2024 Notes.  Interest on the 2024 Notes accrues at a rate of 6.000% per annum on the outstanding principal amount thereof from October 14, 2016, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2017.  The 2024 Notes will mature on October 15, 2024.  The 2024 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior indebtedness, including the 2023 Notes, and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness.  
  We may redeem some or all of the 2024 Notes at any time on or after October 15, 2019, at the redemption prices listed in the indenture relating to the 2024 Notes.  Prior to October 15, 2019, we may redeem all or a portion of the 2024 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus a  make-whole  premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.  In addition, any time prior to October 15, 2019, we may redeem the 2024 Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes issued prior to such date at a redemption price of 106%, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with an amount equal to the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings.  
  If we experience a change of control (as defined in the indenture relating to the 2024 Notes), we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2024 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.  If we sell certain assets and fail to use the proceeds in a manner specified in the indenture, we will be required to use the remaining proceeds to make an offer to repurchase the 2024 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.  
  In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, we and our subsidiary guarantors entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the Notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  We may be required to file a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the 2024 Notes under certain circumstances.  If we fail to satisfy these obligations under the registration rights agreement, we agreed to pay additional interest to the holders of the 2024 Notes as specified in the registration rights agreement.

     Table of Contents  

All of our existing restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our secured revolving credit facility or certain other debt (other than Grizzly Holdings, Inc.) guarantee the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes.  The guarantees rank equally in the right of payment with all of the senior indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantors and senior in the right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantors.  The 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors' secured indebtedness (including all borrowings and other obligations under our credit agreement) to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes.  
  The senior note indentures relating to the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes contain certain covenants that, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, make certain investments, declare or pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, prepay subordinated indebtedness, sell assets including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries, agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur liens, engage in business other than the oil and gas business and designate certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.  For additional information regarding the 2023 Notes and the 2024 Notes, see Note 6, Note 14 and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.  
  Construction Loan.   
  In June 2015, we entered into a construction loan agreement, or the construction loan, with InterBank for the construction of our new corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City.  The construction loan allows for maximum principal borrowings of $24.5 million and requires us to fund 30% of the estimated cost of the construction before any funds can be drawn, which occurred in January 2016.  Interest accrues daily on the outstanding principal balance at a fixed rate of 4.5% per annum and is payable on the last day of the month through May 31, 2017.  Monthly interest and principal payments are due beginning June 30, 2017, with the final payment due June 4, 2025.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $16.5 million   of borrowings were outstanding under the construction loan. 
  Capital Expenditures  .  
  Our recent capital commitments have been primarily for the execution of our drilling programs, for acquisitions primarily in the Utica Shale, and for investments in entities that may provide services to facilitate the development of our acreage.  Our strategy is to continue to (1) increase cash flow generated from our operations by undertaking new drilling, workover, sidetrack and recompletion projects to exploit our existing properties, subject to economic and industry conditions, (2) pursue acquisition and disposition opportunities and (3) pursue business integration opportunities.  
  Of our net reserves at   December 31, 2015  , 55.0% were categorized as proved undeveloped.  Our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved developed reserves, or both.  To realize reserves and increase production, we must continue our exploratory drilling, undertake other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish those activities.  
  From January 1, 2016 through   October 28, 2016  , we spud 35 gross (31.7 net) wells in the Utica Shale.  We currently expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be $299.0 million to $347.0 million to drill 42 to 46 gross (36 to 39 net) horizontal wells and commence sales from 50 to 56 gross (37 to 41 net) wells on our Utica Shale acreage.  As of   October 28, 2016  , we had four operated horizontal rigs drilling in the play.  We also anticipate an additional 20 to 22 gross (three to four net) horizontal wells will be drilled, and sales commenced from 25 to 27 gross (six to seven net) horizontal wells, on our Utica Shale acreage by other operators for estimated 2016 expenditures to us of $90.0 million to $100.0 million.  In addition, we currently expect to spend $40.0 million to $50.0 million in 2016 for acreage expenses, primarily lease extensions, in the Utica Shale.  
  From January 1, 2016 through   October 28, 2016  , we recompleted 48 existing wells and spud no new wells at our WCBB field.  In our Hackberry fields, from January 1, 2016 through   October 28, 2016  , we recompleted 19 existing wells and spud no new wells.  We currently expect our   2016   capital expenditures to be $26.0 million to $28.0 million for maintenance capital expenditures and recompletions in Southern Louisiana.  
   From January 1, 2016 through   October 28, 2016  , no new wells were spud on our Niobrara Formation acreage. We do not currently anticipate any capital expenditures in the Niobrara Formation in   2016  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our net investment in Grizzly was approximately   $48.6   million.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we paid cash calls of   $14.5 million   to Grizzly.  Effective October 5, 2012, Grizzly entered into a $125.0  
  
   47 

     Table of Contents  

million revolving credit facility, of which all outstanding balance was paid as of   September 30, 2016  .  We do not currently anticipate any additional material capital expenditures in 2016 related to Grizzly's activities. 
  In connection with the formation of Strike Force, we contributed certain assets valued at $22.5 million, including an approximately 11 mile-long, 12-inch diameter gathering line.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we paid cash calls of   $4.0 million   to Strike Force.  We currently expect to make $20.0 million to $25.0 million in cash contributions to Strike Force in 2016. 
  We had no capital expenditures during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   related to our interests in Thailand.  We do not currently anticipate any capital expenditures in Thailand in   2016  . 
  In an effort to facilitate the development of our Utica Shale and other domestic acreage, we have invested in entities that can provide services that are required to support our operations, including pressure pumping and proppant.  See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these other investments.  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we did not make any investments in these entities, and we do not currently anticipate any capital expenditures related to these entities in   2016  .  
  During 2015 and 2016, we continued to focus on operational efficiencies in an effort to reduce our overall well costs and deliver better results in a more economical manner, particularly in light of the continued downturn in commodity prices.  We have successfully leveraged the lower commodity price environment to gain access to higher-quality equipment and superior services for reduced costs, which has contributed to increased productivity.  We have also renegotiated the contracts for our horizontal drilling rigs and locked in approximately 70% of our drilling and completion costs through the remainder of 2016 and 2017.  This has allowed us to secure a base level of activity for 2017, hedge against increases in service costs and ensure access to quality equipment and experienced crews, all of which we expect to contribute to further efficiency gains.  
  With regard to our leasehold position, we continue to upgrade our acreage within our portfolio and focus our efforts on consolidating our premium, core position in the wet gas and dry gas windows of the Utica Shale.  During the third quarter of 2016, we sold a non-core exploratory acreage position in the Utica Shale in West Virginia and have already started to re-invest the net proceeds from that sale just across the border in the dry gas window of the Utica Shale in Ohio.  We believe a significant organic leasing opportunity is unfolding in this area, where infrastructure build out exists or is underway and where we experience favorable economic returns.  
  As a result of the decline in commodity prices, our initial 2016 development plan contemplated running three rigs beginning in January 2016 and reducing activity levels throughout the year for an average of 2.5 rigs on our operated Utica Shale acreage during 2016, as compared to an average of 3.7 rigs in 2015.  However, in response to the recent strengthening of natural gas prices, we contracted a fourth rig that began operations in September 2016 and currently plan to add two additional rigs, one in November 2016 and the other in December 2016. Our total capital expenditures for 2016 are currently estimated to be in the range of $475.0 million to $550.0 million, including $415.0 million to $475.0 million for drilling and completion expenditures, of which $369.2 million was spent as of September 30, 2016, $40.0 million to $50.0 million for acreage expenses, primarily lease extensions, in the Utica Shale, of which $9.8 million ($51.3 million net of   $41.5 million   of proceeds from our sale of non-producing, non-core exploratory leasehold acreage) was spent as of September 30, 2016, and $20.0 million to $25.0 million to fund our investment in Strike Force.  Approximately 95% of our 2016 estimated capital expenditures are currently expected to be spent in the Utica Shale.  The estimated 2016 range of capital expenditures for drilling and completion is down from the $851.8 million spent in 2015, primarily due to the low commodity price environment and a desire to maintain a favorable liquidity position. 
  We continually monitor market conditions and are prepared to adjust our drilling program if commodity prices dictate.  Currently, we believe that our cash flow from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our loan agreements will be sufficient to meet our normal recurring operating needs and capital requirements for the next twelve months.  We believe that our strong liquidity position, hedge portfolio and conservative balance sheet position us well to react quickly to changing commodity prices and accelerate our activity within the Utica Basin to a six or possibly eight rig program in 2017, or to scale back our activity, as the market conditions warrant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event commodity prices decline further, our capital or other costs increase, our equity investments require additional contributions and/or we pursue additional equity method investments or acquisitions, we may be required to obtain additional funds which we would seek to do through traditional borrowings, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means, including the sale of assets.  We regularly evaluate new acquisition opportunities.  Needed capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  Further, if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay or curtail implementation of our business plan or not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us.  If the low commodity price environment  
  
   48 

     Table of Contents  

continues or worsens, our revenues, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity and reserves may be materially and adversely affected. 
  Commodity Price Risk  
  The volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty.  During the past six years, the posted price for West Texas intermediate light sweet crude oil, which we refer to as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, has ranged from a low of $26.05 per barrel, or Bbl, in February 2016 to a high of $113.39 per Bbl in April 2011.  The Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.61 per MMBtu in March 2016 to a high of $7.51 per MMBtu in January 2010.  On October 28, 2016, the WTI posted price for crude oil was $48.70 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was $3.11 per MMBtu.  If the prices of oil and natural gas continue at current levels or decline further, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected.  In addition, lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically.  This may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves.  If this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed, full cost accounting rules may require us to further write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.  Reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, which could further limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities. 
  See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for information regarding our open fixed price swaps at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Commitments  
  In connection with our acquisition in 1997 of the remaining 50% interest in the WCBB properties, we assumed the seller's (Chevron) obligation to contribute approximately $18,000 per month through March 2004, to a plugging and abandonment trust and the obligation to plug a minimum of 20 wells per year for 20 years commencing March 11, 1997.  Chevron retained a security interest in production from these properties until our abandonment obligations to Chevron have been fulfilled.  Beginning in 2009, we could access the trust for use in plugging and abandonment charges associated with the property.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the plugging and abandonment trust totaled approximately   $3.1 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we have plugged   483   wells at WCBB since we began our plugging program in 1997, which management believes fulfills our current minimum plugging obligation.  
  Contractual and Commercial Obligations 
  We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities.  There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .     
  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016  .    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , and most industry-specific guidance.  The core principle of the new standard is for the recognition of revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the payment to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard will also result in enhanced revenue disclosures, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements.  The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, using either a full or a modified retrospective application approach.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date by one year (until 2018).  We are in the process of evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements.

     Table of Contents  

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40).        The new guidance addresses management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and in certain circumstances to provide related footnote disclosures.  The standard is effective for periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  We do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysi  s.  This ASU provides additional guidance to reporting entities in evaluating whether certain legal entities, such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporation and securitization structure, should be consolidated.  The ASU is considered to be an improvement on current accounting requirements as it reduces the number of existing consolidation models.  The ASU is for periods after December 15, 2015 and is required to be adopted using a retrospective or modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2016.  As a result, certain of our equity investments were determined to be variable interest entites; however, we were not required to consolidate these investments. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  . To simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs, ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  This guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2015.  We adopted this guidance effective December 31, 2015, and have reclassified   $16.0 million   and   $17.9 million   of debt issuance costs to offset long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as shown in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.    The guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated.  Measurement period adjustments are calculated as if they were known at the acquisition date, but are recognized in the reporting period in which they are determined.  Additional disclosures are required about the impact on current-period income statement line items of adjustments that would have been recognized in prior periods if the prior-period information had been revised.  The guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2015.  We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 705)  .  Current guidance requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference.  To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred income tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.  This guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  .  The guidance requires the lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet thereby resulting in the recognition of lease assets and liability for those leases currently classified as operating leases.  The accounting for lessors is largely unchanged.  The guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-05,   Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  .  The guidance was issued to clarify that change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that had been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815, does not require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  This guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements.  We do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because all current derivative instruments are not designated for hedge accounting. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Equity Method and Joint Ventures.   This guidance simplified current requirements by eliminating the need to retrospectively apply the equity method of accounting upon obtaining significant influence over an investment that it previously accounted for under the cost basis or at fair value.  This guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact on our

consolidated financial statements.  We do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because all current investments are accounted under the equity method investment. 
  In March 2016, the FSB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This guidance was intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  This guidance is effective for periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging: Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting.    This guidance rescinds SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified in Topic 606, Revenue Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities--Oil and Gas.  This amendment is effective upon adoption of Topic 606.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    This guidance provides guidance of eight specific cash flow issues. This amendment is effective for periods after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.  Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors, including: worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas; the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; the expected rates of declining current production; weather conditions, including hurricanes, that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area; the level of consumer demand; the price and availability of alternative fuels; technical advances affecting energy consumption; risks associated with operating drilling rigs; the availability of pipeline capacity; the price and level of foreign imports; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; and the overall economic environment.  
  These factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty.  During the past six years, the posted price for WTI, has ranged from a low of $26.05 per barrel, or Bbl, in February 2016 to a high of $113.39 per Bbl in April 2011.  The Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.61 per MMBtu in March 2016 to a high of $7.51 per MMBtu in January 2010.  On October 28, 2016, the WTI posted price for crude oil was $48.70 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was $3.11 per MMBtu.  If the prices of oil and natural gas continue at current levels or decline further, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves may be materially and adversely affected.  In addition, lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically.  This may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves.  If this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development activities are curtailed, full cost accounting rules may require us to further write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties.  Reductions in our reserves could also negatively impact the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, which could further limit our liquidity and ability to conduct additional exploration and development activities.  
  To mitigate the effects of commodity price fluctuations on our oil and natural gas production, we had the following open fixed price swap positions at   September 30, 2016  :  

51 

     Table of Contents  

We sold call options and used the associated premiums to enhance the fixed price for a portion of the fixed price natural gas swaps listed above.  Each short call option has an established ceiling price.  When the referenced settlement price is above the price ceiling established by these short call options, we pay our counterparty an amount equal to the difference between the referenced settlement price and the price ceiling multiplied by the hedged contract volume. 

For a portion of the combined natural gas derivative instruments containing fixed price swaps and sold call options, the counterparty has an option to extend the original terms an additional twelve months for the period January 2017 through December 2017.  The option to extend the terms expires in December 2016.  If executed, we would have additional fixed price swaps for 30,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average price of $3.33 per MMBtu and additional short call options for 30,000 MMBtu per day at a weighted average ceiling price of $3.33 per MMBtu. 
  In addition, we have entered into natural gas basis swap positions, which settle on the pricing index to basis differential of MichCon or Tetco M2 to the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the following natural gas basis swap positions for MichCon and Tetco M2, respectively. 

Under our 2016 contracts, we have hedged approximately 75% to 79% of our estimated 2016 production.  Such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a net asset derivative position of   $2.5 million   as compared to a net asset derivative position of   $161.7 million   as of   September 30, 2015  , related to our fixed price swaps.  Utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase in underlying commodity prices would have reduced the fair value of these instruments by approximately $79.8 million, while a 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices would have increased the fair value of these instruments by approximately $79.8 million.  However, any realized derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase, respectively, in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument.

Our revolving amended and restated credit agreement is structured under floating rate terms, as advances under this facility may be in the form of either base rate loans or eurodollar loans.  As such, our interest expense is sensitive to fluctuations in the prime rates in the U.S. or, if the eurodollar rates are elected, the eurodollar rates.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no variable interest rate borrowings outstanding; therefore, an increase in interest rates would not have impacted our interest expense.  Our interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.18% on April 20, 2015, the last day on which borrowings were outstanding under such facility.  An increase or decrease of 1% in the interest rate would have a corresponding decrease or increase in our interest expense of approximately $3.0 million based on the $300.0 million outstanding in the aggregate under our revolving credit facility as of such date.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any interest rate swaps to hedge our interest risks. 
   
                 ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures  .  Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Accounting Officer, we have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.  The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  .  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.

    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In two separate complaints, one filed by the State of Louisiana and the Parish of Cameron in the 38th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Cameron on February 9, 2016 and the other filed by the State of Louisiana and the District Attorney for the 15   th    Judicial District of the State of Louisiana in the 15   th    Judicial District Court for the Parish of Vermillion on July 29, 2016, we were named as a defendant, among 26 oil and gas companies, in the Cameron Parish complaint and among more than 40 oil and gas companies in the Vermillion Parish complaint, or the Complaints.  The Complaints were filed under the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended, and the rules, regulations, orders and ordinances adopted thereunder, which we referred to collectively as the CZM Laws, and allege that certain of the defendants  oil and gas exploration, production and transportation operations associated with the development of the East Hackberry and West Hackberry oil and gas fields, in the case of the Cameron Parish complaint, and the Tigre Lagoon oil and gas field, in the case of the Vermillion Parish complaint, were conducted in violation of the CZM Laws. The Complaints allege that such activities caused substantial damage to land and waterbodies located in the coastal zone of the relevant Parish, including due to defendants  design, construction and use of waste pits and the alleged failure to properly close the waste pits and to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify and return the property affected to its original condition, as well as the defendants  alleged discharge of waste into the coastal zone.  The Complaints also allege that the defendants  oil and gas activities have resulted in the dredging of numerous canals, which had a direct and significant impact on the state coastal waters within the relevant Parish and that the defendants, among other things, failed to design, construct and maintain these canals using the best practical techniques to prevent bank slumping, erosion and saltwater intrusion and to minimize the potential for inland movement of storm-generated surges, which activities allegedly have resulted in the erosion of marshes and the degradation of terrestrial and aquatic life therein.  The Complaints also allege that the defendants failed to re-vegetate, refill, clean, detoxify and otherwise restore these canals to their original condition.  In these two petitions, the plaintiffs seek damages and other appropriate relief under the CZM Laws, including the payment of costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify and otherwise restore the affected coastal zone of the relevant Parish to its original condition, actual restoration of such coastal zone to its original condition, and the payment of reasonable attorney fees and legal expenses and pre-judgment and post judgment interest. 
   We were served with the Cameron complaint in early May 2016 and with the Vermillion Complaint in early September 2016.  The Louisiana Attorney General and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources intervened in both the Cameron Parish suit and the Vermillion Parish suit.  Shortly after the Complaints were filed, certain defendants removed the cases to the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.  In both cases, the plaintiffs have filed a motion to remand, but both Courts have stayed further proceedings on the motions to remand pending a ruling from the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit on similar jurisdictional issues in another matter.  The plaintiffs have granted all defendants an extension of time to file responsive pleadings to the Complaints until the District Courts rule on the motions to remand.  We have not had the opportunity to evaluate the applicability of the allegations made in such complaints to our operations.  Due to the early stages of these matters, management cannot determine the amount of loss, if any, that may result. 
  In addition, due to the nature of our business, we are, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities, including workers' compensation claims and employment related disputes.  In the opinion of our management, none of the pending litigation, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Exhibit 10.1 

SEPARATION AND RELEASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN      GULFPORT ENERGY CORPORATION AND ROSS KIRTLEY 
    
  THIS SEPARATION AND RELEASE AGREEMENT   (this    Agreement   ) is made and entered into by and between Gulfport Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the    Company   ), and Ross Kirtley (   Employee   ) and will be effective as of the lapse of the Revocation Period set forth in Section 1.10.2 hereof (the    Effective Date   ).   
  RECITALS 
  WHEREAS  , on August 5, 2016, the Company provided Employee with a written notice of his termination; and    
  WHEREAS  , the Company desires to provide Employee with severance pay and to memorialize certain agreements between them, in each case on the terms set forth herein.  
  NOW, THEREFORE  , in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
  1.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT 
  1.1        Termination  .  The parties acknowledge and agree that Employee s employment with the Company terminated on August 5, 2016 (the    Termination Date   ).  The Company agrees to characterize Employee s termination as  without cause  under Section 5.3 of the Employment Agreement between the parties, dated as of April 22, 2014 (the    Employment Agreement   ).  With the exception of Employee s vested benefits, interests or rights in the Company s 401(k) plan or other employee benefit plans in which Employee is a participant, if any, Employee acknowledges that, Employee has been paid all wages, compensation, benefits (including all earned and unused vacation days or paid time-off), less applicable tax withholding, and business expenses relating to Employee s employment with the Company through Employee s Termination Date.  
  1.2        Benefit Plans  .  The benefits received by Employee and Employee s eligible dependents under the Company s group health plan will cease as of the last day of the month during which the Termination Date occurs.  Thereafter, pursuant to governing law and independent of this Agreement, Employee will be entitled to elect benefit continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (   COBRA   ), if Employee timely applies for such coverage.  Information regarding Employee s eligibility for COBRA coverage, and the terms and conditions of such coverage, will be provided to Employee in a separate mailing.   
  1.3        Consideration for Release  .  In consideration of Employee executing (and not timely revoking) this Agreement, in full settlement of any compensation or benefits to which Employee otherwise could claim to be entitled under the Employment Agreement or otherwise, and in exchange for the promises, covenants, releases, and waivers set forth in this Agreement, the Company will provide the severance benefits described herein.  Employee acknowledges that under Section 6.1.3 of the Employment Agreement he is not entitled to these severance benefits absent the Release of Claims in Section 1.6 of this Agreement, which is substantially in the form of the General Release attached as Exhibit A to the Employment Agreement. 
  1.3.1        Severance Payment  .  Employee will be entitled to a lump sum severance payment on the fourteenth (14   th   ) day following the Effective Date in the amount of six hundred twenty-one thousand and seventy-five dollars ($621,075), representing 175% of Employee s base salary in effect on the Termination Date, less applicable withholdings.  
  1.3.2        COBRA Payment  . Starting on the first payroll date following the eighth (8th) day after Employee signs this Agreement, the Company shall pay Employee one thousand, one hundred ninety-four dollars and forty-four cents ($1,194.44) each month, less applicable taxes and deductions, for the lesser of eighteen (18) months, or until such time as Employee becomes eligible for group health plan benefits from another employer.  Employee agrees to promptly inform the Company in writing within five (5) days if he becomes eligible to receive group health

Exhibit 10.1 

coverage from another employer or ceases to receive COBRA continuation coverage under the Company s group health plan.   
  1.3.3        Company Vehicle  . The Company shall transfer ownership of the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland 4x4 (VIN 1C4RJFCGXEC238766) (the    Vehicle   ) to Employee. The Parties shall cooperate to effectuate the prompt transfer of the Vehicle s title from the Company to Employee.  Employee shall be responsible for obtaining insurance coverage for the Vehicle and all costs associated therewith as well as all other costs including, but not limited to, tax and registration fees associated with the transfer of ownership of the Vehicle.  Employee shall not operate the Vehicle nor permit others to do so until the transfer of title is completed.  The fair market value of the Vehicle is $25,000.00, which the parties acknowledge and agree will be treated as wages subject to withholding for income and employment tax purposes. 
  1.3.4        Company Stock.      Employee shall vest, as of the Effective Date, in the 14,820 restricted stock units granted to him by the Company on March 10, 2016 (the  March 2016 Award ).  All settlement dates for these restricted stock units shall be consistent with the March 2016 Award such that the restricted stock units are settled in four (4) substantially equal annual installments beginning March 10, 2017; provided, however, that in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the March 2016 Award) all remaining settlement dates shall immediately accelerate and, at the time of such Change in Control, all remaining restricted stock units granted as part of the March 2016 Award shall be settled.  In addition, the remaining 3,000 unvested shares of restricted stock included in that certain restricted stock award granted to Employee by the Company on August 27, 2013 shall immediately vest and settle on the Effective Date.  All other restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted to Employee shall be forfeited and will terminate.  All stock awards vesting under this Section 1.3.4 will be subject to applicable tax withholding as provided in Section 3.12.5.   
  1.4        Satisfaction of Liabilities  .  Employee acknowledges and agrees that the consideration provided in Section 1.3 above: (a) is in full discharge of any and all liabilities and obligations the Company or its subsidiaries have to Employee, monetarily or otherwise, with respect to Employee s employment; and (b) exceeds any payment, benefit, or other thing of value to which Employee might otherwise be entitled.  Employee specifically acknowledges and agrees that the Company has paid to Employee all of the wages, commissions, overtime, premiums, vacation, sick pay, holiday pay, equity, phantom equity, carried interest, bonuses, deferred compensation, and other forms of compensation, benefits, and perquisites to which Employee was or may have been entitled, and that the Company and its subsidiaries do not owe Employee any other wages, commissions, overtime, premiums, vacation, sick pay, holiday pay, equity, phantom equity, carried interest, bonuses, deferred compensation, or other forms of compensation, benefits, perquisites, or payments of any kind or nature, other than as explicitly provided in this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, Employee s eligibility and entitlement to any 401(k) matching contributions the Company provides to eligible participants attributable to Employee s compensation earned through the Termination Date during the 2016 plan year will be determined pursuant to the terms of the Company s 401(k) plan. 
  1.5        Return of the Company Property  .  Employee represents and warrants that, in compliance with Section 4 of the Employment Agreement, he has returned to the Company all property, proprietary materials, Confidential Information (as defined in the Employment Agreement), documents and computer media in any form (and all copies thereof) relating or belonging to any Releasee (as defined below) or any Releasee s clients, customers, counterparties, suppliers, vendors, or investors (or potential clients, customers, counterparties, suppliers, vendors, or investors), including but not limited to all manuals; photographs; reports; spreadsheets; analyses; data; memoranda; correspondence; engineering studies, property surveys, processes, plans, devices, products, computer programs and other tangible and intangible property relating to the business of the Company; pricing information; supplier lists; vendor lists; plans; costs; software; equipment (including, but not limited to, computers and computer-related items, including all computer software, smartphones, and other devices); computer system and software passwords, access codes, and authorization codes; identification keys; the Company credit cards; and all other materials or other things in Employee s possession, custody, or control which are the property of any of the Releasees.   
  1.6        Releases of All Claims  .  In exchange for the consideration provided to Employee pursuant to this Agreement, Employee, on behalf of Employee and all of Employee s heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns (collectively,    Releasors   ), hereby releases and forever waives and discharges any and all claims, liabilities, causes of

  2.        COVENANTS 
  2.1        Surviving Provisions  .

The Company will reimburse Employee for reasonable pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys  fees required by the Company s request.  Except as provided in Section 2.3 above, Employee agrees that, in the event he is served with a subpoena, document request, interrogatory, or any other legal process that will or may require Employee to disclose any confidential information following the Termination Date, Employee will immediately notify the Company s corporate counsel of such fact, in writing, and provide a copy of such subpoena, document request, interrogatory, or other legal process, and shall thereafter cooperate with the Company in any lawful response to such subpoena, document request, interrogatory, or legal process as the Company may request without any further compensation to Employee; provided that, the Company will reimburse Employee for any reasonable, pre-approved out of pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys  fees Employee incurs in connection with such cooperation.

In addition, following the Termination Date, Employee will not, whether in private or in public, directly or indirectly, and in each case, as to the other: (a) make, publish, encourage, ratify, or authorize, or aid, assist, or direct any other person or entity in making or publishing, any statements that in any way defame, criticize, malign, impugn, reflect negatively on, or disparage any Company Group Member, or any of the other Releasees, or place any Company Group Member or any other Releasee in a negative light, in any manner whatsoever; (b) comment upon or discuss any of the Releasees (whether disparagingly or otherwise) on any Media (as defined below); (c) make any statement, posting, or other communication (including on or through any Media) that purports to be on behalf of any Company Group Member, or which a third party may perceive (i) has been authorized, approved, or endorsed by a Company Group Member or (ii) reflects the views of any Company Group Member; (d) share, post, transmit, or upload any material related to any of the Releasees (regardless of whether such comments, statements, or material are disparaging) with, to, through, or on any Media; (e) utilize any Company Group Member s logo, graphics, trade names, or trademarks on any Media or for any other purpose; (f) provide any Company Group Member s promotional material to any Media outlet; or (g) aid, assist, or direct any other person or entity to do any of the foregoing.

   5 

Exhibit 10.1 

Foursquare, PeekYou, MyLife, Glassdoor, and the like), chat rooms, newspapers, magazines, periodicals, journals, television stations or productions, radio stations, news organizations, news outlets,  apps,  or publications, or any movie, book, or theatrical production,or any statement in any public forum (i.e., lectures, to the media, in published articles, to analysts, or in comparable public forums), whether defamatory or not, to any person or entity regarding the Company s management, legal or regulatory compliance, financial, personnel, marketing, bidding, investment, purchasing or customer service practices or procedures, or regarding whether the Company or any officer, director or shareholder thereof is acting or has acted in compliance with any federal, state or local law, regulation or ordinance.  Employee may, however, disclose to any party, including without limitation potential employers the fact that he was an employee of the Company and the dates of his tenure and a general description of the duties and responsibilities.  For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be construed in a manner that would violate any law.  The provisions of this Section 2.4 will survive following the expiration, suspension or termination, for any reason, of this Agreement. 
  2.5        Future Employment with Company or Affiliates  . Employee agrees that he is not eligible for re-hire by the Company and shall not, directly or indirectly, seek to become employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  2.6        Remedies  .  Employee and Company agree that any breach of the terms of this Section 2 would result in irreparable injury and damage to the other for which there would be no adequate remedy at law.  They therefore also agree that in the event of said breach or any threat of breach, the other of them will be entitled to an immediate injunction and restraining order to prevent such breach and/or threatened breach and/or continued breach by the other and/or any and all persons and/or entities acting for and/or with the other, without having to prove damages, in addition to any other remedies to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, subject to the proviso set forth in the next sentence.  The terms of this Section 2.6 will not prevent either party from pursuing any other available remedies for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including but not limited to the recovery of damages.  Employee and the Company further agree that the provisions of the covenants are reasonable and reasonably calculated to protect from disclosure the trade secrets and proprietary information of the Company.  Should a court or arbitrator determine, however, that any provision of the covenants is unreasonable or unenforceable, either in period of time, scope, or otherwise, the parties hereto agree that the covenant should be interpreted and enforced to the maximum extent which such court or arbitrator deems reasonable.   
  2.7        Survival  .  The provisions of this Section 2 will survive any expiration, suspension or termination, for any reason, of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action by Employee against the Company, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of the covenants and agreements of this Section 2.   
  3.        MISCELLANEOUS 
  3.1        Dispute Resolution  .

Payments under this Agreement will be administered and interpreted to maximize the short-term deferral exception to and under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the    Code   ), and the regulations thereunder (collectively,    Section 409A   ) and the exception from Section 409A provided under Treas. Reg.   1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) for involuntary separation pay.  Designated payment dates provided for in this Agreement are deemed to incorporate the grace periods provided by Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(d), and the Employee will not be permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate the taxable year of any payment.

   8 

Exhibit 10.1 

3.12.3        General 409A Provisions  .  If for any reason, the short-term deferral exception or the involuntary separation pay exception is inapplicable, payments and benefits payable to Employee under this Agreement are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A.  To the extent the payments and benefits under this Agreement are subject to Section 409A, this Agreement will be interpreted, construed and administered in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any applicable transition relief under Section 409A).  The Company does not guaranty or warrant the tax consequences of this Agreement and, except as specifically provided to the contrary in this Agreement, Employee will, in all cases, be liable for any taxes due as a result of this Agreement.  Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries will have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold Employee harmless from any or all such taxes, interest or penalties, or liability for any damages related thereto.  Employee acknowledges that he has been advised to obtain independent legal, tax or other counsel in connection with Section 409A.   
  (a)      If Employee or the Company determines that any payments or benefits payable under this Agreement intended to comply with Sections 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Code do not comply with Section 409A, Employee and the Company agree to amend this Agreement, or take such other actions as Employee and the Company deem reasonably necessary or appropriate, to comply with the requirements of Section 409A, the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any applicable relief provisions) while preserving the economic agreement of the parties.  If any provision of the Agreement would cause such payments or benefits to fail to so comply, such provision will not be effective and will be null and void with respect to such payments or benefits, and such provision will otherwise remain in full force and effect. 
  (b)      All payments considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A and the regulations thereunder will be made on the date(s) provided herein and no request to accelerate or defer any payment under this Section will be considered or approved for any reason whatsoever, except as permitted under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts payable hereunder which are not nonqualified deferred compensation, or which may be accelerated pursuant to Section 409A, such as distributions for applicable tax payments, may be accelerated, but not deferred, at the sole discretion of the Company. 
  (c)      All references in this Agreement to termination of this Agreement or termination of services or termination mean Employee s  separation from service  as that term is defined in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations. 
  (d)      All reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this agreement that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A will be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A, including that (i) in no event will reimbursements by the Company under this agreement be made later than the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the applicable fees and expenses were incurred, provided that Employee submits an invoice for such fees and expenses at least 10 days before the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which such fees and expenses were incurred; and (ii) Employee s right to have the Company pay or provide such reimbursements and in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit. 
  3.12.4        Specified Employee Status  .  If Employee is a specified employee (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) on the date of his separation from service, any payments made with respect to such separation from service under this Agreement, and other payments or benefits under this Agreement that are subject to Section 409A, will be delayed in order to comply with Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, and such payments or benefits will be paid or distributed to Employee during the five-day period commencing on the earlier of:  (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Employee s separation from service, or (ii) the date of Employee s death.  Upon the expiration of the applicable six-month period under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, all payments deferred pursuant to this Section 3.12.4 will be paid to Employee (or Employee s estate, in the event of Employee s death) in a lump sum payment.  Any remaining payments and benefits due under the Agreement will be paid as otherwise provided in the Agreement.
