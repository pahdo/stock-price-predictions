FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  

Certain
statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are  forward-looking statements  regarding the plans and objectives
of management for future operations and market trends and expectations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein
are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Our plans and objectives are based, in part,
on assumptions involving the continued expansion of our business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with
respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which
are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Although we believe that our assumptions
underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there
can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant
uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded
as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to revise
or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. The terms  we ,  our ,  us ,
or any derivative thereof, as used herein refer to Trenton Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation.

Note 1 - 
      Organization
    and Business   

Business Activity  

Trenton Acquisition Corp. ( the Company )
was incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 18, 2011 with the objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business. 

The Company was organized as a vehicle
to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being
a publicly traded corporation. The Company s principal business objective over the next twelve months and beyond will be
to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate short-term earnings. The Company
will not restrict its potential target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location. The analysis of
business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of, the officers and directors of the Company. 

Change in Control Transaction  

On
September 9, 2014, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with unrelated
purchasers (collectively, the  Purchasers ), whereby the Company sold 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common
stock to the Purchasers for an aggregate purchase price of $65,000. Simultaneously, the Company entered into and closed a Repurchase
Agreement (the  Repurchase Agreement ) with its sole stockholder, NLBDIT 2010 Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ( NLBDIT ), whereby NLBDIT sold and the Company repurchased 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common
stock for an aggregate purchase of $65,000. In conjunction with these transactions the loan payable-related party, note payable-related
party, and the related accrued interest were forgiven and converted to additional paid-in capital. As a result of the foregoing
transactions, the Company s former Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, and Director
resigned and one of the Company s new stockholders was appointed President, Secretary, and Director and another new stockholder
was appointed Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The sole member of Rodman   Co., LLC ( Rodman ) is deemed
to beneficially own 3,250,000 shares of the Company s common stock, representing 65% of the Company s issued and outstanding
shares and, as a result, has the ability to control the operations of the Company.  

On
June 30, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company (the  Board ) appointed Zvi Ben-Zvi to the positions of President
and sole director of the Company to fill the vacancies in those positions due to the resignation of Arnold P. Kling.  

On
August 8, 2016, the Board appointed Kenneth J. Kirsch to the position of Chief Financial Officer of the Company to fill the vacancy
in that position due to the resignation of Thomas Pinou.  

Note 2 - 
      Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis of Presentation  

The
accompanying condensed financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for complete financial statement presentation. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods presented have been included.
All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The accompanying condensed financial statements and the information included
under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in
conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Form 10-K
as of March 31, 2016. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year.  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of condensed financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the dates of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Note 2 - 
      Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies (cont d.)   

Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers highly liquid financial
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There are no cash equivalents at the condensed
balance sheet dates. 

Income Taxes  

The Company utilizes the accrual method
of accounting for income taxes. Under the accrual method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates
and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recognized
when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized. 

The Company recognizes the financial statement
benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority would sustain the position upon
examination. For tax positions meeting a  more-likely than-not  threshold, the amount recognized in the condensed
financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting
the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to
uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has no accrued interest or penalties
related to uncertain tax positions. 

Loss Per Common Share  

Basic loss per share is calculated using
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted loss per share includes potentially
dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants, using various methods such as the treasury stock or modified treasury
stock method in the determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period. The Company does not have any potentially
dilutive instruments for either of the periods presented. 

Emerging Growth Company  

The Company is an  emerging
growth company  and has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows the Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting
standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Management does not believe that any
recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying
condensed financial statements. 

Note 3 - 
      Going
    Concern   

The accompanying condensed financial statements
have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and
the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses from inception of approximately
$199,000, and has negative working capital of approximately $68,000 at September 30, 2016, which among other factors raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent upon management s plan to find a suitable acquisition or merger candidate, raise additional capital from the
sales of stock, and receive additional loans from related parties. The accompanying condensed financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Note 4 - 
      Income
    Taxes   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $199,000, subject to certain change of control limitations, to reduce future
federal and state taxable income through 2036. 

The Company currently has no federal or
state tax examinations in progress nor has it had any federal or state examinations since its inception. All of the Company s
tax years are subject to federal and state tax examination.

Company s common stock, representing 65% of the Company s issued and outstanding shares and, thus, can control the
operations of the Company. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the total loan balances of $65,000 and $40,000, respectively,
is unsecured, noninterest-bearing, and has no stipulated repayment terms.

Forward
Looking Statement Notice    

Certain
statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are  forward-looking statements  (within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements
of Trenton Acquisition Corp. ( we ,  us ,  our  or the  Company ) to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking
statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company's plans
and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing
involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business
decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company.
Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions
could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report
will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein,
the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives
and plans of the Company will be achieved.  

Description
of Business    

The
Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 18, 2011 (Inception) and maintains its principal executive office
at 430 Park Avenue, 4 th  Floor, New York, NY 10022. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational
efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition
of, or merger with, an operating business. The Company filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on August 12, 2011, and since its effectiveness, the Company has focused its efforts
to identify a possible business combination.  

The
Company is currently considered to be a  blank check  company. The SEC defines those companies as  any development
stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the  Exchange Act ), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business
plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.  Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting
the sale of securities of  blank check  companies in their respective jurisdictions. The Company is also a  shell
company,  defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act as a company with no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or
nominal operations. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either
debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.  

In
addition, the Company is an  emerging growth company , as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
( JOBS Act ), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies  including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements
of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and
any golden parachute payments not previously approved.  

The
Company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section
102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different
effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election,
our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  

We
will remain an  emerging growth company  until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our
revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period,
(3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (4) when the market
value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently
completed second fiscal quarter. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a  smaller reporting company ,
as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain
of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company,
including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley
Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements,
instead of three years.  

We
were organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the
perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond
such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term
earnings. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location
and, thus, may acquire any type of business.  

We
currently do not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow.  During the next twelve months we anticipate
incurring costs related to:  

(i)   
      filing
    Exchange Act reports, and   

(ii)    
      investigating,
    analyzing and consummating an acquisition.   

We
believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service
providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.
As of the date of the period covered by this report, the Company had $254 in cash. There are no assurances that the Company will
be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and
repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is
also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management s
plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances,
however there is no assurance of additional funding being available.  

The
Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional
funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business
which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business
combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which
desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense,
and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  

Our
current management has not had any contact or discussions with representatives of other entities regarding a business combination
with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development
or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous
risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies.
In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although
our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we
will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only
one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders,
which is likely to occur as a result of our management s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order
to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us,
because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.  

The
Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Our management believes
that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits
of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional
equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for
providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions,
joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different
industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of
such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

As
of September 30, 2016, we had total assets of $254, comprised exclusively of cash, compared with total assets of $2,082 as of
March 31, 2016, also comprised exclusively of cash.  As of September 30, 2016, we had total current liabilities equal
to $68,000, comprised of loan payable to related party and accounts payable and accrued expenses compared to total current liabilities
of $43,000 as of March 31, 2016, comprised of loan payable to related party and accounts payable and accrued expenses. We provide
no assurance that we can continue to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  

The
following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities:  

The
Company has only cash assets and has generated no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of
capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination
with a private operating company. In addition, the Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding
and capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be
able to implement its plan of operations.  

Results
of Operations    

The
Company has not conducted any active operations since inception, except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates. No
revenue has been generated by the Company from January 18, 2011 (Inception), through September 30, 2016. It is unlikely the Company
will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no
assurance. It is management's assertion that these circumstances may hinder the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
The Company s plan of operation for the next 12 months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates.   

For
the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $16,152 and $26,828 comprised of legal, accounting,
audit and other professional service fees incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of the Company s periodic
reports and general and administrative expenses  

For
the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a net loss of $8,895 and $15,685, respectively, comprised of
legal, accounting, audit and other professional service fees incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of the Company s
periodic reports and general and administrative expenses.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
