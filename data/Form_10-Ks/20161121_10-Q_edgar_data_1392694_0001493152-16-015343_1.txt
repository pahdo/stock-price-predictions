1     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND BUSINESS   

Basis
of presentation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KSIX Media Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings ), a Nevada
corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Ksix Media, Inc. ( Media ), a Nevada corporation, Ksix, LLC ( KSIX ),
a Nevada limited liability company that was formed on September 14, 2011, Blvd. Media Group, LLC ( BMG ), a Nevada
limited liability company that was formed on January 29, 2009, DigitizeIQ, LLC ( DIQ ) an Illinois limited liability
company that was formed on July 23, 2014 and North American Exploration, Inc. ( NAE ), a Nevada corporation that was
incorporated on August 18, 2006 (collectively the  Company ). All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.  

On
October 12, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Common Stock ( Agreement ) with DIQ and
its sole owner. DIQ is a full service digital advertising agency which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  

On
or about April 27, 2015, KSIX Media Holdings, Inc. (formerly  North American Energy Resources, Inc. ) entered into
a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Agreement ) with all of the shareholders of KSIX Media, Inc. whose primary business
is the operation of a diverse advertising network through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, KSIX and BMG. Pursuant to the Agreement,
the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares (22,600,000 shares) of the common stock of KSIX Media, Inc. from
its shareholders in exchange for 28,000,000 restricted shares of its common stock. In July 2015, the Company completed the change
of its name from North American Energy Resources, Inc. to KSIX Media Holdings, Inc.  

The
Agreement was accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby KSIX Media, Inc. is the accounting acquirer and KSIX Media Holdings,
Inc. is the legal surviving reporting company. The historical financial statements represent those of KSIX Media, Inc. which was
formed on November 5, 2014.  

On
December 23, 2014, Media acquired the membership interests of KSIX and BMG.  

Prior
to the consummation of the stock exchange agreement, North American Energy Resources, Inc. had an April 30 year end and KSIX Media,
Inc. had a December 31 year end. The board of directors elected to change the year end to December 31 and assumed the fiscal year
end of KSIX Media, Inc.  

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10
of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain
all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual
financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
contain all of the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the
Company as of June 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year
or any future period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and related notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed
with the SEC on April 14, 2016.

2     ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Fair
Value Measurements    

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value
as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair
value measurements.  

The
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature
of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective
yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest rates taken together with other features such as concurrent issuances
of warrants and/or embedded conversion options, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk.  

ASC
820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may
be used to measure fair value:  

Level
    1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level
    2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable.   

Level
    3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions).   

The
derivative liability in connection with the conversion feature of the convertible debt, classified as a Level 3 liability, is
the only financial liability measure at fair value on a recurring basis.  

The
change in the Level 3 financial instrument is as follows:  

The
estimated fair value of the derivative instruments was valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following
assumptions as of September 30, 2016:  

Estimated Dividends    
         None      
 
     Expected Volatility    
        75  %  
 
     Risk Free Interest Rate    
        3.50  %  
 
     Expected Term    
         9-18 months      

Convertible
Instruments    

The
Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives
and Hedging Activities . Applicable GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments
and account for them as freestanding derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances
in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related
to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative
instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings
as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative
instrument.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

We
have evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements as issued by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU )
through the date these financial statements were available to be issued and find no recent accounting pronouncements that would
have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company.  

3
GOING CONCERN   

The
Company s financial statements have been presented on the basis that it continues as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company has not established sources of revenues sufficient to fund the development of its business, or to pay projected operating
expenses and commitments for the next year. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $4,022,179 from inception through September
30, 2016, and incurred a loss of $2,594,373 for the nine months then ended. These factors, among others, create an uncertainty
about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company projects that it should be
cash flow positive by the end of the 3rd quarter ended September 30, 2016 from ongoing operations by the combination of increased
cash flow from its current subsidiaries, as well as restructuring our current debt burden. The Company has executed an agreement
with a FINRA licensed broker, as well as several institutional investors, to bring in equity investments to pay down existing
debt obligations, cover short term shortfalls, and complete proposed acquisitions. Additionally, the Company is negotiating the
closing of the acquisition of True Wireless, LLC, ( True ) an Oklahoma Limited Liability Company. Upon the completion
of the potential acquisition of True as a wholly owned subsidiary, the Company will become cash flow positive. Management can
provide no assurance that the Company will be able to produce positive cash flow or obtain the financing as described.  The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the success of this plan.

ACQUISITIONS   

(a)    On
                                         April 27, 2015, Holdings (formerly North American Energy Resources, Inc., the Registrant)
                                         entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Agreement ) with all of the
                                         shareholders of Media. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company acquired the 22,600,000
                                         issued and outstanding shares of Media and issued 28,000,000 restricted shares of the
                                         Company s common stock in exchange. The transaction resulted in the shareholders
                                         of Media owning approximately 90% of the resulting outstanding shares at that time and
                                         accordingly, the transaction is accounted for as a reverse merger with Media being the
                                         accounting survivor of the Company.   

(b)    On
                                         October 12, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Common Stock
                                         ( Agreement ) with DIQ and its sole owner. DIQ, whose primary business operation
                                         is a full service digital advertising agency specializing in survey generation and landing
                                         page optimization specifically designed for mass tort action lawsuits, became a wholly
                                         owned subsidiary of the Company. The consideration included 1,250,000 shares of the Company s
                                         common stock, a cash payment of $250,000 and three $250,000 notes (see Note 9)    

The
Company has estimated the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition and is currently
undergoing a formal valuation and will adjust these estimates, if necessary, within the one year measurement period:  

Operating
results of DIQ for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 follow:  

5     INTANGIBLE ASSETS   

KSIX
and BMG - The customer lists and related contracts of KSIX and BMG were recorded at their fair value of $1,143,162 upon their
acquisition on December 23, 2014. The Company has determined a useful life of existing contracts and customer lists of three years
and is amortizing the cost over that period.  

DIQ
- The customer lists and related contracts of DIQ were recorded at their fair value of $1,630,973 upon their acquisition on October
12, 2015. The Company has estimated the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition and
is currently undergoing a formal valuation and will adjust these estimates, if necessary, within the one year measurement period.
(Note 4). The Company has determined a useful life of existing contracts and customer lists of three years and is amortizing the
cost over that period.  

Intangible
assets are as follows:  

6     DEFERRED REVENUE   

The
Company bills in advance for services to be rendered for the majority of the business of DIQ. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company had received $180,000 and $518,240, respectively, from its customers for which services had yet to be delivered.  

7     CREDIT CARD LIABILITY   

The
Company maintains an arrangement with its bank for its DIQ operation, whereby it utilizes credit cards to pay the majority of
its trade obligations. The bank charges no interest on the outstanding credit card balance, which is required to be repaid at
the end of each billing cycle. In the event the payment is not timely made, the bank charges a fee equal to 2% of the outstanding
balance. The Company s credit limit is approximately $500,000. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s
credit card liability was $341,726 and $274,135, respectively.  

8     NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT   RELATED PARTIES   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, notes payable and long-term debt due to related parties consists of:  

The
payment due April 28, 2016 has not been paid.  

9     NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, notes payable and long-term debt consists of:  

The  Convertible Promissory Note  was modified to release the pledge of the holder s former membership units in Ksix
and BMG, to make the note convertible into the Company s common stock and to require an extra payment of $100,000 due within
90 days. The terms of the Convertible Note provided in the event the Note was not paid prior to the Maturity Date (January 1,
2017) or that payments are not made to the holder by the due date ($10,000 on the 1 st  and 15 th  of each month),
the holder shall have the right thereafter, exercisable in whole or in part, to convert the outstanding principal or payment then
due into shares of the common stock of the Company. The Convertible Promissory Note provided the note conversion price was determined
by taking the lowest closing price of the Company s common stock in the previous ten trading days and then applying a 45%
discount. On March 23, 2016, the parties entered into an Addendum to the Convertible Promissory Note to allow an immediate conversion
of the $20,000 payments due in April 2016 at the 45% discount rate; to modify the conversion discount rate from 45% to 35% for
any future conversions; and to require an additional payment of $30,000 within sixty days. The Company evaluated the embedded
conversion feature for derivative treatment and recorded the following.  

The
original note and the convertible promissory note provide for semi-monthly payments of $10,000 due on the 1 st  and 15 th
 of the month, with any unpaid balance due on January 1, 2017. If the Company paid the unpaid balance on December 31, 2016,
they were allowed a discount of $200,000 from the remaining balance. In addition, the modification and addendum, provided for
two additional payments during 2016. Within 90 days of January 19, 2016, the Company was required to make an additional payment
of $100,000 and within 60 days of March 23, 2016, the Company was required to make an additional payment of $30,000.  As of
September 30, 2016, the $100,000 and the $30,000 extra payments have not been made and seven payments of $10,000 are past due.   

Notes due seller of DigitizeIQ, LLC includes a series of notes as follows :  

The
$250,000 notes due January 12, 2016 and March 12, 2016 have an unpaid balance of $485,000 at September 30, 2016. The Company is
renegotiating the terms of the notes. The notes bear interest at 5% per annum when in default (after the due date).  

The
notes were non-interest bearing until due. Accordingly, a debt discount at 5% per annum was calculated for the notes and was amortized
to interest expense until the due date of the notes. The net carrying value of the notes follows.  

SENIOR
SECURED CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT   

On
February 24, 2016, the Company executed a Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement ( Senior Credit Facility ) in the
maximum amount of $5,000,000 together with a Convertible Promissory Note ( Convertible Note ) in the amount of $750,000
with TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP ( TCA ). The initial loan advance was $400,000 and requires monthly interest
only payments for two months and then sixteen monthly payments of $28,306, including interest at 18% per annum. The obligation
is secured by substantially all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The payment due Augsust 29, 2016 was acquired by Salksanna
LLC on September 13, 2016 (See   below). The payment due September 29, 2016 was acquired by Salksanna, LLC on October 7,
2016. See Note 12.  

The
Senior Credit Facility includes a provision for advisory fees in the amount of $300,000 which was paid when the Company issued
1,782,000 shares of its common stock to TCA (the  Advisory Shares ) on or about March 24, 2016. If TCA is unable to
collect the $300,000 from sales of the Advisory Shares within twelve months, the Company is obligated to issue additional shares
to TCA until TCA is able to collect the full $300,000. Should TCA still be unable to collect the full $300,000, and after at least
one year, TCA can require the Company to redeem any remaining shares for an amount equal to $300,000 less the sales proceeds that
TCA has collected. In the event TCA sells the Advisory Shares for more than $300,000, the excess proceeds, together with unsold
common shares will be returned to the Company. As long as there is no default under the terms of the Senior Credit Facility, TCA
is limited to weekly sales of the Advisory Shares equal to no more than 20% of the average weekly volume of the Company s
common stock on its principal trading market. The stock was valued at the trading price on the date of the agreement and the resulting
$300,000 was included as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability and is being amortized to interest
expense over the eighteen month loan payment period.  

The
Convertible Note is convertible into the Common Stock of the Company upon the event of: (1) a default under any of the loan documents
between the Company and TCA; or (2) mutual agreement between the Company and TCA, at which time TCA may convert all or a portion
of the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest into shares of the Common Stock of the Company calculated by the conversion
amount divided by 85% of the lowest of the daily weighted average price of the Company s Common Stock during five business
days immediately prior to the date of the request of conversion (the  Conversion ). Pursuant to the terms of the Convertible
Note, TCA is limited to beneficial ownership of not more than 4.99% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Company
after taking into effect the Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Conversion.  

Pursuant
to ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
Issuance Costs  and issued by the FASB in April 2015, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability should
be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt
discounts. The carrying value of the note at September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

The
Company is also responsible for other transaction, due diligence and legal fees of $42,500 if it draws the remaining $350,000
initially committed.  

The
proceeds from the loan were used to pay a $250,000 note to the seller of DIQ and for working capital.

 Pinz Capital International, L.P. Note    The Pinz Capital note payable is due in installments of $25,000 plus accrued
interest on November 25, 2016; $18,750 plus accrued interest on December 25, 2016; $14,063 plus accrued interest on January 25,
2017 and a final payment of the unpaid balance plus accrued interest on May 25, 2017. A prepayment before November 25, 2016 would
require a 5% prepayment penalty. The agreement provides for limitations on additional indebtedness. If an event of default, as
defined in the agreement, occurs and if not cured within ten days, the note becomes convertible into the Company s common
stock at a rate equal to 65% of the average VWAP over the previous 5 trading days. If the event of default is for non-payment
of any installment due, the amount convertible is limited to the amount of the unpaid installment. Prinz Capital is controlled
by a director of the Company.  

5
 The convertible promissory note  was determined to have a beneficial conversion feature which is being amortized to interest
expense over the nine month term of the loan. The note is summarized as follows:  

The
Company has entered into a number of agreements with River North Equity, LLC ( RNE ) wherein RNE has agreed to invest
up to $3,000,000 in the common stock of the Company. These agreements require an effective Registration Statement to be on file
by the Company and would allow the Company to require RNE to purchase the Company s common stock at 90% of the lowest trading
price of the Company s common stock during the previous five trading days. The Company has not yet filed a Registration
Statement with the SEC.  

6
 The convertible promissory note  dated September 13, 2016 is convertible into common stock at a 30% discount to the lowest
trading price in the most recent twenty trading days plus other discounts if applicable. The convertible note replaces a payment
due to TCA on August 29, 2016. The note includes loan cost and the carrying value is summarized as follows:  

Derivative
liability   

The
Company has determined that the conversion feature embedded in the notes referred to above that contain a potential variable conversion
amount constitutes a derivative which has been bifurcated from the note and recorded as a derivative liability, with a corresponding
discount recorded to the associated debt. The excess of the derivative value over the face amount of the note, if any, is recorded
immediately to interest expense at inception. The above notes are presented net of an initial discount of $363,315 at September
30, 2016 and $0 at December 31, 2015, on the accompanying balance sheet.

COMPARISON
OF THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015   

Revenues
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:   

KSIX
provides performance based marketing solutions to drive traffic and conversions within a Cost-Per-Action ( CPA ) business
model. KSIX works directly with advertisers and other networks to promote advertiser campaigns through their affiliates. BMG works
with online games and web publishers utilizing our proprietary Offer Wall that promotes hundreds of different advertiser s
campaigns on a single web page. KSIX and BMG revenues amounted to $302,733 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $357,557 in the 2015 period. The majority of the decline began in the 2015 period when the Company lost a major customer. In
addition, BMG is not active at September 30, 2016.  

DIQ s
revenues from survey generation and landing page optimization amounted to $216,481 in the three months ended September 30, 2016.
DIQ was acquired October 12, 2015 and accordingly, its revenues for the period ended September 30, 2015 were not a part of the
Company s consolidated revenue. DIQ s revenue in the 2015 period was $768,465 while a private company. The decline
in revenue is primarily a result of training new personnel to operate DIQ s business and developing new customers.  

Cost
of revenue increased $102,070 (55.7%) in the 2016 quarter as compared to the same 2015 period. This compares to an overall increase
in revenues of $161,658 (45.2%). Cost of revenue was 55.0% of sales in the 2016 quarter as compared to 51.3% in the 2015 quarter.
During the previous quarter, DIQ incurred cost on a project for which they were only able to receive a minor return, which resulted
in the higher than expected cost of revenue (85.6% in the second quarter).  

Costs
and expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:   

Depreciation
and amortization increased $136,425 (142.4%) from $95,680 in the 2015 quarter to $231,925 in the 2016 quarter. Substantially all
of the increase is the amortization of intangible assets of $135,915 acquired as a part of the DIQ acquisition on October 12,
2015.  

Selling,
general and administrative expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:   

Total
selling, general and administrative expense increased $255,214 (96.8%) from $263,669 in the 2015 period to $518,883 in the 2016
period. DIQ is included in the 2016 period, but is not included in the 2015 period. The detail changes are discussed below:  

Other
expense (income) during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:   

Interest
expense in the 2015 period was the interest on an amortizing BMG note. During the 2016 period, interest expense includes $50,783
in amortization of loan costs, $187,910in OID and amortization of debt discount and $26,385 in current accrued interest on the
notes payable described in Notes 8 and 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

The
Company has determined that the conversion feature embedded in the notes referred to in Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements that contain a potential variable conversion amount constitutes a derivative which has been bifurcated from the note
and recorded as a derivative liability, with a corresponding discount recorded to the associated debt. The excess of the derivative
value over the face amount of the note, if any, is recorded immediately to interest expense at inception. A loss of $96,810 was
calculated and recorded at September 30, 2016 based on the value of the derivative liability at that date.  

COMPARISON
OF NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015   

Revenues
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following:   

KSIX
provides performance based marketing solutions to drive traffic and conversions within a Cost-Per-Action ( CPA ) business
model. KSIX works directly with advertisers and other networks to promote advertiser campaigns through their affiliates. BMG works
with online games and web publishers utilizing our proprietary Offer Wall that promotes hundreds of different advertiser s
campaigns on a single web page. KSIX and BMG revenues amounted to $961,717 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $1,874,872 in the 2015 period. The majority of the decline began in the 2015 period when the Company lost a major customer.
In addition, BMG is not active at September 30, 2016 and had only nominal revenues in 2016.  

DIQ s
revenues from survey generation and landing page optimization amounted to $1,952,084 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
DIQ was acquired October 12, 2015 and accordingly, its revenues for the period ended September 30, 2015 were not a part of the
Company s consolidated revenue. DIQ s revenue in the 2015 period was $3,675,005 while a private company. The decline
in revenue is primarily a result of training new personnel to operate DIQ s business and developing new customers.  

Cost
of revenue increased $933,759 (79.0%) in the 2016 period as compared to the same 2015 period. This compares to an overall increase
in revenues of $1,038,929 (55.4%). Cost of revenue was 72.6% of sales in the 2016 period as compared to 63.0% in the 2015 period.
The higher cost of revenue is primarily due to the impact of DIQ. DIQ s cost of revenue was 83.6%, while KSIX and BMG were
50.3% in the current year. During the previous quarter, DIQ incurred cost on a project for which they were only able to receive
a minor return, which resulted in the higher than expected cost of revenue (85.6% in the second quarter).  

Costs
and expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:   

Depreciation
and amortization increased $408,860 (142.5%) from $286,917 in the 2015 period to $695,777 in the 2016 period. Substantially all
of the increase is the amortization of intangible assets of $407,745 acquired as a part of the DIQ acquisition on October 12,
2015.  

Selling,
general and administrative expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:   

Total
selling, general and administrative expense increased $1,431,274 (178.5%) from $801,648 in the 2015 period to $2,232,922 in the
2016 period. DIQ is included in the 2016 period, but is not included in the 2015 period. The detail changes are discussed below:  

Other
expense (income) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:   

Interest
expense in the 2015 period was the interest on an amortizing BMG note. During the 2016 period, interest expense includes $120,325
in amortization of loan costs, $190,770in OID and amortization of debt discount and $62,419 in current accrued interest on the
notes payable described in Notes 8 and 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The majority of the loan cost was
paid with the Company s common stock.  

The
Company has determined that the conversion feature embedded in the notes referred to in Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements that contain a potential variable conversion amount constitutes a derivative which has been bifurcated from the note
and recorded as a derivative liability, with a corresponding discount recorded to the associated debt. The excess of the derivative
value over the face amount of the note, if any, is recorded immediately to interest expense at inception. A loss of $96,810 was
calculated and recorded at September 30, 2016 based on the value of the derivative liability at that date.  

Other
income includes a bad debt recovery in the 2016 period of $5,844.  

LIQUIDITY,
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND GOING CONCERN   

The
Company has entered into loan agreements to finance the purchase of the operating businesses of DIQ, KSIX and BMG and is currently
selling common stock to assist in reducing and retiring this debt and to meet any operational shortfalls.  

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our current assets were $529,386and $346,043, respectively, and our current liabilities
were $2,951,053 and $2,597,008, respectively, which resulted in a working capital deficit of $2,421,667 and $2,250,965, respectively.  

Total
assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to $2,114,389 and $2,626,823, respectively. At September 30, 2016,
assets consisted of current assets of $529,386, net property and equipment of $12,179 and net intangible assets of $1,572,824,
as compared to current assets of $346,043, net property and equipment of $14,422 and net intangible assets of $2,266,358 at December
31, 2015.  

At
September 30, 2016, our total liabilities of $3,377,721 increased $144,151 from $3,233,570 at December 31, 2015. The increase
consists of a decrease in long-term debt of $530,618 offset by an increase in current liabilities of $674,769.  

At
September 30, 2016, our stockholders  deficit was ($1,263,332) as compared to a stockholders  deficit of ($606,747)
at December 31, 2015. The principal reason for the increase in stockholders  deficit was the loss from operations of $2,594,373
less the common and preferred stock issued, warrants issued and beneficial conversion feature of convertible debt in the total
amount of $1,937,788.  

The
following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had the following material commitments and contingencies.  

Acquisition
   See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Notes
payable and long-term debt  - $1,459,697 - See Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Advances
from related party  - $357,002 balance owed on non-interest bearing basis. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Cash
requirements and capital expenditures    The Company has not had any capital expenditures during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, which required cash. On October 12, 2015, the Company acquired DigitizeIQ, LLC for cash in the amount of $250,000
and $750,000 in short-term notes payable. On February 24, 2016, the Company borrowed $400,000 and used $250,000 of this amount
to retire $250,000 of the debt incurred to acquire DIQ. $485,000 remains unpaid. The Company does plan to use acquisitions to
grow its revenue base through use of its common stock, debt financing and available cash. The Company has initiated efforts to
raise the required capital, however, there can be no assurance that it will be successful, or that any capital can be raised on
terms that are not dilutive to existing common stockholders.  

Known
trends and uncertainties    The Company is planning to acquire other businesses that are similar to its operations. The
uncertainty of the economy may increase the difficulty of raising funds to support the planned business expansion.  

Evaluation
of the amounts and certainty of cash flows    The loss of a major customer during the second quarter of 2015 has reduced
cash flows from operations. The Company is still learning the business of DIQ and has experienced operating losses during the
initial operation. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace the lost business and be able to fund operations
in the future.  

Going
Concern    The Company s financial statements have been presented on the basis that it continues as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not
include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company has not established sources of revenues sufficient to fund the development of its business, or to pay projected operating
expenses and commitments for the next year. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $4,022,179 from inception through September
30, 2016, and incurred a loss of $2,594,373 for the nine months then ended. These factors, among others, create an uncertainty
about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company projects that it should be
cash flow positive by the end of the 3rd quarter ended September 30, 2016 from ongoing operations by the combination of increased
cash flow from its current subsidiaries, as well as restructuring our current debt burden. The Company has executed an agreement
with a FINRA licensed broker, as well as several institutional investors, to bring in equity investments to pay down existing
debt obligations, cover short term shortfalls, and complete proposed acquisitions. Additionally, the Company is negotiating the
closing of the acquisition of True Wireless, LLC, ( True ) an Oklahoma Limited Liability Company. Upon the completion
of the potential acquisition of True as a wholly owned subsidiary, the Company will become cash flow positive. Management can
provide no assurance that the Company will be able to produce positive cash flow or obtain the financing as described.  The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the success of this plan.  

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to investors.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES   

Our
significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the period ending September
30, 2016, we were not required to make any material estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures
of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. However, if we complete an acquisition, we will be required to make estimates and
assumptions typical of other companies. For example, we will be required to make critical accounting estimates related to valuation
and accounting for business combinations. The estimates will require us to rely upon assumptions that were highly uncertain at
the time the accounting estimates are made, and changes in them are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Changes
in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements in the future. Our estimates
will be based on our experience and our interpretation of economic, political, regulatory, and other factors that affect our business
prospects. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.  

Item
3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Not
applicable.  

Item
4: Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures   

Under
the PCAOB standards, a control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,
in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A significant
deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe
than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit the attention by those responsible for oversight of the company s
financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016. Our
management has determined that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective
due to a lack of segregation of duties, lack of an audit committee, and lack of documented controls.  

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting    

Effective
April 27, 2015, the Company experienced a change in control, whereby, the Company s new Chief Executive officer, through
a stock exchange agreement acquired approximately 79% of the Company s outstanding common stock. As a result, the Company s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer determined that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to a lack of segregation of duties, lack of an audit committee and lack of documented controls. There have
been no other significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls during
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

                                         in this report any change in the registrant s internal controls over financial
                                         reporting that occurred during the registrant s current fiscal quarter (the registrant s
                                         fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
                                         or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
                                         over financial reporting; and;    

5.    I

                                         controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability
                                         to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
