GRACO INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  1.  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The consolidated balance sheet of Graco Inc. and Subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of   September 23, 2016   and the related statements of earnings and comprehensive income for the three and   nine months   ended   September 23, 2016   and   September 25, 2015  , and cash flows for the   nine months   ended   September 23, 2016   and   September 25, 2015   have been prepared by the Company and have not been audited. 
    
  In the opinion of management, these consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of   September 23, 2016  , and the results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented. 
    
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. Therefore, these statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that will be realized for the full fiscal year. 

2.  Earnings per Share 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

Stock options to purchase   1,034,000   and   1,391,000   shares were not included in the   September 23, 2016   and   September 25, 2015   computations of diluted earnings per share, respectively, because they would have been anti-dilutive.

3.  Share-Based Awards 
    
  Options on common shares granted and outstanding, as well as the weighted average exercise price, are shown below (in thousands, except exercise prices): 

The Company recognized year-to-date share-based compensation of   $16.1 million   in   2016   and   $15.5 million   in   2015  . As of   September 23, 2016  , there was   $9.5 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   2.2 years  . 
    
  The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions and results: 

Under the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company issued   170,000   shares in   2016   and   166,000   shares in   2015  . The fair value of the employees  purchase rights under this Plan was estimated on the date of grant. The benefit of the   15 percent   discount from the lesser of the fair market value per common share on the first day and the last day of the plan year was added to the fair value of the employees  purchase rights determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions and results:

8.  Intangible Assets 
    
  Information related to other intangible assets follows (dollars in thousands):   

Amortization of intangibles for the quarter was   $4.6 million   in   2016   and   $4.4 million   in   2015   and for the year-to-date was   $14.3 million   in   2016   and   $12.9 million   in   2015  .  Estimated annual amortization expense is as follows:   $18.7 million     in   2016  ,     $18.6 million   in   2017  ,   $18.5 million   in   2018  ,   $18.0 million   in   2019  ,   $17.9 million   in   2020  , and   $90.7 million   thereafter. 
    
  Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill in   2016   were as follows (in thousands):  

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. In completing the goodwill impairment analysis for 2015, the estimated fair value of all reporting units substantially exceeded carrying value except for our Oil and Natural Gas reporting unit ( ONG ), which exceeded its carrying value by   14 percent  . In 2016, operating results of ONG have fallen short of expectations due to weakness in oil and natural gas markets. After considering third quarter operating results and preliminary projections from our 2017 planning process, we concluded that the depth and length of industry weakness, and its continuing impact on ONG results, were greater than previously expected. Consequently, we initiated an impairment analysis at the end of the third quarter. Preliminary analysis indicated potential impairment of ONG goodwill as of   September 23, 2016  . Due to the amount of time and effort required to determine the implied fair value of ONG goodwill, we are unable to provide a reasonable estimate or a range of estimates for the potential non-cash impairment charge at this time. The carrying value of ONG goodwill was   $147 million   and the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets of ONG totaled   $73 million   as of   September 23, 2016  . The valuation to determine the amount of impairment will be completed in the fourth quarter.

    Other Current Liabilities 
     Components of other current liabilities were (in thousands):   

A liability is established for estimated future warranty and service claims that relate to current and prior period sales. The Company estimates warranty costs based on historical claim experience and other factors including evaluating specific product warranty issues.  Following is a summary of activity in accrued warranty and service liabilities (in thousands): 

The Company manages certain self-insured loss exposures through a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary established in 2015.  At   September 23, 2016  , cash balances of   $9 million   were restricted to funding of the captive's loss reserves. Restricted cash is included within other current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 

10.  Fair Value 
    
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and fair value measurement level were as follows (in thousands): 

Contracts insuring the lives of certain employees who are eligible to participate in certain non-qualified pension and deferred compensation plans are held in trust. Cash surrender value of the contracts is based on performance measurement funds that shadow the deferral investment allocations made by participants in certain deferred compensation plans. The deferred compensation liability balances are valued based on amounts allocated by participants to the underlying performance measurement funds. 

12 

     Table of Contents  

Contingent consideration liability represents the estimated value (using a probability-weighted expected return approach) of future payments to be made to previous owners of an acquired business based on future revenues.  
    
  Long-term notes payable with fixed interest rates have a carrying amount of   $300 million   and an estimated fair value of   $335 million   as of   September 23, 2016   and   $320 million   as of   December 25, 2015  . The fair value of variable rate borrowings approximates carrying value. The Company uses significant other observable inputs to estimate fair value (level 2 of the fair value hierarchy) based on the present value of future cash flows and rates that would be available for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. 

11.  Divestiture in 2015 
    
  In the second quarter of 2015, the Company sold the Liquid Finishing business assets that were held as a cost-method investment.  The   $149 million   pre-tax gain, net of transaction and other related expenses, was included in investment income in the Company's consolidated statements of earnings.  Net earnings for the third quarter of 2015 included after-tax net gain from post-closing purchase price adjustments of   $2 million   and year-to-date after-tax gain and dividends totaling   $141 million  .  Prior to the sale, income was recognized on dividends received from after-tax earnings of Liquid Finishing and also included in investment income.  Net earnings in 2015 included   no   dividend income for the quarter and   $42 million   for the year-to-date.   

12.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a final standard on accounting for leases. The new standard is effective for the Company in fiscal 2019 and requires most leases to be recorded on the balance sheet.  The Company is evaluating the effect of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and accounting systems. 
    
  In March 2016, FASB issued a new standard that changes the accounting for share-based payments.  The standard is effective for the Company in fiscal 2017 and early adoption is permitted. It simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payments, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and classification in the statement of cash flows.  Under the new standard, excess tax benefits on the exercise of stock options currently credited to equity will reduce the current tax provision, potentially creating volatility in the Company's effective tax rate. The Company is evaluating the effect of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and will adopt for fiscal 2017.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 
    
  The Company designs, manufactures and markets systems and equipment to move, measure, control, dispense and spray fluid and coating materials. Management classifies the Company s business into three reportable segments: Industrial, Process and Contractor. Key strategies include developing and marketing new products, leveraging products and technologies into additional, growing end-user markets, expanding distribution globally and completing strategic acquisitions that provide additional channel and technologies.   
    
  The following Management s Discussion and Analysis reviews significant factors affecting the Company s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements. 

Consolidated Results 
    
  Net sales, net earnings and earnings per share were as follows (in millions except per share amounts and percentages): 

Net earnings in 2015 included net investment income from the Liquid Finishing businesses sold in the second quarter of 2015.  Results excluding Liquid Finishing investment income and expense provide a more consistent base of comparison of ongoing financial results. A calculation of the non-GAAP measurement of net earnings excluding investment income and expense follows (in millions except per share amounts):

The following table presents components of changes in sales: 

(1)    North and South America, including the United States 
       (2)    Europe, Middle East and Africa 

Sales by geographic area were as follows (in millions): 

Changes in currency translation rates had no significant effect on results for the quarter, and decreased year-to-date sales and net earnings by approximately $9 million and $2 million, respectively. 
    
  Sales for the quarter increased 3 percent, with 2 percent increases in the Americas and EMEA and a 4 percent increase in Asia Pacific. Incremental sales from operations acquired within the last 12 months totaled $4 million, contributing 1 percentage point of growth. Organic sales at consistent translation rates increased 2 percent, with increases in all regions.  
    
  Sales for the year to date increased 2 percent, driven by a 6 percent increase in EMEA. Incremental sales from operations acquired within the last 12 months totaled $15 million, contributing 2 percentage points of growth. Organic sales at consistent translation rates increased 1 percent, with increases of 5 percent in EMEA and 2 percent in Asia Pacific. 
    
  Gross profit margin rates were slightly higher for the quarter and flat for the year to date. The favorable effects of realized pricing and product and channel mix offset the unfavorable impacts of lower factory volume. Gross margin rate for the year to date also included the favorable impact of reduced acquisition-related purchase accounting effects. 
    
  Total operating expenses for the quarter were $2 million (2 percent) higher than the third quarter last year, including $2 million of incremental expenses of acquired operations. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $3 million, mostly from changes in market-driven components of pension and stock compensation. Total operating expenses for the year to date were $16 million (6 percent) higher than the comparable period last year, including $7 million of incremental expenses of acquired operations.

     Table of Contents  

The effective income tax rate for the quarter was 29 percent, 2 percentage points lower than the comparable period last year.  The 2016 rate included the impact of the federal R D credit that was not available until the fourth quarter of 2015, and the favorable effect of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than in the U.S. The effective rate for the year to date was 30 percent, 3 percentage points higher than the comparable period last year.  Last year's rate included the favorable impact of non-recurring tax benefits, mostly related to a change in assertion as to reinvestment of foreign earnings, and the impact of post-tax dividend income, partially offset by the tax rate effect of the gain on the sale of the Liquid Finishing assets. 
    
  Goodwill Impairment Analysis 
    
  In 2016, operating results of our Oil and Natural Gas reporting unit ("ONG") within the Process segment have fallen short of expectations due to weakness in oil and natural gas markets. After considering third quarter operating results and preliminary projections from our 2017 planning process, we concluded that the depth and length of industry weakness, and its continuing impact on ONG results, were greater than previously expected. While management is committed to long-term profitability in ONG, and believes its investment in facility improvements, manufacturing capabilities and commercial resources have positioned the unit to benefit strongly from a recovery when it occurs, we initiated an impairment analysis at the end of the third quarter. Preliminary analysis indicated potential impairment of ONG goodwill as of   September 23, 2016  . Due to the amount of time and effort required to determine the implied fair value of ONG goodwill, we are unable to provide a reasonable estimate or a range of estimates for the potential non-cash impairment charge at this time. The carrying value of ONG goodwill was   $147 million   and the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets of ONG totaled $73 million as of   September 23, 2016  . The valuation to determine the amount of impairment will be completed in the fourth quarter.  

Segment Results 
    
  Certain measurements of segment operations compared to last year are summarized below: 
    
  Industrial   

Industrial segment sales for the quarter decreased 1 percent. An increase of 8 percent in Asia Pacific offset decreases of 4 percent in the Americas and 3 percent in EMEA. Year-to-date sales increased 1 percent (2 percent at consistent translation rates), including increases of 5 percent in EMEA (6 percent at consistent translation rates) and 7 percent in Asia Pacific (8 percent at consistent translation rates), partially offset by a decrease of 4 percent in the Americas.  Operating margin rates for the Industrial segment were slightly higher than last year.

     Table of Contents  

Process 

Process segment sales for the quarter increased 4 percent (5 percent at consistent translation rates), including increases of 5 percent in the Americas and 4 percent in Asia Pacific. Sales were flat in EMEA, but increased 7 percent at consistent translation rates. Year-to-date sales in this segment were down 4 percent (3 percent at consistent translation rates), including decreases of 3 percent in the Americas, 4 percent in EMEA (flat at consistent translation rates) and 8 percent in Asia Pacific (6 percent at consistent translation rates). Operating margin rate recovered in the third quarter with higher sales volume and improved gross margin rate.  For the year to date, operating margin rate decreased compared to last year due to lower sales volume and unfavorable expense leverage.   
    
  Contractor 

Contractor segment sales for the quarter increased 7 percent, with increases of 7 percent in the Americas and 20 percent in EMEA, partially offset by a decrease of 11 percent in Asia Pacific. Year-to-date sales increased 7 percent, with increases of 6 percent in the Americas and 17 percent in EMEA, partially offset by a 6 percent decrease in Asia Pacific. Operating margin rates decreased slightly compared to last year due to unfavorable expense leverage and product and channel mix. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities through the first nine months of 2016 was $202 million, compared to $135 million in the same period of 2015.  Net cash from operating activities in 2015 was affected by increases in accounts receivables balances from growth in business activity, build up of inventory levels to improve customer service and transaction costs related to the sale of Liquid Finishing business assets.  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company used proceeds from borrowings under its revolving line of credit to complete acquisitions of two related businesses that were not material to the consolidated financial statements.  Other significant uses of cash in 2016 included share repurchases of $48 million (partially offset by $26 million of proceeds from shares issued), cash dividends of $55 million and property, plant and equipment additions of $34 million.  In 2015, proceeds of $610 million from the sale of Liquid Finishing assets were principally used to retire debt.  
    
  At   September 23, 2016  , cash balances of $9 million were restricted to funding of certain self-insured loss reserves. Restricted cash is included within other current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

     Table of Contents  

At   September 23, 2016  , the Company had various lines of credit totaling $547 million, of which $484 million was unused. Internally generated funds and unused financing sources are expected to provide the Company with the flexibility to meet its liquidity needs in 2016. 

Outlook 
    
  We are holding to our outlook of low single-digit sales growth for Graco worldwide for the full year 2016. The Industrial segment continues to experience a spotty environment for capital equipment spending worldwide, with ongoing weakness most notable in the Americas region. Construction activity remains solid in the EMEA and Americas regions. While the Process segment saw modest growth sequentially in the third quarter, we are cautious about ongoing headwinds. Regionally, we anticipate the Americas region will finish the full year 2016 flat compared with the prior year, below our prior outlook of low single-digit growth. In the EMEA region, we reiterate our low-to-mid single-digit growth expectations for the full year. Our outlook for the Asia Pacific region continues to be low single-digit growth for 2016. The fourth quarter of 2015 was the highest growth quarter of the year, with 6 percent growth on an organic, constant currency basis, providing a difficult comparable for the last quarter of the year.  
    
  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  The Company desires to take advantage of the  safe harbor  provisions regarding forward-looking statements of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is filing this Cautionary Statement in order to do so.  From time to time various forms filed by our Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and Form 8-Ks, and other disclosures, including our 2015 Overview report, press releases, earnings releases, analyst briefings, conference calls and other written documents or oral statements released by our Company, may contain forward-looking statements.

  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
    
  As of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.

Based upon that evaluation, they concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

PART II  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  Except as noted below, there have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors from those disclosed in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Impairment - If acquired businesses do not meet performance expectations, assets acquired could be subject to impairment. 
    
  Our total assets reflect goodwill from acquisitions, representing the excess cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. We test annually whether goodwill has been impaired, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the goodwill may be impaired. If future operating performance at one or more of our operating units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of our acquired businesses were to decline, we could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment in the value of our goodwill would have an adverse non-cash impact on our results of operations and reduce our net worth. In 2016, operating results of our Oil and Natural Gas reporting unit ("ONG") have fallen short of expectations due to weakness in oil and natural gas markets. After considering third quarter operating results and preliminary projections from our 2017 planning process, we concluded that the depth and length of industry weakness, and its continuing impact on ONG results, were greater than previously expected. Consequently, we initiated an impairment analysis at the end of the third quarter. Preliminary analysis indicated potential impairment of ONG goodwill as of September 23, 2016. Due to the amount of time and effort required to determine the implied fair value of ONG goodwill, we are unable to provide a reasonable estimate or a range of estimates for the potential non-cash impairment charge at this time. The carrying value of ONG goodwill was $147 million and the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets of ONG totaled $73 million as of September 23, 2016. The valuation to determine the amount of impairment will be completed in the fourth quarter. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  On April 24, 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of its outstanding common stock, primarily through open-market transactions.  The authorization is for an indefinite period of time or until terminated by the Board. 
    
  In addition to shares purchased under the Board authorizations, the Company purchases shares of common stock held by employees who wish to tender owned shares to satisfy the exercise price or tax due upon exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock. 
    
  No shares were purchased in the third quarter of 2016.  As of   September 23, 2016  , there were 3,852,367 shares that may yet be purchased under the Board authorization.

Graco Reports   Third   Quarter Results 
  Sales Growth and Expense Leverage Drove Earnings Improvement 
  Prior Year to Date Included Non-Recurring Gain 
    
  MINNEAPOLIS (  October 19, 2016  )   - Graco Inc.   (NYSE: GGG)   today announced results for the quarter and nine months ended   September 23, 2016  .  
    
  Summary 
  $ in millions except per share amounts   

  (1) 2015 excludes effect of $2 million for the quarter and $141 million for the year to date, representing net investment income from the Liquid Finishing businesses sold in the second quarter of 2015.  See Consolidated Results below for reconciliation of the adjusted non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP.  
             
    Sales for the quarter increased 3 percent, including 1 percentage point from acquired operations, with increases in all regions.  
                
    Net earnings for the quarter increased 7 percent, with improved gross margin rates and favorable expense leverage. 
                
    Year-to-date net earnings in 2015 included non-recurring income tax benefits totaling $9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share.   
       
  "Solid performance by our Contractor segment was again the primary driver for Graco's growth in the third quarter, with strong execution in the Americas and EMEA," said Patrick J. McHale, Graco's President and CEO. "Industrial segment sales were down slightly, with strong growth in Asia Pacific offset by declines in the Americas and EMEA. Oil and gas headwinds in our Process segment persisted in the quarter, with a year-over-year decline of more than 20 percent. All other major Process segment product categories posted growth in the third quarter against an easier comparable and every Process segment product category grew sequentially from the second quarter. While macroeconomic conditions worldwide are tepid, we remain committed to our long-term strategies to drive growth and sustainable shareholder value."

Consolidated Results 
    
  Changes in currency translation rates had no significant effect on results for the quarter, and decreased year-to-date sales and net earnings by approximately $9 million and $2 million, respectively. 
    
  Sales for the quarter increased 3 percent, with 2 percent increases in the Americas and EMEA and a 4 percent increase in Asia Pacific. Incremental sales from operations acquired within the last 12 months totaled $4 million, contributing 1 percentage point of growth. Organic sales at consistent translation rates increased 2 percent, with increases in all regions.  
    
  Sales for the year to date increased 2 percent, driven by a 6 percent increase in EMEA. Incremental sales from operations acquired within the last 12 months totaled $15 million, contributing 2 percentage points of growth. Organic sales at consistent translation rates increased 1 percent, with increases of 5 percent in EMEA and 2 percent in Asia Pacific. 
    
  Gross profit margin rates were slightly higher for the quarter and flat for the year to date. The favorable effects of realized pricing and product and channel mix offset the unfavorable impacts of lower factory volume. Gross margin rate for the year to date also included the favorable impact of reduced acquisition-related purchase accounting effects. 
    
  Total operating expenses for the quarter were $2 million (2 percent) higher than the third quarter last year, including $2 million of incremental expenses of acquired operations. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $3 million, mostly from changes in market-driven components of pension and stock compensation. Total operating expenses for the year to date were $16 million (6 percent) higher than the comparable period last year, including $7 million of incremental expenses of acquired operations. 
    
  The effective income tax rate for the quarter was 29 percent, 2 percentage points lower than the comparable period last year.  The 2016 rate included the impact of the federal R D credit that was not available until the fourth quarter of 2015, and the favorable effect of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than in the U.S. The effective rate for the year to date was 30 percent, 3 percentage points higher than the comparable period last year.  Last year's rate included the favorable impact of non-recurring tax benefits, mostly related to a change in assertion as to reinvestment of foreign earnings, and the impact of post-tax dividend income, partially offset by the tax rate effect of the gain on the sale of the Liquid Finishing assets. 
    
  Net earnings in 2015 included net investment income from the Liquid Finishing businesses sold in the second quarter of 2015.  Results excluding Liquid Finishing investment income and expense provide a more consistent base of comparison of ongoing financial results. A calculation of the non-GAAP measurement of net earnings excluding investment income and expense follows (in millions except per share amounts):

Goodwill Impairment Analysis 
    
  In 2016, operating results of our Oil and Natural Gas reporting unit ("ONG") within the Process segment have fallen short of expectations due to weakness in oil and natural gas markets.  After considering third quarter operating results and preliminary projections from our 2017 planning process, we concluded that the depth and length of industry weakness, and its continuing impact on ONG results, were greater than previously expected.  While management is committed to long-term profitability in ONG, and believes its investment in facility improvements, manufacturing capabilities and commercial resources have positioned the unit to benefit strongly from a recovery when it occurs, we initiated an impairment analysis at the end of the third quarter.  Preliminary analysis indicated potential impairment of ONG goodwill as of   September 23, 2016  .  Due to the amount of time and effort required to determine the implied fair value of ONG goodwill, we are unable to provide a reasonable estimate or a range of estimates for the potential non-cash impairment charge at this time.  The carrying value of ONG goodwill was   $147 million   and the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets of ONG totaled $73 million as of   September 23, 2016  . The valuation to determine the amount of impairment will be completed in the fourth quarter. 
    
  Segment Results 
    
  Certain measurements of segment operations are summarized below: 

Industrial segment sales for the quarter decreased 1 percent. An increase of 8 percent in Asia Pacific offset decreases of 4 percent in the Americas and 3 percent in EMEA. Year-to-date sales increased 1 percent (2 percent at consistent translation rates), including increases of 5 percent in EMEA (6 percent at consistent translation rates) and 7 percent in Asia Pacific (8 percent at consistent translation rates), partially offset by a decrease of 4 percent in the Americas.  Operating margin rates for the Industrial segment were slightly higher than last year. 
    
  Process segment sales for the quarter increased 4 percent (5 percent at consistent translation rates), including increases of 5 percent in the Americas and 4 percent in Asia Pacific. Sales were flat in EMEA, but increased 7 percent at consistent translation rates. Year-to-date sales in this segment were down 4 percent (3 percent at consistent translation rates), including decreases of 3 percent in the Americas, 4 percent in EMEA (flat at consistent translation rates) and 8 percent in Asia Pacific (6 percent at consistent translation rates). Operating margin rate recovered in the third quarter with higher sales volume and improved gross margin rate.  For the year to date, operating margin rate decreased compared to last year due to lower sales volume and unfavorable expense leverage.

Page 4 GRACO 

Contractor segment sales for the quarter increased 7 percent, with increases of 7 percent in the Americas and 20 percent in EMEA, partially offset by a decrease of 11 percent in Asia Pacific. Year-to-date sales increased 7 percent, with increases of 6 percent in the Americas and 17 percent in EMEA, partially offset by a 6 percent decrease in Asia Pacific. Operating margin rates decreased slightly compared to last year due to unfavorable expense leverage and product and channel mix. 
    
  Outlook 
    
  "We are holding to our outlook of low single-digit sales growth for Graco worldwide for the full year 2016," said McHale. "Our Industrial segment continues to experience a spotty environment for capital equipment spending worldwide, with ongoing weakness most notable in the Americas region. Construction activity remains solid in the EMEA and Americas regions. While our Process segment saw modest growth sequentially in the third quarter, we are cautious about ongoing headwinds. Regionally, we anticipate the Americas region will finish the full year 2016 flat compared with the prior year, below our prior outlook of low single-digit growth. In the EMEA region, we reiterate our low-to-mid single-digit growth expectations for the full year. Our outlook for the Asia Pacific region continues to be low single-digit growth for 2016. The fourth quarter of 2015 was our highest growth quarter of the year, with 6 percent growth on an organic, constant currency basis, providing a difficult comparable for our last quarter of the year."  
    
  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  The Company desires to take advantage of the  safe harbor  provisions regarding forward-looking statements of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is filing this Cautionary Statement in order to do so.

Forward-looking statements are based upon currently available information, but various risks and uncertainties may cause our Company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements in light of new information or future events. 
    
  Future results could differ materially from those expressed due to the impact of changes in various factors.
