CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Form 10-Q )
contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements
contained in this Form 10-Q other than statements of historical
fact, including statements regarding our future results of
operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans,
and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking
statements. The words  believe,   may, 
 will,   estimate,   continue, 
 anticipate,   intend, 
 expect,  and similar expressions are intended to
identify forward-looking statements. We have based these
forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and
projections about future events and trends that we believe may
affect our financial condition, results of operations, business
strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and
objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements
are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
including those described in Part II, Item 1A,  Risk
Factors  in this Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very
competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from
time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all
risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business
or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in
any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these
risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends
discussed in this Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could
differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied
in the forward-looking statements. 

We
undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results
of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as
required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
statements. 

Unless
expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise,
 Company,   we,   us, 
 our,  and  TOMI  refer to TOMI
Environmental Solutions, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiary.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

The
interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
included herein, presented in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles utilized in the United States of America
( GAAP ), and stated in U.S. dollars, have been
prepared by the Company, without an audit, pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are
adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. 

These
financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are
necessary for fair presentation of the information contained
therein. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and
notes thereto which are included in the Form 10-K previously filed
with the SEC on March 30, 2016. The Company follows the same
accounting policies in the preparation of interim
reports. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of TOMI, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, TOMI
Environmental Solutions, Inc., a Nevada Corporation. The
Company s 55% owned subsidiary, TOMI Environmental-China, has
been dormant since its formation in April 2011. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 

Reclassification of Accounts 

Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior-year comparative
financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.
These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported
results of operations or financial position. 

Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially
from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable, fair
values of financial instruments, intangible assets, useful lives of
intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of
stock-based awards, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among
others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of our assets and liabilities. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The
authoritative guidance for fair value measurements defines fair
value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or
the most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal
market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to
transact, and (iv) willing to transact. The guidance describes a
fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs, of which the
first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that
may be used to measure fair value, which are the
following: 

9 

Level
1: 

Quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. 

Level
2: 

Inputs
other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable market
data or substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities. 

Level
3: 

Unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that
are significant to the value of the assets or
liabilities. 

The
Company s financial instruments include cash and equivalents,
accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses. All
these items were determined to be Level 1 fair value
measurements. 

The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents
includes cash on hand held at financial institutions and other
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less. 

Accounts Receivable 

Our
accounts receivable are typically from credit worthy customers or,
for certain international customers, are supported by pre-payments.
For those customers to whom we extend credit, we perform periodic
evaluations of them and maintain allowances for potential credit
losses as deemed necessary. We have a policy of reserving for
doubtful accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of
potential credit losses in existing accounts receivable. We
periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an
allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts
and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an
account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be
uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of
collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is
considered remote. Bad debt expense for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was $50,084 and $155,080, respectively.
Bad debt expense for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015 was $0 and $24,082, respectively. 

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for
doubtful accounts was $200,000 and $45,000,
respectively. 

As
of September 30, 2016, one customer accounted for 12% of accounts
receivable. Three customers accounted for 32% of net revenues for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and two customers
accounted for 26% of net revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. 

As
of December 31, 2015 three customers accounted for 42% of accounts
receivable. Two customers accounted for 30% and 23% of net revenues
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015,
respectively. 

Inventories 

Inventories are
valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out
( FIFO ) method. Inventories consist primarily of
finished goods and raw materials . At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have a reserve
for slow-moving or obsolete inventory.  

Deposits on Merchandise 

Deposits
on merchandise primarily consist of amounts incurred or paid in
advance of the receipt of inventory. (See note 11) 

Property and Equipment 

We
account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated
depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally
three to five years. Depreciation for equipment, furniture and
fixtures and vehicles commences once placed in service for its
intended use. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the lives of the respective leases or
service lives of the improvements, whichever is
shorter. 

10 

Deferred Financing Costs 

The
Company follows authoritative guidance for accounting for financing
costs as it relates to convertible debt issuance cost. These costs
are deferred and amortized over the term of the debt period or
until redemption of the convertible debentures. Amortization of
deferred financing costs amounted to approximately $0 and $0 for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Amortization of
deferred financing costs amounted to approximately $0 and $200,000
for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

Accounts Payable 

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, one vendor accounted
for approximately 57% and 72% of total accounts payable,
respectively. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, one vendor
accounted for 63% and 76% of cost of goods sold, respectively. For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, one vendor
accounted for 72% and 80% of cost of goods sold,
respectively. 

Accrued Warranties 

Accrued
warranties represent the estimated costs, if any, that will be
incurred during the warranty period of our products. We make an
estimate of expected costs that will be incurred by us during the
warranty period and charge that expense to the consolidated
statement of operations at the date of sale. Our manufacturer
assumes warranty against product defects for one year which we
extend to our customers. We assume responsibility for product
reliability and results. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company did not establish a warranty
reserve. 

Income taxes 

Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The
measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced, if necessary,
by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits, which are, on a more
likely than not basis, not expected to be realized; in accordance
with ASC guidance for income taxes. Net deferred tax benefits have
been fully reserved at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate
changes are enacted. 

Loss Per Share 

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing the Company s net loss
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period presented. Diluted loss per share is based on the
treasury stock method and includes the effect from potential
issuance of common stock such as shares issuable pursuant to the
exercise of warrants and conversions of debentures. 

Potentially
dilutive securities as of September 30, 2016, consisted of
36,826,413 shares of common stock from outstanding warrants,
200,000 shares of common stock from options and 510,000 shares of
common stock from convertible Series A preferred stock. Diluted and
basic weighted average shares are the same, as potentially dilutive
shares are anti-dilutive. 

Potentially
dilutive securities as of September 30, 2015, consisted of
35,601,413 common shares from outstanding warrants, 100,000 common
shares from options and 510,000 common shares from convertible
Series A preferred stock. Diluted and basic weighted average shares
are the same, as potentially dilutive shares are
anti-dilutive. 

Revenue Recognition 

For
revenue from services and product sales, the Company recognizes
revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,
 Revenue Recognition  (SAB No. 104), which superseded
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,  Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements  (SAB No. 101). SAB No. 104 requires
that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be
recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)
service has been rendered or delivery has occurred; (3) the selling
price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is
reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based
on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the
selling prices of the services rendered or products delivered and
the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts to
customers, and allowance, and other adjustments will be provided
for in the same period the related sales are recorded. 

11 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), ASC 718,
Compensation-  Stock Compensation.  Under the
provisions of FASB ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is
estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value
and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had
one active stock-based compensation plan, the TOMI Environmental
Solutions, Inc. Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the
 2008 Plan ). The 2008 Plan calls for the Company,
through a committee of its board of directors, to issue up to
2,500,000 shares of restricted common stock or stock options. The
Company generally issues grants to its employees, consultants, and
board members. Stock options are granted with an exercise price
equal to the closing price of its common stock on the date of the
grant with a term no greater than 10 years. Generally, stock
options vest over two to four years. Incentive stock options
granted to shareholders who own 10% or more of the Company s
outstanding equity securities are granted at an exercise price that
may not be less than 110% of the closing price of the
Company s common stock on the date of grant and have a term
no greater than five years. On the date of a grant, the Company
determines the fair value of the stock option award and recognizes
compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is
generally the vesting period of the award. The fair value of the
stock option award is calculated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. On August 25, 2015, the 2008 Plan was
terminated. 

On
January 29, 2016, the board of directors adopted the 2016 Equity
Compensation Plan (the  2016 Plan ) subject to its
approval by stockholders.  The 2016
Plan authorizes the grant of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance
units / shares. Up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock are
authorized for issuance under the 2016 Plan. Shares issued under
the 2016 Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares,
treasury shares, or any combination thereof. Provisions in the 2016
Plan permit the reuse or reissuance by the 2016 Plan of shares of
common stock for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to,
shares of common stock underlying canceled, expired, or forfeited
awards of stock-based compensation and stock appreciation rights
paid out in the form of cash. Stock-based compensation will
typically be awarded in consideration for the future performance of
services to the Company. All recipients of awards under the 2016
Plan are required to enter into award agreements with the Company
at the time of the award; awards under the 2016 Plan are expressly
conditioned upon such agreements. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, there were 100,000 stock options issued out of
the plan.  

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances at financial
institutions which exceed the current Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ( FDIC ) limit of $250,000 at times during
the year. 

Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets 

The
Company assesses long-lived assets for potential impairments at the
end of each year, or during the year if an event or other
circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the
carrying amount of the asset. In evaluating long-lived assets for
impairment, the Company measures recoverability of these assets by
comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash
flows the assets are expected to generate. If the Company s
long-lived assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
asset exceeds its fair market value. The Company bases its
calculations of the estimated fair value of its long-lived assets
on the income approach. For the income approach, the Company uses
an internally developed discounted cash flow model that include,
among others, the following assumptions: projections of revenues
and expenses and related cash flows based on assumed long-term
growth rates and demand trends; expected future investments to grow
new units; and estimated discount rates. We base these assumptions
on our historical data and experience, industry projections, micro
and macro general economic condition projections, and our
expectations. We have had no long-lived asset impairment charges
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May
2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU
2014-09)  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU
2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) , and requires
entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflect the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those
goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not
permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact
of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17), which simplifies the presentation of
deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and
liabilities be classified as non-current. We retrospectively
adopted this standard as of December 31, 2015. As a result, there
was no impact to the Company s results of
operations.

NOTE 6. CONVERTIBLE DEBT 

In
November 2012, the Company initiated a private placement offering a
maximum of 240 Units (as defined below) of the Company s
securities at a price of $25,000 per Unit or $6,000,000.
 The initial
closing of the offering occurred in April 2013 as the bulk of the
net proceeds of the offering were to be allocated for the asset
purchase from L-3 Applied Technologies, Inc., which was
finalized April 2013.  Each Unit consisted of $25,000 par
amount of a 10% Senior Secured Callable Convertible Promissory Note
due and payable on July 31, 2015 (the  Notes ) and
37,500 warrants each of which allows the investor to purchase one
share of common stock and expires on July 31, 2018. Interest was
payable on the Notes at a rate of 10% per annum, and payable on
July 31 st 
and January 31 st .    The Notes were secured by the
Company s intellectual property such as the patents,
royalties, receivables of the Company and all equipment except for
the new equipment acquired with the proceeds from any future
financing that is initially secured by this new equipment. The
Notes called for the establishment of a sinking fund. Within 45
days of each calendar quarter 15% of the Company s reported
revenue was required to be deposited into the Company s
escrowed sinking fund account. 

The
Company sold 202.96 Units for gross proceeds of $5,074,000 and
issued warrants to purchase up to 7,611,000 shares of common stock
in connection with the Units. Net proceeds amounted to $4,462,693
after expenses of offering totaling $611,307. In addition, the
placement agent received warrants to purchase up to 1,014,800
shares of common stock valued at $165,180. 

The
Notes were convertible, at the option of the note holder, into
shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $.29
(which conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of events specified in the Notes, including stock
dividends, stock splits, certain fundamental corporate
transactions, and certain issuances of common stock by the
Company). 

The
warrants are exercisable into shares of common stock (the
 Warrant Shares ) at an initial exercise price of $0.30
(which may be subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the
warrants).  

The
Company evaluated the warrants under ASC 815-40-15 due to the
exercise price being adjustable upon certain events occurring. The
Company determined that the warrants are considered indexed to the
Company s own common stock and thus meet the scope exception
under FASB ASC 815-10-15-74 and are therefore not considered a
derivative. The estimated fair value of the warrants, which contain
reset provisions, were calculated using the Monte Carlo valuation
model. The Company recorded the warrants  relative fair value
of $956,712 as an increase to additional paid in capital and a
discount against the related debt. 

The
Notes contained a provision whereby the conversion price is
adjustable upon the occurrence of certain events, including the
issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents at a price
which is lower than the current conversion price. Under FASB ASC
815-40-15-5, the embedded conversion feature was not considered
indexed to the Company s own common stock and, therefore, did
not meet the scope exception in FASB ASC 815-10-15 and thus needed
to be accounted for as a derivative liability. The initial fair
value of the embedded conversion feature was estimated at
$7,316,092 and recorded as a derivative liability, resulting in an
additional discount of $4,117,288 to the Notes and a finance charge
of $3,198,804 included in the statement of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2013. The fair value of the embedded conversion
feature was estimated at the end of each quarterly reporting period
using the Monte Carlo model. 

Inherent in the
Monte Carlo Valuation model are assumptions related to expected
volatility, remaining life, risk-free rate and expected dividend
yield. For the Notes using a Monte Carlo model, we estimate the
probability and timing of potential future financing and
fundamental transactions as applicable. The Company applied various
assumptions into the Monte Carlo Valuation models to determine the
change in the fair value of the derivative liability as of the
retirement dates of the Notes. 

The
debt discount was amortized over the life of the convertible note
using the effective interest method and was fully amortized upon
the retirement of the convertible notes during the quarter ended
June 30, 2015. 

In June
2015, the Company offered the noteholders options to convert to
cash or at a reduced conversion price on the Notes from $.29 per
share provided the conversion feature was exercised prior to June
30, 2015.  If the noteholder agreed to
lock up the converted shares for six (6) months or an uplist to a
market on the NYSE or NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC, whichever is
shorter, the conversion price was reduced to $.26 per share. Absent
the lock up, the noteholder could convert at $.275 per share. All
noteholders except two converted at $.26.  Pursuant to the
terms of the conversion offer, an aggregate of $3,774,000 of the
Notes and $124,000 of accrued interest were converted into
14,913,968 shares of the Company s common stock. The Company
recognized an induced conversion cost of $930,383 related to all
conversions and retirements. 

15 

In
addition, during the quarter ended June 30, 2015, an aggregate of
$1,300,000 of the Notes and $87,500 in accrued interest were repaid
in the form of cash.

Notes 

The
assumptions used in the Monte Carlo Models are as

NOTE
7. FAIR VALUE 

Level 3 financial instruments consist of certain embedded
conversion features. The fair value of these embedded conversion
features that have exercise reset features are estimated using a
Monte Carlo valuation model. The Company adopted the disclosure
requirements of ASU 2011-04,   Fair Value Measurements.  
(See note 6) The unobservable input used by the Company was the
estimation of the likelihood of a reset occurring on the embedded
conversion feature of the Convertible Notes. These estimates of the
likelihood of completing an equity raise that would meet the
criteria to trigger the reset provisions are based on numerous
factors, including the remaining term of the financial instruments
and the Company s overall financial condition. 

The
following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the
Company s Level 3 financial instruments for the period ended
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Upon the retirement of
the Notes in June 2015, the fair value of the derivative liability
was $0. 

16 

Changes
in the unobservable input values would likely cause material
changes in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial
instruments. The significant unobservable input used in the fair
value measurement is the estimation of the likelihood of the
occurrence of a change to the conversion price based on the
contractual terms of the financial instruments. A significant
increase (decrease) in this likelihood would result in a higher
(lower) fair value measurement. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the balance of derivative liability was $0 as
the Notes were retired during the second quarter of
2015. 

NOTE 8. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY

Company s board of directors may, without further action by
the Company s stockholders, from time to time, direct the

of such preferred stock may be entitled to receive a preference
payment in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the Company before any payment is made to the holders of our
common stock. Furthermore, the board of directors could issue
preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely
affect the voting power of the holders of our common
stock.

and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed
consolidated financial statements and the related notes included
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated
financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC.
In addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial

statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute
to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in
this Form 10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A,  Risk
Factors.  

Overview 

TOMI is
a leading provider of infection prevention and decontamination
products and services, focused primarily on life sciences including
healthcare, bio-safety, pharmaceutical, clean-room and research.
Our mission is to help our customers create a healthier world thru
TOMI s product line. TOMI s motto is  innovating
for a safer world  for healthcare and life. 

We are
a global decontamination and infectious disease control company,
providing environmental solutions for indoor and outdoor surface
decontamination through the sale of equipment, services and
licensing of our SteraMist TM  Binary Ionization
Technology  ( BIT  ) hydrogen peroxide based
mist and fogs. 

Brought
to the commercial market in June 2013, TOMI s current suite
of products incorporates BIT  Solution and applicators
including the SteraMist  Surface Unit and the
SteraMist  Environment System. Current SteraMist 
BIT  Technology has expanded beyond chemical and biological
warfare applications to deactivate problem microorganisms
(including spores) in a wide variety of commercial settings.
SteraMist  BIT  provides fast acting biological
deactivation and works in even the most hard-to-reach areas while
leaving no residue or noxious fumes. The by-products of the AIHP
are oxygen and water (humidity). 

TOMI
currently targets domestic and international markets for the
control of microorganisms and the decontamination of large and
small indoor space for biological pathogens and chemical agents
including infectious diseases in hospital, bio-secure labs,
pharmaceutical, biodefense, biosafety including isolation and
transfer chambers, tissue banks, food safety and many other
commercial and residential settings. 

In June
2015, SteraMist  BIT  was registered with the EPA as a
hospital-healthcare disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging
agent. The EPA registered solution and equipment combination
provides the unique technology of converting a low percentage
hydrogen peroxide into an activated ionized hydrogen peroxide
consisting mostly of hydroxyl radicals for Hospital-Healthcare
disinfecting and general disinfecting (EPA Registration
90150-2) . 
SteraMist  BIT  also holds a second EPA registration
for mold control and air   surface remediation (EPA
Registration 90150-1). In February 2016, the Company expanded its
label with the EPA to include the bacteria s C. diff and MRSA
and the virus H1N1 which have better positioned the Company to
penetrate the hospital-healthcare and other industries. The Company
currently has its EPA registered label in all 50 states with the
addition of California and New York in July and October of 2016,
respectively. With our label just approved in the state of New York
on October of 2016, TOMI now has a clear path for national sales
and is in the process of interviewing for a National
Healthcare-Hospital sales team. 

In
September of 2016, The Company s SteraMist  BIT 
technology passed Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP )
tests in efficacy against Salmonella and Norovirus. The Company
also passed testing against TB. The GLP studies will be submitted
to the EPA for addition to our existing hospital-healthcare
disinfectant label in the near future. 

In May
2015, the Company was awarded a grant by the United States Agency
for International Development ( USAID ) in the amount
of $559,000 for the development of SteraMist TM  Mobile
Decontamination Chambers to fight the Ebola epidemic. The grant is
based on milestones set forth in the agreement between the Company
and USAID. The Company met the sixth and final milestone in May
2016, which completed the USAID Grant. 

In June
and July 2015, the Company received an $8,000,000 equity investment
from Arise Asset Management Pte Ltd in exchange for approximately
17,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock. Also, in
June 2015, the Company retired approximately $5,100,000 in
convertible debt. With the $8,000,000 investment received and the
retirement of the convertible debt, the Company strengthened its
balance sheet, added liquidity and working capital. 

On the
domestic front in 2016 ,  the Company has received
orders from the Food and Drug Administration to be used in their
laboratory research group, developed and installed our technology
in the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, this is a top-ranked
infectious disease hospitals in the United States-a customized
disinfection system and also completed two follow-up
decontamination service treatments. Other sales included the Kansas
City University of Medicine and Bioscience for use in the
university medical laboratories. 

The
company also won bids to conduct decontamination services at three
major global pharmaceutical companies. 

We have
also begun a trial at a large Ivy League College Hospital on the
East Coast where our Steramist surface unit is being tested in its
operating rooms. 

26 

In 2015, the
Company launched the TOMI Service Network ( TSN ). This
allowed the Company to enhance its service division by creating a
national service network composed of existing full service
restoration industry specialists. Since the launch of the TSN, the
Company has recruited and entered into licensing agreements with 56
geographically and strategically placed companies that will become
network hubs to take advantage of the Company s
SteraMist TM  platform of
products and assist as service providers for the Company s
domestic and international client base and provide regional,
national, and international large event mobilization response. In
the first quarter of 2016, the Company hired a President and
Director of Network Recruitment for the TSN which has contributed
to the growth of the TSN in 2016.   

In
October of 2016, the Company hosted a seminar for the TSN members
in an effort to provide additional technical training on how to use
and sell equipment in the hospital-healthcare environment. The
seminar was sold out with members in attendance from many of our
national TSN companies. 

On an
international front, after registration efforts our technology is
being used and tested in Childcare facilities, Clean-Rooms and
Pharmaceutical facilities in many countries. In addition, during
2015 and 2016, the Company continued to expand its global presence
through the shipments of goods into Asia, Europe, Mexico, South
America and Australia. In January 2016, the Company entered into a
distributor relationship with SteraMist Asia to facilitate growth
in the Asian region. 

In
February 2016, the Company appointed Robert Wotczak as President to
strengthen the executive team and help accelerate the
Company s corporate goals. In addition, the Company added
three new independent members to the Company s board of
directors to support the growth of the Company. 

In
September 2016, the Company upgraded to the OTCQX Best Market in
effort to elevate the profile of the business among the financial
community. 

The
Company s net revenue for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was approximately $4,528,000 compared to $2,433,000 for the
same period in 2015, representing an increase of 86%. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. The estimation process requires assumptions to be made
about future events and conditions, and as such, is inherently
subjective and uncertain. Actual results could differ materially
from our estimates. 

The SEC
defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in
management s view, most important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of
our judgment. We consider the following policies to be critical to
an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the
uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that
could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash
flows. 

Revenue Recognition 

For revenue
from services and product sales, the Company recognizes revenue in
accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue
Recognition  (SAB No. 104), which superseded Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 101,  Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements  (SAB No. 101). SAB No. 104 requires that four
basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) service has been
rendered or delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed
and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on
management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the
selling prices of the services rendered or products delivered and
the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts to
customers, and allowance, and other adjustments will be provided
for in the same period the related sales are recorded.

Fair Value Measurement 

The
authoritative guidance for fair value measurements defines fair
value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or
the most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal
market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to
transact, and (iv)willing to transact. The guidance describes a
fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs, of which the
first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that
may be used to measure fair value, which are the
following: 

Level
1: 

Quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. 

Level
2: 

Inputs
other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable market
data or substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities. 

Level
3: 

Unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that
are significant to the value of the assets or
liabilities. 

The
Company s financial instruments include cash and equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses. All
these items were determined to be Level 1 fair value
measurements. 

The
carrying amounts of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximated fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents
includes cash on hand held at financial institutions and other
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less. 

Accounts Receivable 

Our
accounts receivable are typically from credit worthy customers or,
for certain international customers, are supported by pre-payments.
For those customers to whom we extend credit, we perform periodic
evaluations of them and maintain allowances for potential credit
losses as deemed necessary. We have a policy of reserving for
doubtful accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of
potential credit losses in existing accounts receivable. We
periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an
allowance is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts
and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an
account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed to be
uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of
collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is
considered remote. 

Inventories 

Inventories are
valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out
( FIFO ) method. Inventories consist primarily of
finished goods and raw materials 

Property and Equipment 

We
account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated
depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally
three to five years. Depreciation for equipment, furniture and
fixtures and vehicles commences once placed in service for its
intended use. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the lives of the respective leases or
service lives of the improvements, whichever is
shorter. 

Deferred Financing Costs 

The
Company follows authoritative guidance for accounting for financing
costs as it relates to convertible debt issuance cost. These costs
are deferred and amortized over the term of the debt period or
until redemption of the convertible debentures. 

28 

Accrued Warranties 

Accrued
warranties represent the estimated costs, if any, that will be
incurred during the warranty period of our products. We make an
estimate of expected costs that will be incurred by us during the
warranty period and charge that expense to the consolidated
statement of operations at the date of sale. Our manufacturer
assumes warranty against product defects for one year which we
extend to our customers. We assume responsibility for product
reliability and results. 

Income taxes 

Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The
measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced, if necessary,
by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits, which are, on a more
likely than not basis, not expected to be realized; in accordance
with ASC guidance for income taxes. The effect on deferred income
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. 

Loss Per Share 

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing the Company s net loss
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period presented. Diluted loss per share is based on the
treasury stock method and includes the effect from potential
issuance of common stock such as shares issuable pursuant to the
exercise of warrants and conversions of debentures. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), ASC 718,
Compensation-  Stock Compensation.  Under the
provisions of FASB ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is
estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value
and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had
one active stock-based compensation plan, TOMI Environmental
Solutions, Inc. Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the
 2008 Plan ). The 2008 Plan calls for the Company,
through a committee of its board of directors, to issue up to
2,500,000 shares of restricted common stock or stock options. The
Company generally issues grants to its employees, consultants, and
board members. Stock options are granted with an exercise price
equal to the closing price of its common stock on the date of the
grant with a term no greater than 10 years. Generally, stock
options vest over two to four years. Incentive stock options
granted to shareholders who own 10% or more of the Company s
outstanding equity securities are granted at an exercise price that
may not be less than 110% of the closing price of the
Company s common stock on the date of grant and have a term
no greater than five years. On the date of a grant, the Company
determines the fair value of the stock option award and recognizes
compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is
generally the vesting period of the award. The fair value of the
stock option award is calculated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. On August 25, 2015 the 2008 plan was
terminated. 

On
January 29, 2016, the board of directors adopted the 2016 Equity
Compensation Plan (the  2016 Plan ) subject to its
approval by stockholders.  The 2016
Plan authorizes the grant of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance
units / shares. Up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock are
authorized for issuance under the 2016 Plan. Shares issued under
the 2016 Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares,
treasury shares, or any combination thereof. Provisions in the 2016
Plan permit the reuse or reissuance by the 2016 Plan of shares of
common stock for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to,
shares of common stock underlying canceled, expired, or forfeited
awards of stock-based compensation and stock appreciation rights
paid out in the form of cash. Stock-based compensation will
typically be awarded in consideration for the future performance of
services to the Company. All recipients of awards under the 2016
Plan are required to enter into award agreements with the Company
at the time of the award; awards under the 2016 Plan are expressly
conditioned upon such agreements  

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances at financial
institutions which exceed the current Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ( FDIC ) limit of $250,000 at times during
the year. 

Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets 

We will
review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. We will measure recoverability of these
assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted
cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If intangible
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
asset exceeds its fair market value.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May
2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU
2014-09)  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU
2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
 Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) , and requires
entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those
goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not
permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact
of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17), which simplifies the presentation of
deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and
liabilities be classified as non-current. We have retrospectively
adopted this standard as of December 31, 2015, and as a result
there was no impact to the Company as all of the deferred tax
assets for the year ended December 31, 2014 were classified as
noncurrent. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-02 (ASU 2016-02)  Leases.   ASU 2016-02
provides new lease accounting guidance.  ASU 2016-02 is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that
reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are
currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-09 (ASU 2016-09)  Compensation   Stock
Compensation (Topic 718).   ASU 2016-09 provides
improvements to employee share-based payment accounting.  ASU
2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that
reporting period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the
impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial
statements.

Net Loss 

Net
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
amounted to approximately $935,000 and $546,000, respectively,
representing an increased net loss of $389,000 or 71%. The primary
reasons for the increased net loss can be attributed
to: 

Increased operating
expenses of approximately $432,000, offset by; 

Increase in revenue
of approximately $75,000 and the overall gross profit of
approximately $43,000. 

Sales 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had net
revenue of approximately $1,092,000 and $1,017,000, respectively,
representing an increase in revenue of $75,000 or 7%. The primary
reason for the increase in revenue  was attributable mainly
to the Company expanding into new markets, having sufficient supply
of product to fill orders, as well as diversifying our client
base.  

Cost of Sales 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had cost of
sales of approximately $432,000 and $399,000, respectively,
representing an increase of $33,000, or 8%. The primary reason for
the increase in cost of sales was due to sales increasing during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in
the prior year. 

Professional Fees 

Professional fees
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately
$101,000 as compared to $179,000 during the same period in the
prior year representing a decrease of approximately $78,000, or
43%. Professional fees are mainly comprised of legal and accounting
fees.

approximately $284,000 as compared to $142,000 for the same period
in the prior year representing an increase of $142,000, or 100%.
These expenses represent selling salaries and wages, trade show
fees, commissions and marketing expenses.  We increased our marketing efforts
during the three months ended September 30, 2016. In addition,
these costs increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016
as the result of the hiring of an internal sales staff in an effort
to increase revenue.  

Research   Development 

Research and
development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016
totaled approximately $93,000 as compared to $33,000 in the
corresponding period in 2015, representing an increase of
approximately $60,000 or 183%. The increase compared to the prior
period relates to additional product testing conducted in the third
quarter of 2016. Research and development expenses mainly include
costs incurred in generating and supporting research on improving,
extending and applying our patents in the field of mechanical
cleaning and decontamination. We expect these costs to continue to
increase in 2016. 

Consulting Fees 

Consulting fees for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately
$50,000 as compared to $42,000 during the corresponding period in

months ended September 30, 2016 and totaled approximately $85,000
as compared to $109,000 in 2015. Equity compensation expense is
incurred upon the issuance of warrants. On the date of a grant, we
determine the fair value of the stock option award and recognize
compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is
generally the vesting period of the award. The fair value of the
stock option award is calculated using the Black-Scholes Method
option-pricing model. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General
and administrative expenses include salaries and payroll taxes,
rent, insurance expense, utilities and office expense. General and
administrative expenses were approximately $835,000 and $537,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, representing an increase of $298,000, or 55%. The
primary reason for the increase in General and administrative
expenses can be attributed mainly to higher salaries and wages due
to new hires during the three months ended September 30,
2016.

decrease in consulting fees is primarily due to the Company
entering into a consulting agreement in the second quarter of 2015
which was terminated in January of 2016. 

Equity Compensation Expen se 

Equity
compensation expense represents non-cash charges for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and totaled approximately $542,000
as compared to $1,620,000 in 2015. Equity compensation expense is
incurred upon the issuance of warrants. On the date of a grant, we
determine the fair value of the stock option award and recognize

primary reason for the increase in General and administrative
expenses can be attributed mainly to higher salaries and wages due
to new hires during the nine months ended September 30,
2016. 

Other Income and Expense 

Amortization of
deferred financing costs was approximately $0 and $200,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This
represents the amortization of costs incurred to raise capital in
relation to the acquisition of the SteraMist TM  line of products
from L-3 and were fully amortized in the second quarter of 2015
upon retiring the convertible notes. 

Amortization of
debt discount was approximately $0 and $3,996,000 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing the amortization of debt discount on the $5,074,000 in
convertible notes issued in 2013. The debt discount was amortized
over the life of the notes utilizing the effective interest
method. 

The
fair value adjustment of the derivative liability during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, amounted to approximately a
$3,811,000 loss in the prior period. Upon the retirement of the
convertible notes in the second quarter of 2015, the derivative
liability was reclassified to additional paid in
capital. 

Interest expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
approximately $0 and $254,000, respectively. This represented the
interest due on the $5,074,000 in convertible notes issued in 2013
in connection with the acquisition of the SteraMist TM  line of products
from L-3 that were retired in the second quarter of
2015. 

Income
recognized from grant for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was $202,000. This represents the amounts advanced to the Company
in excess of the costs incurred. 

Gain on
disposition of equipment for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 amounted to $12,000. 

Net Loss 

The net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to
approximately $2,549, 000 versus a loss of approximately
$12,020,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The loss
per common share, basic and diluted, for the nine months ended

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,288,000 and
working capital of $6,210,000.   

Our
principal capital requirements are to fund operations, invest in
research and development and capital equipment, and the continued
costs of public company filing requirements. We have historically
funded our operations through debt and equity financings.  In
June and July 2015, we completed private placements and received
net proceeds of approximately $8,000,000. In June 2015, we redeemed
and converted all of the Notes by issuing approximately 14,900,000
shares of common stock, and $1,300,000 in cash. 

In September of 2016 the Company s shares were up listed to
the OTCQX Best Market. The Company intends to further uplist to a
national stock exchange.  We understand there are qualitative
and quantitative benchmarks that will need to be met in order to
get listed on a national stock exchange.  This could require
us to raise additional capital in order to meet the quantitative
benchmarks. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
satisfy these qualitative and quantitative benchmarks or raise
additional capital on terms favorable to the Company, if at
all. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred losses
from operations of approximately $2,763,000 and $2,829,000,
respectively.  The cash used in operations amounted to
approximately $4,180,000 and $1,803,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Company could
incur additional operating losses from lack of revenues and an
increase of costs related to the continuation of product and
technology development and administrative activities. 

Management of the
Company has taken and will endeavor to continue to take a number of
actions in order to improve the Company s results of
operations and the related cash flows generated from operations in
order to get the Company to a stronger financial position. 
These actions include the following items: 

Expanding our label
with the EPA to include the bacteria s C. diff and MRSA and
the virus H1N1 in the EPA stamped registration.  In February
2016, the Company achieved the amended registration and feels it
could allow TOMI to change the way our product is marketed in the
United States Hospital-Healthcare verticals that could lead to
further market penetration for the Company. 

Continued expansion
and efforts to expand our internal salesforce and manufacturer
representatives in an effort to drive domestic revenue in all
Hospital-Healthcare verticals. 

Expansion of
international distributors.  In January 2016, the Company
announced the distributor relationship with Steramist Asia to
facilitate growth in the Asian region, specifically Mainland China
and Indo-China excluding South Korea, Japan and Australia/New
Zealand . 

Continued growth of
the TSN.  In January 2016, the Company hired a President and
Director of Network Recruitment for TSN in order to increase
TSN s internal salesforce which therefore increased
membership.  TSN currently has a total of 56 members and 32
members have been added year to date. 

We
believe that our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and
amounts expected to be provided by operations will provide us with
sufficient financial resources to meet our cash requirements for
operations, working capital and capital expenditures over the next
twelve months.   However, in the
event of unforeseen circumstances, unfavorable market developments
or unfavorable results from operations, there can be no assurance
that the above actions could be successfully implemented as
expected, and cash flows may be adversely affected.  Our sales
cycle has come down but could exceed approximately 4-6 months and
it s possible we may not be able to generate sufficient
revenue in the next twelve months to cover our operating and
compliance costs. We may also need to raise additional debt or
equity financing to execute on the commercialization of our product
plans. We cannot make any assurances that management s
strategies will be effective or that any additional financing will
be completed on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. Our
inability to successfully implement our strategies or to complete
any other financing may mean that we would have to significantly
reduce costs and/or delay projects, which would adversely affect
our business, customers and program development, and would
adversely impact the Company.  

The
Company s analysis of cash flows for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, is as follows: 

Operating activities 

Cash used in operating activities 
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
approximately $4,180,000 and $1,803,000, respectively. Cash used in
operating activities increased $2,377,000 as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to increased
inventory offset by increased accounts payable compared to the same
period ended in the prior year. 

35 

Investing Activities 

Cash used in investing activities 
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amounted
to approximately $449,000 and $54,000. Cash used in investing
activities increased $395,000 compared to the period in the prior
year, primarily due to service equipment purchased in
2016. 

Financing Activities 

Cash provided by financing activities 
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to
$0. 

Cash provided by financing activities 
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 amounted to
approximately $7,490,000 primarily from the proceeds of the
issuance of common stock and warrants of $8,735,000 offset by the
repayment of principal for a portion of the convertible notes of
$1,300,000. In addition, the Company incurred a finder s fee
of approximately $51,000 in connection with the issuance of the
stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Contractual Obligations 

Our
contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 are summarized as
follows (in thousands): 

(1)
Amounts represent a non-cancelable operating lease for office space
in Frederick, MD that terminates on January 31, 2018. In addition
to base rent, the lease calls for payment of common area
maintenance operating expenses. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained
in Item 1. Financial Statements above. 

Disclosure About Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do
not have any transactions, agreements or other contractual
arrangements that constitute off-balance sheet
arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

See
Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained
in Item 1. Financial Statements above. 

36 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk. 

The
Company is a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by SEC Rules 405
and 12b-2 and is not required to disclose the information required
by Regulation S-K, Item 305 pursuant to the Smaller Reporting
Company exemption in Regulation S-K, Item 305(e). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Form
10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that
as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and
procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are
effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are
required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d)
or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this
Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints
and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the
benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their
costs.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings . 

We are
not a party to any material proceedings or threatened proceedings
as of the date of this filing. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

In
addition to the information set forth in this quarterly report on

with the SEC, including without limitation the risk factors
contained under the caption  Item 1A Risk
Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 that could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The
risk factors discussed in that Form 10-K do not identify all
risks that we face because our business operations could also be
affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us
or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.
There have been no material changes in the significant factors that
may affect our business and operations as described in  Item
