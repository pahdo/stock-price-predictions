Item             11     
     Executive Compensation           EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION   
 The following table sets forth information concerning the compensation earned by our principal executive officer and principal financial officer during 2015
and 2014:      

(1) 
 The amount shown in the table represents the grant date fair value of the restricted stock granted in 2015, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Information regarding assumptions made in valuing the stock
awards can be found in Note 13, Stockholders  Equity, to the consolidated financial statements included herein.    

(2) 
 The amount shown in the table represents the grant date fair value of the stock options granted in 2015 and 2014, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The fair value of the stock options awarded was
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Information regarding assumptions made in valuing the option grants under this model can be found in Note 13, Stockholders  Equity, to the consolidated financial statements included
herein.    

(3) 
 All other compensation relates to the matching 401k contribution by the Company.    

(4) 
 All other compensation includes a housing reimbursement.    

(5) 
 All other compensation relates to reimbursed business expenses.      No other executive officers received cash
compensation greater than $100,000 in any of the past two fiscal years.    We currently have a long-term incentive and bonus program for the benefit of
employees and officers of the Company. The program is primarily focused on senior officers, but certain elements of the plan are made available to key managers and to any employee in certain circumstances. In addition, management has established a
401(K) plan for employees and officers of the Company.     Change in Control Termination Agreement   
 Mr. Corp has a change in control termination agreement. A change of control is defined in the change in control termination agreement to mean when more
than 50% of the Company s common shares are sold to a new owner or a group forming a block for the purpose of such investment in ownership.    The
Change in Control Termination Agreement provides a severance payment equal to twice the annual salary plus 85,000 shares of common stock in the event one of the following occurs subsequent to a change in control of the Company, (1) the new
ownership of the Company terminates Mr. Corp s employment or demotes him in level of responsibility or moves his place of employment (office) more than 30 miles from St. Marys WV during the 12 month period beginning immediately upon the
change in control, such termination or demotion not being the result of  good cause , or (2) Mr. Corp voluntarily ends his employment during the 30-day period immediately following the 12-month period described in (1).  
 Mr. Lucado also has a change in control termination agreement with terms substantially similar to those in Mr. Corp s agreement.
