     Table of Contents           CHEETAH ENTERPRISES, INC.     Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     August 31, 2016    ( Unaudited )       NOTE 1 -   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS      Cheetah Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") is a Nevada corporation incorporated on June 27, 2014. It is based in San Jose, Costa Rica. The Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, "Cheetah Autos S.A." in Costa Rica on September 26, 2014. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Company's fiscal year end is November 30.     The Company intends to import, buy locally, and sell used automobiles in the Costa Rican market. To date, the Company's activities have been limited to its formation and the raising of equity capital.      NOTE 2 -   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Unaudited Interim Financial Statements       The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. This report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 29, 2016.     In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year.       Basis of Consolidation       These financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the wholly-owned subsidiary, Cheetah Autos S.A. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.       Basis of Presentation       The Financial Statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Financial Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") of the United States.       Use of Estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.                  7       
     Table of Contents           Cash and Cash Equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. The Company had $15,606 and $32,885 in cash and cash equivalents as of August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, respectively.       Inventory       Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market price. Inventories on hand are evaluated on an on-going basis to determine if any items are obsolete or in excess of future needs. Items determined to be obsolete are reserved for. As at August 31, 2016 and November 31, 2015, the Company determined that no reserve related to inventory was required.       Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock       The Company has adopted ASC Topic 260,  "Earnings per Share,"  ("EPS") which requires presentation of basic EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.     The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings per share, for the three and nine month periods ending August 31, 2016 and 2015:           The Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding.       Concentrations of Credit Risk       The Company's financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents that it will likely incur in the near future. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company's management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.                  8       
     Table of Contents           Financial Instruments       The Company follows ASC 820, " Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, " which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:      Level 1      Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.      Level 2      Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.      Level 3      Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.     The Company's financial instruments consist principally of cash, inventory, and accounts payable. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of the Company's cash is determined based on "Level 1" inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all of the Company's other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.       Foreign Currency Translations       The Company's functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our subsidiary's functional currency is the Costa Rican Colon. All transactions initiated in Costa Rican Colones are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830-30,  "Translation of Financial Statements,"  as follows:               (i)     Monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.                   (ii)     Equity at historical rates.                   (iii)     Revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period.         Adjustments arising from such translations are deferred until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity as a component of comprehensive income or loss. Therefore, translation adjustments are not included in determining net income (loss) but reported as other comprehensive income.     For foreign currency transactions, the Company translates these amounts to the Company's functional currency at the exchange rate effective on the invoice date. If the exchange rate changes between the time of purchase and the time actual payment is made, a foreign exchange transaction gain or loss results which is included in determining net income for the period. No significant realized exchange gains or losses were recorded during the period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.                  9       
     Table of Contents           Related Parties       The Company follows ASC 850,  "Related Party Disclosures,"  for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. See note 5.       Revenue Recognition       The Company will recognize revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 605, "Revenue Recognition."  The Company will recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met:               i)    Persuasive evidence for an agreement exists;                   ii)    Service has been provided;                   iii)    The fee is fixed or determinable; and,                   iv)    Collection is reasonably assured.           Recent Accounting Pronouncements       Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company's management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.      NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has a loss from operations of $29,586, an accumulated deficit of $61,096 and has earned minimal revenues since inception. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending November 30, 2016.     The ability of the Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings and through loans from officers and directors.     These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.      NOTE 4 - EQUITY        Preferred Stock       The Company has authorized 10,000,000 preferred shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. The Board of Directors are authorized to divide the authorized shares of Preferred Stock into one or more series, each of which shall be so designated as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series and classes.              Common Stock       The Company has authorized 125,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. Each common share entitles the holder to one vote, in person or proxy, on any matter on which action of the stockholders of the corporation is sought.     Since inception (June 27, 2014) to August 31, 2016, the Company has issued a total of 20,466,050 common shares for cash of $70,811, as follows:            NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS       Equity      On July 7, 2014 the Company issued to an officer and director, 12,500,000 shares of its common stock to at $0.001 per share for proceeds of $12,500.     On October 23, 2014, the Company issued to an officer and director, 4,270,000 shares of common stock at $0.005 per share for proceeds of $21,350.      Other      The controlling shareholder has pledged his support to fund continuing operations during the development stage; however, there is no written commitment to this effect. The Company is dependent upon the continued support.     The officer and director of the Company may be involved in other business activities, and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities that become available. He may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.     The Company does not have employment contracts with its two key employees, the controlling shareholder, and the officers and director of the Company. During the period ended August 31, 2016 the Company paid $1,200 to officers for commissions on the sale of vehicles. During the period ended August 31, 2015 the Company paid $1,693 to officers for commissions on the sale of vehicles.      NOTE 6 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued. Based on our evaluation no events have occurred that require disclosure.             Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.          Forward-Looking Statements         Except for historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, statements regarding our business strategy, future revenues and anticipated costs and expenses. Such forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "believes" and similar language. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed herein as well as in the "Description of Business   Risk Factors" section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed on February 29, 2016. You should carefully review the risks described in our Prospectus and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.         Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.         All references in this Form 10-Q to the "Company,"  Cheetah,  "we," "us," or "our" are to Cheetah Enterprises, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary Cheetah Autos S.A.      Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.        Description of Business      Cheetah Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 27, 2014, and our fiscal year end is November 30. Our company's administrative address is Condominio Torres Paseo Colon, #604 San Jose, Costa Rica. Our telephone number is 506-8730-1923.     We are a start-up company and have generated minimal revenues and have limited cash on hand. We have sustained losses since inception and have relied solely upon the sale of our securities for funding. We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.      Business of the Company      Our objective is to provide quality used vehicles at a reasonable price to customers in Costa Rica, through our wholly-owned Costa Rican subsidiary, Cheetah Autos S.A. We will accomplish this by purchasing quality used vehicles and advertising them through newspapers, word of mouth, auto trade magazines, and the planned corporate website. We intend to sell cars that are either being resold in the Costa Rican market or imported from the U.S., preferably imported in from Florida and Texas. Our focus will be first sourcing local cars of good quality and value that can be sold quickly for a profit.     The majority of our advertising will be done locally through word of mouth, local newspapers and websites, and, eventually, we intend to also advertise on our planned website. The vehicles advertised in trade magazines will link potential customers to our website. Currently, we are developing the website, www.cheetahenterprises.com, and when we find the funds available, we will develop a website locally for the Costa Rican market, www.cheeathautos.com, to advertise our company and our vehicles.           During January 2015, we commenced on our operations, through the purchase and sale of our first vehicle. We expect that we will have a gradual sales increase, as we have not yet started the development of our website, and we have not yet started any advertising and marketing. Therefore, our only source of advertising currently is word of mouth.      Principal Products, Services and Their Markets      Our focus is to competitively supply quality used vehicles to the Costa Rican market. Automobiles which are in good condition, i.e., low mileage for age, service history, pedigree of vehicle and accident free, will be sourced. Owner histories - preferably one owner vs. multiple owners will be of primary importance. The objective is to find buyers for cars, as opposed to focusing on finding cars for customers.     We will provide fully inspected vehicles and documentation of full history, quality and disclosure of known problems. We will have done full maintenance, along with complete detailing, inside and out, before selling vehicles. We anticipate that we will be able to locate many of our used cars locally in the Costa Rican market, largely from expatriates that are in need of selling their cars when returning to their native countries. For cars that we source from the U.S., we will use customs brokers who provide the necessary customs/brokerage paperwork, as well as ensuring the automobile complies with Costa Rican regulations. Most automobiles that are sold in the U.S. market comply with Costa Rican safety and emission standards at the date of manufacture. However, every automobile will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If the cost of modifying a vehicle is too great, the vehicle will not be imported into the Costa Rican market.      Critical Accounting Policies      We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared and actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation our financial statements. Please refer to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for disclosures regarding our company's critical accounting policies and estimates, as well as any updates further disclosed in our interim financial statements as described in this Form 10-Q.       Use of Estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Going Concern      We have a history of operating losses, as we have focused our efforts on raising capital and building our services. The report of our independent auditors issued on our financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30, 2015, expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our obtaining additional adequate capital to fund additional operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations.            Results of Operations      We were incorporated in June 2014, and our operations commenced January 2015. Our financial results for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:           During the three months ended August 31, 2016, we realized gross profits of $755 from the purchase and sale of automobiles compared to $916 for the three months ended August 31, 2015. Gross profit is based on the gross selling price we receive from a vehicle sale less all direct costs, which consist of: the cost to purchase the vehicle, repairs and cleaning to the vehicle to get it to sales condition, and any licensing and taxes directly related to the purchase and sale, and other miscellaneous direct costs.     Our general and administrative expenses consist of bank service change, regulatory fees and fees paid to management and general office and overhead. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, we paid management fees of $1,200 to our two officers and directors.     Our professional fees consist of legal, accounting and other fees, primarily due to our reporting requirements with the SEC. For the three months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred legal fees of $2,205, accounting fees of $2,000, and other professional of $5,413.     Our financial results for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:                  During the nine months ended August 31, 2016, we realized gross profits of $755 from the purchase and sale of automobiles compared to $3,489 for the nine months ended August 31, 2015. Gross profit is based on the gross selling price we receive from a vehicle sale less all direct costs, which consist of: the cost to purchase the vehicle, repairs and cleaning to the vehicle to get it to sales condition, and any licensing and taxes directly related to the purchase and sale, and other miscellaneous direct costs.     Our general and administrative expenses consist of bank service change, regulatory fees and fees paid to management and general office and overhead. During the nine months ended August 31, 2016, we paid management fees of $1,200 to our two officers and directors.     Our professional fees consist of legal, accounting and other fees, primarily due to our reporting requirements with the SEC. For the nine months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred legal fees of $3,705, accounting fees of $4,000, and other professional of $18,631.     The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the periods ended August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015.            Liquidity and Capital Resources      From June 27, 2014 (inception) through August 31, 2016, we have relied almost exclusively on funds raised from sales of shares of our common stock under our registration statement and to one of our founders. The offering of the securities registered by that registration statement commenced on June 25, 2015 and closed on March 31, 2016. 3,696,050 shares of our common stock registered by that registration statement were sold for gross proceeds of $39,961.     Our operations commenced in January 2015, from the purchase and sale of our first vehicle. However, at present, we only have enough cash on hand to pay minimal SEC reporting expenses for the purchase and sale of a limited number of vehicles at any one time. We only have enough cash on hand to cover minimal operations over the next 12 months. We will require at least $20,000 to remain reporting with the SEC for the next 12 months.     We may need to raise additional capital to carry out our business plan. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or if we are able to raise additional capital that the terms will be acceptable to us.     We had cash on hand of $15,606 and $32,885 at August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, respectively. Our primary needs for cash are to expand our business. For the next 12 months, we require a minimum of $20,000 for professional fees related to being a reporting company.           Our sources and uses of funds were as follows:                  Cash Flows from Operating Activities      We used net cash of $31,752 in our operating activities during the period ended August 31, 2016, consisting of a loss of $29,586 increased by due to an increase in prepaid and other assets of $2,775 and inventory of $4,817, and reduced by due to an increase of accounts payable of $5,426. We used net cash of $14,953 in our operating activities during the period ended August 31, 2015, consisting of a loss of $23,179, reduced by $12,009 due to an increase in accounts payable and increased by due to an increase in inventory of $3,783.      Cash Flows from Financing Activities      Cash provided by financing activities during the period ended August 31, 2016, consisted of $14,473 from the issuance of common shares, from our recent offering. We did not have any cash flows from financing activities during the period ended August 31, 2015      Working Capital      As of August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, we had a net working capital of $9,715 and $24,828, respectively. Our working capital decreased by $15,113 as at August 31, 2016, as compared to November 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in cash of $17,279 and an increase in inventory of $4,817, prepaid and other current assets of $2,775 and accounts payable of $5,426.     Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Since inception, we have generated minimal revenue and accumulated operating losses. All of these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.             Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide the information required by this item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.             Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms as a result of the following material weaknesses:     The specific material weakness identified by our management was ineffective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because of a lack of a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements and inadequate segregation of duties. A "material weakness" is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.     We expect to be materially dependent upon a third party to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements.       Changes in Internal Controls           There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the quarter ended August 31, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.             PART II   OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings.       We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.       Item 1A. Risk Factors.       As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.         None.       Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.       None.       Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure.       Not applicable.
