1.  
     
       BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial
      statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form
      10-Q and therefore do not include all information and footnotes necessary
      for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and
      cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
      the United States of America (GAAP); however, such information reflects
      all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments), which
      are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of
      the results for the interim periods.   

The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
      should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes
      thereto together with management s discussion and analysis of financial
      condition and results of operations contained in Security Devices
      International Inc. s ( SDI  or the  Company ) annual report on Form 10-K
      for the year ended November 30, 2015. In the opinion of management, the
      accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect
      all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to
      fairly state the financial position of the Company at August 31, 2016 and
      November 30, 2015, the results of its operations for the nine and
      three-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, and its
      cash flows for the nine-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31,
      2015. In addition, some of the Company s statements in this quarterly
      report on Form 10-Q may be considered forward-looking and involve risks
      and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results. The
      results of operations for the nine-month period ended August 31, 2016 are
      not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full
    year.   

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state
      of Delaware on March 1, 2005. On February 3, 2014 the Company incorporated
      a wholly owned subsidiary in Canada  Security Devices International Canada
      Corp . The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the
      period ended August 31, 2016 include the accounts of Security Devices
      International, Inc. (the  Company  or  SDI ), and its subsidiaries
      Security Devices International Canada Corp. and SDI-Sage Acquisition Inc.
      All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been
      eliminated.     

2.  
     
       NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN   

The Company is a less-lethal defense technology company,
      specializing in the innovative next generation solutions for security
      situations that do not require the use of lethal force. SDI has
      implemented manufacturing partnerships to assist in the deployment of
      their patented and patent pending family of products. These products
      consist of the current manufacture of Blunt Impact Projectile 40mm (BIP)
      line of products, and the future Wireless Electric Projectile 40mm
      (WEP).   

These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
      have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company
      will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its
      next fiscal year.   

The Company s activities are subject to risk and
      uncertainties including-   

The Company has not earned adequate revenue and has used
      cash in its operations. Therefore, the Company will need additional
      financing to continue its operations if it is unable to generate
      substantial revenue growth.   

The Company has incurred a cumulative loss of $27,937,161
      from inception to August 31, 2016. The Company has funded operations
      through the issuance of capital stock and convertible debentures. The
      Company has started to generate revenue from operations. However, it still
      expects to incur significant expenses before becoming profitable. The
      Company s future success is dependent upon its ability to raise sufficient
      capital or generate adequate revenue, to cover its ongoing operating
      expenses, and also to continue to develop and be able to profitably market
      its products. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to
      continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
      adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
  uncertainty.

       STOCK BASED COMPENSATION   

Effective May 31, 2013, the Company adopted an incentive
      stock option plan (the  2013 Plan ), which replaces the stock option and
      stock bonus plans that were in place prior to adoption of the 2013 Plan.
      All outstanding options to purchase Common Shares granted by the Company
      under the prior plans are now governed by the 2013 Plan and the prior
      plans (an Incentive Stock Option Plan, a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan,
      and a Stock Bonus Plan) have been terminated.   

The purpose of this Plan is to authorize the grant to
      Eligible Persons of the Company of Options to purchase Shares and thus
      benefit the Company by enabling it to attract, retain and motivate
      Eligible Persons by providing them with the opportunity, through Options,
      to acquire an increased proprietary interest in the Company.   

The maximum number of Shares which may be reserved for
      issuance to any one Consultant under the Plan, any other employer stock
      options plans or options for services, within any 12-month period, shall
      be 2% of the Shares issued and outstanding at the time of the grant (on a
      non-diluted basis).   

The maximum number of Shares which may be reserved for
      issuance to Investor Relations Optionees under the Plan, any other
      employer stock options plans or options for services, within any 12-month
      period shall be 2% of the Shares issued and outstanding at the time of the
      grant (on a non-diluted basis).   

The maximum number of Shares which may be reserved for
      issuance to insiders of the Company in any 12-month period shall be 10% of
      the Shares issued and outstanding at the start of such 12-month period (on
      a non-diluted basis).   

The purchase price (the  Price ) for the Shares under
      each Option shall be determined by the Board of Directors or Committee, as
      applicable, on the basis of the market price, where  market price  shall
      mean the prior trading day closing price of the Shares on any stock
      exchange on which the Shares are listed or last trading price on the prior
      trading day on any dealing network where the Shares trade, and where there
      is no such closing price or trade on the prior trading day,  market price 
      shall mean the average of the daily high and low board lot trading prices
      of the Shares on any stock exchange on which the Shares are listed or
      dealing network on which the Shares trade for the five (5) immediately
      preceding trading days. In the event the Shares are listed on the TSXV,
      the price may be the market price less any discounts from the market price
      allowed by the TSXV, subject to a minimum price of CDN$0.10.   

Year ended November 30, 2015    

On September 24, 2015, the board of directors extended
      the expiry dates of 572,000 warrants issued in 2010 to directors and
      officers at exercise price of $0.20, from original expiry date of
      September 30, 2015 to September 23, 2019. In addition, on same date, the
      board of directors extended the expiry dates of 1,470,000 warrants issued
      to directors and officers and 35,000 to a consultant, all issued in 2012
      at exercise price of $0.13, from original expiry date of January 4, 2016
      to September 23, 2019. The change in the terms of the warrants was
      determined to be a modification and not a cancellation and issuance of a
      new warrant. As a result of these modifications, the fair value of
      2,077,000 warrants increased by $216,684. Fair value of warrants was
      calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following
      assumptions:     
 
 On October 20, 2015, the board of
directors granted 1,350,000 options to directors and officers and 325,000
options to consultants to acquire a total of 1,675,000 common shares. These
options were issued at an exercise price of $0.29 (CAD $0.38) per share and vest
immediately with an expiry term of five years. The fair value of each option
used for the purpose of estimating the stock compensation is calculated using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:  
 
 As of November 30, 2015 there was $Nil
of unrecognized expense related to non-vested stock-based compensation
arrangements granted. 
  Nine- month period ended August 31,
2016  
 On August 18, 2016, the board of
directors granted options to a consultant to acquire a total of 25,000 common
shares. These options were issued at an exercise price of $0.11 (CAD $0.14) per
share and vest immediately with an expiry term of five years. The fair value of
each option used for the purpose of estimating the stock compensation is
calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions:  
 
 As of August 31, 2016 there was $Nil of
unrecognized expense related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements
granted.

     CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES AND
      DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS   

$1,398,592 (CAD $1,549,000)
      Convertible Debentures     

On August 6, 2014, the Company issued $1,398,592 (CAD
      $1,549,000) face value 12% convertible debentures with a term to August 6,
      2017 (the  Maturity Date ). At any time while the debentures are
      outstanding, the holder has the option to convert the outstanding
      principal of the debentures into common shares of the Company at a fixed
      conversion price of CAD $0.50 per share. At any time after February 6,
      2015, the Company has the right to force the conversion of the debentures
      into common shares at a price of at least CAD$0.65 per common share for a
      period of at least 20 consecutive trading days. If the common shares do
      not trade on any trading day and the bid price of the common Shares is CAD
      $0.65 or greater, the common shares shall be deemed to have traded at a
      price of at least CAD $0.65 on that trading day. Additionally, the Company
      has the right to redeem the debentures, in whole or in part, (a) during
      the 12 months ending August 6, 2015, at a premium of 15% to the principal
      amount being redeemed plus any accrued interest, (b) during the 12 months
      ending August 6, 2016, at a premium of 5% to the principal amount being
      redeemed plus any accrued interest, (c) during the 12 months ending August
      6, 2017, at a premium of 2% to the principal amount being redeemed plus
      any accrued interest. In connection with the financing, the Company issued
      warrants to placement agents to purchase 151,900 shares of common stock at
      an exercise price of CAD $0.50 per share. Additionally, the Company
      incurred $157,293 (CAD $174,209) in financing fees.    

The Company has evaluated the terms and conditions of the
      convertible debentures and placement agent warrants under the guidance of
      ASC 815. The conversion feature met the definition of conventional
      convertible for purposes of applying the conventional convertible
      exemption. The definition of conventional contemplates a fixed number of
      shares issuable under the arrangement. The instrument was convertible into
      a fixed number of shares and there were no down round anti-dilution
      protection features contained in the contracts. The Company was required
      to consider whether the hybrid contract embodied a beneficial conversion
      feature ( BCF ). The debentures did not result in a BCF because the
      conversion price was not in the money on the inception date. There were no
      terms or features contained in the warrant agreement that would preclude
      the warrants from achieving equity classification.    

The following table reflects the
      allocation of the purchase on the financing date:     
 
 The warrants were valued at $33,583 and
were recorded as a component of deferred financing costs. Interest expense
related to the debentures amounted to $174,341 for the nine- month period ended
August 31, 2016. Of the $174,341, $126,449 related to interest and the remaining
$47,892 related to the amortization of deferred financing costs. Unamortized
deferred financing costs as of August 31, 2016 consists of current costs of
$59,216 (November 31, 2015: $63,741) and non- current costs of $nil (November
30, 2015: $43,367).

   Industry Overview   
 It is the Company s belief that the United States, along with
most parts of the world are in the very early stages of a significant spike in
the growth curve for  less-lethal  products. Most law enforcement agencies do
not have a proper working knowledge of a less-lethal program in place. Rather
they are using an assortment of less-lethal devices out of necessity for varying
degrees of effectiveness with little coordination or approved tactical plans for
their deployment. Law enforcement budget constraints usually play a role in this
behavior. It is for this reason that unintended deaths of unarmed suspects at
the hands of police departments throughout the country (and in fact throughout
the world) continue to happen. 
 With a rise in social and civil unrest both here and abroad and
with more and more of these incidents being caught on video and posted on social
media, the pressure on law enforcement and governments to find reasonable and
effective alternatives to lethal force is mounting daily. As a result, it is
management s opinion that the less-lethal market will be one of the faster
growing segment in the law enforcement, correctional services, crowd control and
security services markets over the next decade. 
 Less-lethal weapons include a wide variety of products designed
to disorient, slow down and stop would be assailants, rioters and other
malfeasants. In the Company s opinion, the less-lethal weapon that is growing
the fastest in popularity and adoption is the 40mm launcher along with the
various less-lethal munitions that can be fired from these launchers. These
munitions include both impact rounds designed to stop an individual without
causing permanent injury to payload rounds carrying a variety of powders and
liquids including tear gas, pepper spray, DNA marking liquids, mal-odorants and
other marking liquids and powders designed to identify instigators in a riot
situation. 
 Historically, these munitions were fired from 37mm launchers,
however, the industry has been moving to 40mm launchers due to the fact that the
40mm launcher barrel is rifled (while the 37mm is a smooth bore barrel less
accurate munition) which allows the operator to more accurately fire the rounds
at distances in excess of 100 . This makes the 40mm launcher an effective tool
in a wide range of situations.  
 15  

Business    
  History   
 Security Devices International Inc. (the  Company  or the
 Corporation ) was incorporated on March 1, 2005. The Company began as a
research and development company focused on the development of 40mm less-lethal
ammunition. 
 The Company initiated with the development of a wireless
electric projectile (the  WEP ), named the Lektrox. The Company hired a
ballistics engineering firm to collaborate in the development of the WEP. 
 Commencing in December 2008, the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons
Directorate ( JNLWD ) of the US Department of Defense, an organization
responsible for the development and coordination of non-lethal weapons
activities within the United States, tested the WEP through its evaluation
facility at Penn State University. An executive summary was released to the
Company indicating a positive outcome.  
 In the fall of 2010 the Company underwent a change in the board
of directors and management. This precipitated a change in the direction of the
company as development of the WEP was discontinued and the company shifted its
focus to a new product   the Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP). The Company
concluded that the cost and time required to complete development and testing of
the BIP were significantly less than that required to complete development and
testing of the WEP. The goal was to develop a product that it could bring to
market more quickly. The Company was able to exploit some of the patent pending
technology of the WEP into the BIP. In 2011, the Company moved its engineering,
intellectual property and production facilities to the operator (the  BIP
Manufacturer ) of an injection molding facility outside of Boston,
Massachusetts. 
  The Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP)   A Transformative
Technology   
 When the less-lethal industry was dominated by the 37mm
launcher, a number of less-lethal companies developed  impact munition rounds 
designed to  stop  an assailant. These round were nothing more than a piece of
plastic, wood baton, rubber baton, or a piece of plastic with a piece of sponge
rubber or foam rubber affixed to the head of the round.  
 There were several problems with these rounds. First, they were
inaccurate due to the lack of barrel rifling. Since most SWAT teams carry single
shot launchers, a round that cannot be shot accurately is of little value.
Second, because of their lightweight, they did not have much stopping power.
Suspects that were  committed  would often  shake off  a direct hit. Finally,
the rounds would bounce off walls or other hard surfaces which made them
dangerous to use in confined areas such as a jail cell. Numerous corrections
officers have been hurt by impact rounds ricocheting off of jail cell walls.
 
 Security Devices International solved all three issues with the
development of its  Blunt Impact Projectile  (BIP). The BIP was developed as an
outgrowth of a research and development project to create a conductive electric
device bullet (project name WEP   Wireless Electric Projectile). 
 In order to ensure that the projectile did not injure the
targeted individual, SDI needed to develop a way to cushion the impact of the
round upon contact with the target. The solution was a collapsible head that
compressed upon impact. (See below). When it became clear that SDI did not have
sufficient funds to complete development of the WEP, it was decided to use the
collapsible head design to create an impact round. The hope was that with this
new, state-of-the-art impact round, SDI could generate enough profitability that
it would be able to complete development of the WEP.  
 16  

This collapsible head technology allowed SDI to build a heavier
projectile that did not require a rubber or foam tip. This meant that it could
take advantage of the rifling of the 40mm launcher. This made the BIP by far the
most accurate round on the market in comparison to previous 37mm projectiles.
The target for an impact round is to be a large muscle group such as the thigh
muscle. 
 The gel collapsible head of the BIP spreads out upon impact,
dispersing the energy over a larger area thus reducing blunt trauma to the
subject. This allows the BIP round to be fired at close range on a target. 
 The Company believes that its patented collapsible head
technology will transform the industry as law enforcement agencies recognize the
tactical advantages of a less-lethal weapon that can be safely, accurately and
effectively deployed at close range distances between 3 feet and 100 feet. There
is simply nothing else on the market today that can compete with the BIP. SDI
has been in discussions several industry players about licensing SDI s
technology. 
 Early in 2011 the Company focused its attention on a new 40mm
product, the blunt impact projectile ( BIP ), and discontinued further
development work on the WEP. 
   2012    
 In June 2012, the Company contracted CRT Less Lethal Inc.
( CRT ) to test the BIP. Based on data obtained from the three-stage evaluation,
the BIP passed the CRT testing protocol for accuracy, consistency, relative
safety and effectiveness.  
 In July 2012, the Company signed a five-year development,
supply and manufacturing agreement with a subcontractor to Manufacture the
BIP. 
 In November 2012, the Company obtained a United States
Department of Transportation number (DOT#) required in order for the Company to
ship BIP rounds.  
 17  

In 2012, the Company began the development of five new
less-lethal ammunition rounds. These new rounds will be a modified version of
the BIP, four of which carry a payload, including; BIP MP (temporary
powder-based marking agent), BIP ML (semi-permanent liquid marking agent), BIP
OC (Oleoresin Capsicum - a pepper spray powder), BIP MO (malodorant liquid), and
the BIP TR (training round). 
   2013    
 The Company moved its full manufacturing and supply chain
operations to the BIP manufacturer, a supply manufacturing and engineering
company, in the Boston, MA area. 
 The Company undertook an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in
January and became a public reporting issuer on the TSX-Venture Exchange in
September 2013. 
   2014    
 SDI began another globally recognized testing protocol with a
military agency called HECOE (the Human Effects Centre of Excellence). This
world-renowned agency is located in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in
partnership with the US Joint Non-lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD). This group
conducts research to assist Non-lethal Weapon (NLW) Program Managers across the
U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in assessing effectiveness and risks of NLWs.
The positive conclusion of this testing allows DOD to purchase SDI rounds.  
 April - SDI appointed Keith Morrison to the board of directors
as non-executive Chairman  
 May - SDI s BIP rounds were used at the Mock Prison Riot in
West Virginia. Law enforcement and correctional services officers provided
feedback on new technologies (such as SDI s products) to assist in the
effectiveness of their jobs. 
 August - The Company completed the issuance of 1,549
convertible unsecured debentures at $1,000 per debenture for gross proceeds of
$1,549,000 (the  Private Placement ).  
 October - Security Devices International Inc. announced that
the Company and a division of Abrams Airborne Manufacturing Inc. (AAMI), namely
Milkor USA (MUSA), have agreed to partner for a joint cross-selling / marketing
initiative. 
 November - The Company named Karim Kanji to the board of
directors as an independent member. 
 SDI has sold their BIP products into nine new agencies during
the fiscal year of 2014 including Sheriff Departments, Correctional Services,
and SWAT teams in; Saskatoon, SK, Watertown, SD, Abbotsford, BC, Sacramento, CA,
Kingston, ON, Rustburg, VA, Orlando, FL, Montreal, QC, and Bedford, VA. These
agencies are additions to SDI s customer base that have adopted its 40mm
less-lethal rounds. 
   2015    
 In January 2015, SDI commenced a public relations program and
through the year, SDI has been featured in over 700 media outlets globally,
including live interviews on FOX television, News One in New York, and CP24 in
Toronto.

March - SDI was invited to speak at the Launch festival in San
Francisco, to present their innovative less-lethal technology during a panel
discussion on the future of policing. The Launch festival focuses on start-up
and emerging technology companies and the festival was streamed to approximately
4 million viewers.  
 During the second quarter, SDI attended the American Jail
Association s annual conference in North Carolina and performed a live fire
demonstration to numerous State and local Agencies while in North Carolina.  
 During Q2, SDI also attended the Canadian Tactical Conference
in Collingwood, Ontario as well as the New York Tactical Conference in Verona,
New York.  
 Through SDI s distributor (U.S. Tactical Supply  GSA) the
Company was able to leverage their relationship to facilitate a live-fire
demonstration for the Pentagon Protection Force in Alexandria, Virginia.  
 In May - SDI participated in the  Mock Prison Riot  which takes
place annually at a decommissioned penitentiary in Moundsville, West Virginia.
The Mock Prison Riot is a four-day, comprehensive law enforcement and
corrections tactical and technology experience, including 40,000 square feet of
exhibit space, training scenarios, technology demonstrations, certification
workshops, a Skills Competition, and unlimited opportunities for feedback and
networking on a global scale.  
 SDI enhanced their customer base in the quarter by adding 9 new
agencies in multiple States and Provinces both in Canada and the US.  
 SDI staff attended the Ohio Tactical officers conference in
June where the Company not only had a full exhibit booth set up to bring
awareness to SDI s full line of less lethal 40MM products but also conducted
live fire demonstrations to several agencies. These agencies had requested
seeing the projectiles fired to move forward with evaluation of SDI s products
for potential inclusion in their less lethal arsenal.  
 July - SDI was invited to present the company s full line of
products to the New York City Police Department. Representatives of SDI attended
the NYPD range and conducted in-class presentations followed by a live fire
demonstration showcasing the full line on 40MM products that SDI can offer for
Law Enforcement operational missions.  
 July - The Associated Press ( AP ), conducted interviews with
SDI management and attended SDI s manufacturing partners  location for an in
depth look at the company and the technology. The AP completed a story on the
uniqueness of the product line and the increased element of safety that SDI s
products offer, and released the story to the newswire, where it was picked up
by approximately 800 media outlets, worldwide.  
 August - SDI was invited to present to the Toronto Police
Service ( TPS ), who are currently exploring less lethal options for front line
officers. A full presentation was given to decision makers of the TPS and a
follow-up live fire demonstration is to occur.  
 September   SDI conducted their Annual General Meeting and
shareholders approved the following:

    plan.   

5)  
     
       Approval of an amendment to the Company s articles to
      prohibit the issuance of shares of preferred stock having multiple voting
      attributes.    
 In FY2015, SDI added 24 new Law Enforcement and Correctional
Agencies to its paid customer base. The Company as at fiscal yearend holds 40
agencies as customers.  
 19  

Q1 FY2016      
 In December 2015, SDI was invited to conduct a full product
briefing and live fire demonstration for key Management with the United Sates
Federal Bureau of Prisons. SDI was able to showcase the innovation of the BIP
family of products and demonstrate the clear difference between SDI s products
and other products on the market. 
 In January 2016, SDI management attended the SHOT show in Las
Vegas and met with numerous existing partners and explored future partnerships
with several other Industry leaders.  
 During the SHOT show SDI s rounds were used by AAMI, an
existing partner of SDI, during a new product innovation range day that was
attended by the majority of Companies in the firearms industry.  
 During Q1, SDI is pleased to announce that it received its
first sale of 40MM launchers to a Law Enforcement Agency. This is an important
step for SDI to be seen as having the availability to access other less lethal
products to fulfil customer requests.  
 In January, SDI and Clyde Armory, signed a distribution
agreement whereas Clyde will offer SDI s product line to Law Enforcement
customers in their catchment area. Clyde is a full service gun store which
supplies firearms, ammunition and accessories to Law Enforcement and Civilian
customers. They are based in Athens, Georgia.  
 During this quarter, the non-exclusive renewable Technology
License and Supply Agreement that was signed with United Tactical Solutions on
April 17, 2015, was terminated by SDI management effective February 25, 2016.
 
 On February 29, 2016, SDI signed a term sheet with an existing
defense technology (less lethal) company to acquire that Company. This
acquisition, if completed, will give SDI a diversified line of less lethal
munitions, launchers and accessories as well as opening domestic and global
distribution channels. 
   Q2 FY2016    
 During the second quarter of 2016, the Company continued to
pursue the targeted acquisition through several funding sources, and financing
structures. Subsequent to the quarter, on July 8, 2016, the Company announced
that it had identified a number of items in the target company s (the  Target )
financial statements that raised concerns in support of the negotiated price of
the transaction. SDI has terminated discussions with the Target at this
time. 
 Subsequent to the quarter, the Company announced that Gregory
Sullivan has resigned as President and CEO to pursue other opportunities,
effective July 15, 2016. Dean Thrasher, the current COO and a member of the SDI
board of directors will assume the interim role of President and CEO. Mr.
Sullivan will remain on the board of directors until his replacement is

 The Company wishes to inform the market that a Schedule 13D was
filed with the SEC on June 8, 2016 by SDI s largest group of shareholders in the
US, holding approximately 10,474,522 shares. The 13D filing by the  reporting
persons  relates to the maximizing of shareholder value with the intention of
engaging more substantively with management, the board of directors and other
relevant parties on matters concerning the business, assets, capitalization,
operations and strategy of SDI. The 13D filing says that the reporting person
may also discuss strategic alternatives with interested parties to propose or
consider extraordinary transactions including joint ventures, mergers or a sale
transaction of the Company.  
   Q3 FY2016    
 During Q3 2016 SDI announced that it has terminated its
proposed acquisition of a less-lethal company, as previously released on May 13,
2016, and April 21, 2016.  
 During the Company s due diligence process, SDI identified a
number of items in the target company s (the  Target ) financial statements that
raised concerns in support of the negotiated price of the transaction. SDI
terminated discussions with the Target during this quarter.  
 SDI s management continues to look for acquisitions and
strategic partnerships in the less-lethal sector, to broaden its product
offering and increase its distribution reach. SDI is currently in preliminary
discussions to license its collapsible technology to other less lethal market
participants. SDI s objective is to both (1) increase revenues and (2) gain
greater market acceptance for the BIP.  
 During Q3 the Company announced the signing of a sales and
distribution agreement with the Bob Barker Company ( Bob Barker ), the nation s
preeminent correctional services supplier, for distribution of SDI s products
through their Officers Only distribution network.  
 A division of the Bob Barker Company,  Officers Only  is a
reliable source for quality apparel and offers a broad and diverse product
lineup of protective and essential equipment that are brand recognized and
trusted by law enforcement, corrections, military and public service office. SDI
will continue to look for qualified distributors as part of its new sales and
marketing strategy with a goal of tripling the number of SDI distributors by the
end of 2017.  
 Effective September 15, 2016 Allen Ezer resigned as Executive
Vice President to pursue other opportunities. He will remain as a Director until
the upcoming Annual General Meeting. Northeast Industrial Partners has taken on
the sales position of Mr. Ezer in the interim. Subsequent to the quarter, SDI
reported that it has made the first share issuance to Northeast Industrial
Partners under the consulting agreement announced on June 20, 2016. SDI issued
488,851 common shares at a deemed price of $ 0.1023 (CAD $0.1322) per share to
satisfy the payment of USD $50,000 due on August 15, 2016. The shares will be
subject to a four-month hold period expiring on January 13, 2017, and will not
vest until May 2017.  
 21  

The issuance of shares to Northeast Industrial Partners is the
first of four such issuances to occur over the period ending May 15, 2017, as
described in the June 20, 2016 news release. 
 During Q3, SDI appointed Bryan Ganz to the board of directors.
With the appointment of Mr. Ganz to the board of directors, the previously
announced resignation of Greg Sullivan (previous CEO) as a director becomes
effective. 
 Operations  
 The Company has reduced its production costs of its most
popular products during the last quarter. These cost reductions will support
SDI s sales blitz efforts to continue to gain market penetration in the law
enforcement, correctional services and private sector segments.  
 Website Update  
 SDI has updated its website to continue to manage its digital
presence, as well as maintain its top positioning in search engines for the
less-lethal industry. The Company has also revised it messaging to respond to
recent global law enforcement confrontations, such as incidents in the US, South
America and in Europe.  
  Products   
 SDI s business is the development, manufacture and sale of
less-lethal ammunition. This ammunition is used by the military, correctional
services, and police agencies for crowd control.  
 The Company has two products:  

a)  
     
       The Company has developed the BIP, a blunt impact
      projectile which uses pain compliance to control a target. The Company has
      developed six versions of the standard BIP, five of which contain a
      payload and one of which is a cheaper cost, training round. A payload is
      an internal medium within the BIP, holding a liquid or powder
      substance.   

b)  
     
       The Company has undertaken substantial work to develop
      the WEP, a wireless electric projective which releases an electrical pulse
      that induces a muscle spasm and causes the target to fall to the ground
      helpless.    
  Intellectual Property   
 Five patent applications, four non-provisional and one
provisional, have been filed by the Company with the U.S. Patent Office. The
Patents have been granted on the four non-provisional patents. 
 Non-Provisional (granted patents):  
 (a) Less-lethal Projectile: This issued patent relates to the
Company s distinctive collapsible ammunition head technology that absorbs
kinetic energy of the projectile upon impact. The Corporation s collapsible head
is used in both the BIP and the WEP.  
 (b) Electronic Circuitry for Incapacitating a Living Target:
This issued patent relates to the electronic circuitry incapacitation system
which forms part of the WEP. The patent describes an electronic circuit which
provides an electrical incapacitation current to a living target. 
 22  

(c) Less-lethal Wireless Stun Projectile System for
Immobilizing a Target by Neuro-Muscular Disruption: This issued patent describes
the process by which the WEP operates with its attachment system to halt a
target through a neuro-muscular-disruption system.  
 (d) Autonomous Operation of a Less-lethal Projectile: This
patent describes a motion sensing system within the WEP. The sensor will monitor
movement of the target and enable the electrical output until the target is
subdued. The electrical pulse is programmed for an exact time-frame to
specifications of the user.  
 Provisional Patent:  
 (e) Payload carrying arrangement for a non-lethal projectile:
This Provisional patent relates to the process of carrying liquid and powder
payloads in the head of the BIP munitions that upon impact release from the head
and are dispersed upon the target.  
 The Company s policy has been to write off cost incurred in
connection with non-provisional and provisional patent costs as they are
incurred as a recoverability of such expenditure is uncertain.

Going Concern    
 The Company has incurred a cumulative loss of $27,937,161 from
inception to August 31, 2016. The Company has funded operations through the
issuance of capital stock and convertible debentures. The Company has started to
generate revenue from operations. However, it still expects to incur significant
expenses before becoming profitable. The Company s future success is dependent
upon its ability to raise sufficient capital or generate adequate revenue, to
cover its ongoing operating expenses, and also to continue to develop and be
able to profitably market its products. These factors raise substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.  
 In addition to raising funds in the prior years, the Company
raised $878,328 by issue of Convertible Debentures during the year ended
November 30, 2011 and $910,000 during the year ended November 30, 2012. In
addition, the Company raised $649,750 by issuance of 2,165,834 common shares
during the year ended November 30, 2012. On August 15, 2013, the Company filed
an amended and restated final prospectus (the  Prospectus ) in Canada, in the
provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario for listing its shares in
these provinces in Canada. On August 27, 2013 the Company completed an initial
public offering to raise gross proceeds of CAD $3,993,980 (US $3,794,280)
through the issuance of 9,984,950 Common Shares at a price of CAD $0.40 (US
$0.38) per Common Share (the  Issue Price ). During the year ended November 30,
2014, the Company issued $1,398,592 (CAD $1,549,000) face value 12% convertible
debentures with a term to August 6, 2017 (the  Maturity Date ) and raised net
$1,241,299. In 2015, the Company raised $2,500,000 through the issuance of
7,575,757 common shares and also issued 105,600 common shares on exercise of
warrants for $16,775 and 35,000 common shares on exercise of options for $6,995.
The Company s common shares commenced trading on the TSX Venture Exchange

EXCLUSIVE SUPPLY AGREEMENT  
 The Company entered into a Development, Supply and
Manufacturing Agreement with the BIP Manufacturer on July 25, 2012. This
Agreement provides the Company to order and purchase only from the BIP
Manufacturer certain 40MM assemblies and components for use by the Company to
produce less-lethal and training projectiles as described in the Agreement. The
Agreement is for a term of five years with an automatic extension for an

  Revenue Recognition   
 The Company s revenue recognition policies follow common
practice in the manufacturing industry. The Company records revenue when it is
realized, or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue to be
realized, or realizable and earned, when the following revenue recognition
requirements are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the products
or services have been accepted by the customer via delivery or installation
acceptance; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is
probable. For product sales, the Company determines that the earnings process is
complete when title, risk of loss and the right to use product has transferred
to the customer. 
  Subsequent events  
 Effective May 1, 2016, the Company executed a one-year
consulting agreement with a Corporation. For the consultant services, the
consultant was paid cash for $50,000 and issued a value of $200,000 in Company s
stock in four quarterly instalments over the 12-month period ending May 15,

  Outstanding share data   
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 55,104,493 issued and
outstanding shares of common stock. 
 30  

Risk Factors    
  Additional Financing   
 The Corporation does not have adequate revenue to fund all of
its operational needs and may require additional financing to continue its
operations if it is unable to generate substantial revenue growth. There can be
no assurance that such financing will be available at all or on favorable terms.
Failure to generate substantial revenue growth may result in the Corporation
looking to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite
postponement of the Corporation s deployment of its products, resulting in the
possible dilution. Any such financing will dilute the ownership interest of the
Corporation s shareholders at the time of the financing, and may dilute the
value of their shareholdings.  
  General Venture Company Risks   
 The Common Shares must be considered highly speculative due to
the nature of the Corporation s business, the early stage of its deployment, its
current financial position and ongoing requirements for capital. An investment
in the Common Shares should only be considered by those persons who can afford a
total loss of investment, and is not suited to those investors who may need to
dispose of their investment in a timely fashion. Investors should consult with
their own professional advisors to assess the legal, financial and other aspects
of an investment in Common Shares.  
  Uncertainty of Revenue Growth   
 There can be no assurance that the Corporation can generate
substantial revenue growth, or that any revenue growth that is achieved can be
sustained. Revenue growth that the Corporation has achieved or may achieve may
not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, the Corporation may
increase further its operating expenses in order to fund increase its sales and
marketing efforts and increase its administrative resources in anticipation of
future growth. To the extent that increases in such expenses precede or are not
subsequently followed by increased revenues, the Corporation s business,
operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
 
  Dependence on Management and Key Personnel   
 The Corporation is dependent on certain members of its
management. The loss of the services of one or more of them could adversely
affect the Corporation. The Corporation s ability to maintain its competitive
position is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified
managerial, specialized technical, manufacturing, sales and marketing personnel.
There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to continue to
recruit and retain such personnel. The inability of the Corporation to recruit
and retain such personnel would adversely affect the Corporation s operations
and product development.  
  Dependence on Key Suppliers   
 The Corporation may be able to purchase certain key components
of its products from a limited number of suppliers. Failure of a supplier to
provide sufficient quantities on favorable terms or on a timely basis could
result in possible lost sales.  
  Product Liability   
 The Corporation may be subject to proceedings or claims that
may arise in the ordinary conduct of the business, which could include product
and service warranty claims, which could be substantial. If its products fail to
perform as warranted and it fails to quickly resolve product quality or
performance issues in a timely manner, sales may be lost and it may be forced to
pay damages. Any failure to meet customer requirements could materially affect
its business, results of operations and financial condition. The occurrence of
product defects and the inability to correct errors could result in the delay or
loss of market acceptance of its products, material warranty expense, diversion
of technological and other resources from its product development efforts, and
the loss of credibility with customers, manufacturer s representatives,
distributors, value added resellers, systems integrators, original equipment
manufacturers and end-users, any of which could have a material adverse effect
on the Corporation s business, operating results and financial conditions.  
 31  

The Corporation currently has general liability insurance that
includes product liability coverage. There is no assurance this insurance policy
will cover all potential claims which may have a material adverse effect on the
business or financial condition of the Corporation. A product recall could have
a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the
Corporation. 
  Strategic Alliances   
 The Corporation relies upon, and expects to rely upon,
strategic alliances with original equipment manufacturers for the manufacturing
and distribution of its products. There can be no assurance that such strategic
alliances can be achieved or will achieve their goals.  
  Marketing and Distribution Capabilities   
 In order to commercialize its technology, the Corporation must
either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical
expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or arrange for third
parties to perform these services. In order to market any of its products, the
Corporation must either acquire or develop a sales and distribution
infrastructure. The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution
infrastructure would require substantial resources, which may divert the
attention of its Management and key personnel, and defer its product development
and deployment efforts. To the extent that the Corporation enters into marketing
and sales arrangements with other companies, its revenues will depend on the
efforts of others. These efforts may not be successful. If the Corporation fails
to develop substantial sales, marketing and distribution channels, or to enter
into arrangements with third parties for those purposes, it will experience
delays in product sales and incur increased costs.  
  Rapid Technological Development   
 The markets for the Corporation s products and services are
characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards,
which could result in product obsolescence or short product life cycles.
Accordingly, the Corporation s success is dependent upon its ability to
anticipate technological changes in the industries it serves and to successfully
identify, obtain, develop and market new products that satisfy evolving industry
requirements. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will successfully
develop new products or enhance and improve its existing products or that any
new products and enhanced and improved existing products will achieve market
acceptance. Further, there can be no assurance that competitors will not market
products that have perceived advantages over the Corporation s products or which
render the products currently sold by the Corporation obsolete or less
marketable. Regardless of the Industry as a whole, the less lethal sector moves
somewhat slower in the adaptation and integration of new products.  
 The Corporation must commit significant resources to developing
new products before knowing whether its investments will result in products the
market will accept. To remain competitive, the Corporation may be required to
invest significantly greater resources then currently anticipated in research
and development and product enhancement efforts, and result in increased
operating expenses.  
  Competition   
 The Corporation s industry is highly competitive and composed
of many domestic and foreign companies. The Corporation has experienced and
expects to continue to experience, substantial competition from numerous
competitors whom it expects to continue to improve their products and
technologies. Competitors may announce and introduce new products, services or
enhancements that better meet the needs of end-users or changing industry
standards, or achieve greater market acceptance due to pricing, sales channels
or other factors. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly than the
Corporation to changes in end-user requirements and devote greater resources to
the enhancement, promotion and sale of their products.  
 32  

Regulation   
 The Corporation is subject to numerous federal, provincial,
state and local environmental, health and safety legislation and measures
relating to the manufacture of ammunition. There can be no assurance that the
Corporation will not experience difficulties with its efforts to comply with
applicable regulations as they change in the future or that its continued
compliance efforts (or failure to comply with applicable requirements) will not
have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s results of operations,
business, prospects and financial condition. The Corporation s continued
compliance with present and changing future laws could restrict the
Corporation s ability to modify or expand its facilities or continue production
and could require the Corporation to acquire costly equipment or to incur other
significant expense.  
  Intellectual Property   
 The Corporation s ability to compete effectively will depend,
in part, on its ability to maintain the proprietary nature of its technology and
manufacturing processes. Although the Corporation considers certain of its
product designs as well as manufacturing processes involving certain of its
products to be proprietary, patents or copyrights do not protect all design and
manufacturing processes. The Corporation has adopted procedures to protect its
intellectual property and maintain secrecy of its confidential business
information and trade secrets. However, there can be no assurance that such
procedures will afford complete protection of such intellectual property,
confidential business information and trade secrets. There can be no assurance
that the Corporation s competitors will not independently develop technologies
that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Corporation s technology.
 
 To protect the Corporation s intellectual property, it may
become involved in litigation, which could result in substantial expenses,
divert the attention of its management, cause significant delays and materially
disrupt the conduct of its business.  
  Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights   
 While the Corporation believes that its products and other
intellectual property do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third
parties, its commercial success depends, in part, upon the Corporation not
infringing intellectual property rights of others. A number of the Corporation s
competitors and other third parties have been issued or may have filed patent
applications or may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights for
technologies similar to those utilized by the Corporation. Some of these patents
may grant very broad protection to the owners of the patents. The Corporation
has not undertaken a review to determine whether any existing third party
patents or the issuance of any third party patents would require the Corporation
to alter its technology, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The
Corporation may become subject to claims by third parties that its technology
infringes their intellectual property rights due to the growth of products in
its target markets, the overlap in functionality of those products and the
prevalence of products. The Corporation may become subject to these claims
either directly or through indemnities against these claims that it provides to
end-users, manufacturer s representatives, distributors, value added resellers,
system integrators and original equipment manufacturers.  
 Litigation may be necessary to determine the scope,
enforceability and validity of third party proprietary rights or to establish
the Corporation s proprietary rights. Some of its competitors have, or are
affiliated with companies having, substantially greater resources than the
Corporation and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex
intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for a longer period of
time than the Corporation. Regardless of their merit, any such claims could be
time consuming to evaluate and defend, result in costly litigation, cause
product shipment delays or stoppages, divert management s attention and focus
away from the business, subject the Corporation to significant liabilities and
equitable remedies, including injunctions, require the Corporation to enter into
costly royalty or licensing agreements and require the Corporation to modify or
stop using infringing technology.  
 The Corporation may be prohibited from developing or
commercializing certain technologies and products unless it obtains a license
from a third party. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain any
such license on commercially favorable terms or at all. If it does not obtain
such a license, it could be required to cease the sale of certain of its
products.  
 33  

Health and Safety   
 Health and safety issues related to its products may arise that
could lead to litigation or other action against the Corporation or to
regulation of certain of its product components. The Corporation may be required
to modify its technology and may not be able to do so. It may also be required
to pay damages that may reduce its profitability and adversely affect its
financial condition. Even if these concerns prove to be baseless, the resulting
negative publicity could affect the Corporation s ability to market certain of
its products and, in turn, could harm its business and results from operations.
 
  Stress in the global financial system may adversely affect
the Corporation s operations in ways that may be hard to predict or to defend
against   
 Recent events have demonstrated that businesses and industries
throughout the world are very tightly connected to each other. Thus, events
seemingly unrelated to the Corporation, or to its industry, may adversely affect
its finances or operations in ways that are hard to predict or defend against.
For example, credit contraction in financial markets may hurt the Corporation s
ability to access credit when it is needed or rapid changes in foreign exchange
rates may adversely affect financial results. Finally, a reduction in credit,
combined with reduced economic activity, may adversely affect businesses and
industries that collectively constitute a significant portion of the
Corporation s customer base. As a result, these customers may need to reduce
their purchases of the Corporation s products, or there may be greater
difficulty in receiving payment for the products that these customers purchase
from the Corporation. Any of these events, or any other events caused by turmoil
in world financial markets, may have a material adverse effect on the business,
operating results, and financial condition. 
  Insurance and Uninsured Risks   
 The Corporation s business is subject to a number of risks and
hazards including industrial accidents, labor disputes and changes in the
regulatory environment. Such occurrences could result in damage to equipment,
personal injury or death, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although
the Corporation maintains liability insurance in amounts which it considers
adequate, the nature of these risks is such that liabilities might exceed policy
limits, the liabilities and hazards might not be insurable, or the Corporation
may elect not to insure against such liabilities due to high premium costs or
other reasons, in which event the Corporation could incur significant costs that
could have a materially adverse effect upon its financial position.  
  Conflicts of Interest   
 Certain directors and officers of the Corporation are or may
become associated with other companies in the same or related industries which
may give rise to conflicts of interest. Directors who have a material interest
in any person who is a party to a material contract or a proposed material
contract with the Corporation are required, subject to certain exceptions, to
disclose that interest and generally abstain from voting on any resolution to
approve the contract. In addition, the directors and the officers are required
to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the
Corporation. The directors and officers of the Corporation have either other
full-time employment or other business or time restrictions placed on them and
accordingly, the Corporation will not be the only business enterprise of these
directors and officers.  
  Dividend Policy   
 The Corporation has not paid dividends in the past and has no
plans to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. The future dividend policy of
the Corporation will be determined by its directors.  
  Lack of Active Market   
 There can be no assurance that an active market for the Common
Shares will continue and any increased demand to buy or sell the Common Shares
can create volatility in price and volume. 
 34  

Market Price of Common Shares   
 There can be no assurance that an active market for the Common
Shares will be sustained. Securities of small and midcap companies have
experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated
to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved. These
factors include global economic developments and market perceptions of the
attractiveness of certain industries. The price per Common Share is also likely
to be affected by change in the Corporation s financial condition or results of
operations as reflected in its quarterly filings. Other factors unrelated to the
performance of the Corporation that may have an effect on the price of Common
Shares include the following: the extent of analytical coverage available to
subscribers concerning the business of the Corporation may be limited if
investment banks with research capabilities do not follow the Corporation s
securities; lessening in trading volume and general market interest in the
Corporation s securities may affect a subscriber s ability to trade significant
numbers of Common Shares, the size of the Corporation s public float may limit
the ability of some institutions to invest in the Corporation s securities; a
substantial decline in the price of the Common Shares that persists for a
significant period of time could cause the Corporation s securities to be
delisted from the exchange, further reducing market liquidity. If an active
market for the Common Shares does not continue, the liquidity of a subscriber s
investment may be limited and the price of the Common Shares may decline. If
such a market does not develop, subscribers may lose their entire investment in
the Common Shares.  
  Political Regulatory Risks   
 Any changes in government policy may result in changes to laws
affecting the sale of the Corporation s products. This may affect the
Corporation s ability to ship product in the future. The possibility that future
governments may adopt substantially different policies, may also effect the
Corporation s operations. Local governments in all countries the Corporation
deals with issue end user certificates to purchase or receive live ammunition
from the Corporation. It is the decision of these countries in the Middle East,
the United States, Canada, Europe, and the Baltics whether or not they will take
possession or purchase such munitions. 
  Dividends   
 The Corporation has not, since the date of its incorporation,
declared or paid any dividends on its Common Shares and does not currently
intend to pay dividends. Earnings, if any, will be retained to finance further
growth and development of the business of the Corporation.  
   Legal proceedings

  Item 4.        
 Controls and Procedures.  
             (a)
SDI maintains a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( 1934 Act ), is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by SDI
in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act, is accumulated and
communicated to SDI s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. As of August 31, 2016, SDI s Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of SDI s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation,
SDI s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that
SDI s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the following
material weakness: 
 35  

Inherent in any small business is the pervasive problem
involving segregation of duties. Since SDI has a small accounting department,
segregation of duties cannot be completely accomplished at this stage in its
corporate lifecycle. 
 In order to correct the foregoing material weakness, we have
taken and are taking the following remediation measures that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting:  
 
   We have Directors with business experience and spending time with the
  business.
   We have established an audit committee of our board of directors. The
  audit committee will provide oversight of our accounting and financial
  reporting;
   We have a Chief Financial Officer who has knowledge of, and experience
  regarding, U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements.   
 Accordingly, SDI s management has added compensating controls
to reduce and minimize the risk of a material misstatement in SDI s annual and
interim financial statements.  
             (b)
 Changes in Internal Controls . There were no changes in SDI s internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal
control over financial reporting.
