Explanatory Note 
  This Quarterly Report combines the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q ( Quarterly Report ) for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. ( HTA ), a Maryland corporation, and Healthcare Trust of America Holdings, LP (   HTALP   ), a Delaware limited partnership.  Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Quarterly Report to  we,   us,   our,   the Company  or  our Company  refer to HTA and   HTALP  , collectively, and all references to  common stock  shall refer to the Class A common stock of HTA.  
  HTA operates as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) and is the general partner of   HTALP  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , HTA owned a   97.0%   partnership interest in   HTALP  , and other limited partners, including some of HTA s directors, executive officers and their affiliates, owned the remaining partnership interest (including the long-term incentive plan ( LTIP ) units) in   HTALP  .  As the sole general partner of   HTALP  , HTA has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for   HTALP   s day-to-day management and control, including its compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) filing requirements. 
  We believe it is important to understand the few differences between HTA and   HTALP   in the context of how we operate as an integrated consolidated company.  HTA operates in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which   HTALP   and its subsidiaries hold substantially all of the assets.  HTA s only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of   HTALP  .  As a result, HTA does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of   HTALP  , issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debts of   HTALP  .    HTALP   conducts the operations of the business and issues publicly-traded debt, but has no publicly-traded equity.  Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by HTA, which are generally contributed to   HTALP   in exchange for partnership units of   HTALP  ,   HTALP   generates the capital required for the business through its operations and by direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of its partnership units. 
  Noncontrolling interests, stockholders  equity and partners  capital are the primary areas of difference between the condensed consolidated financial statements of HTA and   HTALP  .  Limited partnership units in   HTALP   are accounted for as partners  capital in   HTALP   s condensed consolidated balance sheets and as noncontrolling interest reflected within equity in HTA s condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The differences between HTA s stockholders  equity and   HTALP   s partners  capital are due to the differences in the equity issued by HTA and   HTALP  , respectively. 
  The Company believes combining the Quarterly Reports of HTA and   HTALP  , including the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, into this single Quarterly Report results in the following benefits: 
             
    enhances stockholders  understanding of HTA and   HTALP   by enabling stockholders to view the business as a whole in the same manner that management views and operates the business; 
                
    eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure in this Quarterly Report applies to both HTA and   HTALP  ; and 
                
    creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of a single combined Quarterly Report instead of two separate Quarterly Reports. 
     In order to highlight the material differences between HTA and   HTALP  , this Quarterly Report includes sections that separately present and discuss areas that are materially different between HTA and   HTALP  , including: 
             
    the condensed consolidated financial statements; 
                
    certain accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, including   Note 7 - Debt  ,   Note 10 - Stockholders  Equity and Partners  Capital  ,   Note 12 - Per Share Data of HTA   and   Note 13 - Per Unit Data of HTALP  ;  
                
    the Funds From Operations ( FFO ) and Normalized FFO in Part 1, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report; 
                
    the controls and procedures in Part 1, Item 4 of this Quarterly Report; and 
                
    the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer included as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this Quarterly Report.  
     In the sections of this Quarterly Report that combine disclosure for HTA and   HTALP  , this Quarterly Report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company.  Although   HTALP   (directly or indirectly through one of its subsidiaries) is generally the entity that enters into contracts, holds assets and issues or incurs debt, management believes this presentation is appropriate for the reasons set forth above and because the business of the Company is a single integrated enterprise operated through   HTALP  .

  1. Organization and Description of Business  
  HTA, a Maryland corporation, and   HTALP  , a Delaware limited partnership, were incorporated or formed, as applicable, on   April 20, 2006  .  HTA operates as a REIT and is the general partner of   HTALP  , which is the operating partnership.  As of   September 30, 2016  , HTA owned a   97.0%   partnership interest and other limited partners, including some of HTA s directors, executive officers and their affiliates, owned the remaining partnership interest (including the LTIP units) in   HTALP  .  As the sole general partner of   HTALP  , HTA has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for   HTALP   s day-to-day management and control.  HTA operates in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which   HTALP   and its subsidiaries hold substantially all of the assets.  HTA s only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of   HTALP  .  As a result, HTA does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of   HTALP  , issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debts of   HTALP  .    HTALP   conducts the operations of the business and issues publicly-traded debt, but has no publicly-traded equity.   
  HTA is one of the largest publicly-traded REITs focused on medical office buildings ( MOBs ) in the United States based on gross leasable area ( GLA ).  HTA conducts substantially all of its operations through HTALP.  We invest in MOBs that will serve the future of healthcare delivery, and these MOBs are primarily located on health system campuses, near university medical centers, or in core community outpatient locations.  We also focus on our key markets that have certain demographic and macro-economic trends and where we can utilize our institutional property management and leasing platform to generate strong tenant relationships and operating cost efficiencies.  Our primary objective is to maximize stockholder value with disciplined growth through strategic investments that provide an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders by consistently increasing our cash flow.  In pursuing this objective, we: (i) seek internal growth through proactive asset management, leasing and property management oversight; (ii) target accretive acquisitions of MOBs in markets with attractive demographics that complement our existing portfolio; and (iii) actively manage our balance sheet to maintain flexibility with conservative leverage.  HTA has qualified to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and intends to continue to be taxed as a REIT. 
  Since 2006, we have invested   $4.2 billion   to create a portfolio of MOBs and other healthcare assets consisting of approximately   17.6 million   square feet of GLA throughout the U.S.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   97%   of our portfolio, based on GLA, was located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally or regionally recognized healthcare systems.  Our portfolio is diversified geographically across   31   states, with no state having more than   13%   of our total GLA as of   September 30, 2016  .  We are concentrated in   20   to   25   key markets that are experiencing higher economic and demographic trends, than other markets, on average, that we expect will drive demand for MOBs.  Approximately   92%   of our portfolio, based on GLA, is located in top   75   metropolitan statistical areas ( MSAs ) including concentrations in: Albany, Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Charleston, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Greenville, Hartford/New Haven, Honolulu, Houston, Indianapolis, Miami, Orange County/Los Angeles, Orlando, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Tampa and White Plains.  
  Our principal executive offices are located at 16435 North Scottsdale Road, Suite 320, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85254. 
   
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding our condensed consolidated financial statements.  Such condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes are the representations of our management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.  These accounting policies conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Basis of Presentation  
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries and any consolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ).  All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

Interim Unaudited Financial Data 
  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC rules and regulations.  Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in our opinion, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods.  Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such results may be less favorable for the full year.  Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.      There have been no significant changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , except as noted below regarding the adoption of U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis and ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.   
  Principles of Consolidation 
  As of January 1, 2016, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, as described below in  Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements , which simplifies consolidation accounting by reducing the number of consolidation models and changing various aspects of current GAAP, including certain consolidation criteria for VIEs.  The consolidated financial statements include our accounts of those of our subsidiaries and consolidated joint venture arrangements.  The portions of the operating partnership not owned by us are presented as non-controlling interests in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations, consolidated statements of equity, and consolidated statements of changes in partners  capital.  The portions of other joint venture arrangements not owned by us are presented as redeemable non-controlling interests in our consolidated balance sheets.  In addition, as described in   Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business  , certain third parties have been issued limited partner units in HTALP ( OP Units ).  Holders of OP Units are considered to be non-controlling interest holders in HTALP and their ownership interests are reflected as equity in the consolidated balance sheets.  Further, a portion of the earnings and losses of HTALP are allocated to non-controlling interest holders based on their respective ownership percentages.  Upon conversion of OP Units to common stock, any difference between the fair value of common shares issued and the carrying value of the OP Units converted is recorded as a component of equity.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were approximately   4.3 million   and   1.9 million  , respectively, of OP Units issued and outstanding. 
  VIEs are entities where investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or where equity investors, as a group, lack one of the following: (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance; (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity; and (iii) the right to receive the expected returns of the entity.  We consolidate our investment in VIEs when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary.  A primary beneficiary is one that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity.  Our analysis of FASB ASU 2015-02 was concluded that our operating partnership and other joint venture arrangements are VIEs, as the limited partners in the related partnerships, although entitled to vote on certain matters, do not possess kick-out rights or substantive participating rights.  Accordingly, we consolidate our interest in the operating partnership and other joint venture arrangements.  Although, as we hold what is deemed a majority voting interest in the operating partnership and other joint venture arrangements, it qualifies for the exemption from providing certain of the disclosure requirements associated with investments in VIEs.  We will evaluate on an ongoing basis the need to consolidate entities based on the standards set forth in GAAP as described above.   
  Investments in Real Estate 
  Depreciation expense of buildings and improvements for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $31.1 million     and   $26.9 million  , respectively.  Depreciation expense of buildings and improvements for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $86.6 million   and   $74.9 million  , respectively.

Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration (i.e., payment) to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.  In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 along with the ability to early adopt as of the original effective date.  We do not anticipate early adoption and we are evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.  ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  The amendments in ASU 2015-02 affect the following areas: (i) limited partnerships and similar legal entities; (ii) evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest; (iii) the effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination; (iv) the effect of related parties on the primary beneficiary determination; and (v) certain investment funds.  ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted.  We adopted ASU 2015-02 as of January 1, 2016.  The adoption had no material impact on our interests in joint venture arrangements.  Accordingly, there was no material impact on previous or current reporting periods  consolidated financial statements.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  ASU 2015-03 changes the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring these costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to include the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements.  ASU 2015-03 and 2015-15 are effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and requires retrospective application with early adoption permitted.  We adopted ASU 2015-03 and 2015-15 as of December 31, 2015.  As a result of the adoption, all deferred financing costs, excluding costs related to the unsecured revolving credit facility, were reclassed to debt.  Unsecured revolving credit facility costs remain classified as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets and will continue to be amortized over the remaining term.  The guidance requires retrospective adoption for all prior periods presented. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.  ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination has to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.  Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.  We adopted ASU 2015-16 as of January 1, 2016.  As a result of the adoption there was no material impact in the previous or current reporting periods  consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases.  ASU 2016-02 will supersede the existing guidance for lease accounting and states that companies will be required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  ASU 2016-02 requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand the nature of the entity s leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.  Within ASU 2016-02 lessor accounting remained fairly unchanged.  In adopting ASU 2016-02, companies will be required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.  We do not anticipate early adoption, however, we are evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Compensation Accounting.  ASU 2016-09 includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of accounting for share-based compensation which includes, but is not limited to, the requirement that excess tax benefits be recorded within the income statement as opposed to additional paid-in-capital and treated as an operating activity within the statement of cash flows.  In addition, ASU 2016-09 allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  We do not anticipate early adoption, however, we are evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326).  ASU 2016-13 is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recognition of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other such commitments.  ASU 2016-13 requires that financial statement assets measured at an amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted.  We do not anticipate early adoption, however, we are evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 includes multiple provisions intended to clarify various aspects of cash flow presentation by making eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  We do not anticipate early adoption, however, we are evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.

Unsecured Credit Agreement 
  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility 
  On   February 11, 2015  , we executed an amendment to the unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility (the  Unsecured Credit Agreement ) which increased the amount available under the unsecured revolving credit facility to   $850.0 million  .  The actual amount of credit available to us is a function of certain loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios set forth in the unsecured revolving credit facility.  The maximum principal amount of the unsecured revolving credit facility may be increased, subject to additional financing being provided by our existing lenders or new lenders being added to the unsecured revolving credit facility.  The unsecured revolving credit facility matures on   January 31, 2020   and is guaranteed by HTA.  
  Borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at a rate equal to adjusted   LIBOR  , plus a margin ranging from   0.88%   to   1.55%   per annum based on our credit rating.

Deferred Financing Costs  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the future amortization of deferred financing costs is as follows (in thousands):    

  We are required by the terms of our applicable debt agreements to meet various affirmative and negative covenants that we believe are customary for these types of facilities, such as limitations on the incurrence of debt by us and our subsidiaries that own unencumbered assets, limitations on the nature of   HTALP   s business, and limitations on distributions by   HTALP   and its subsidiaries that own unencumbered assets.  Our debt agreements also impose various financial covenants on us, such as a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value, a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges, a minimum tangible net worth covenant, a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value, rent coverage ratios and a minimum ratio of unencumbered net operating income to unsecured interest expense.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe that we were in compliance with all such financial covenants and reporting requirements.

There were no derivatives offset in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had derivatives subject to enforceable master netting arrangements which allowed for net cash settlement with the respective counterparties (in thousands): 

We have agreements with each of our interest rate swap derivative counterparties which provide that if we default on certain of our unsecured indebtedness, our counterparties could declare us in default on our interest rate swap derivative obligations resulting in an acceleration of the indebtedness.  In addition, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by our derivative counterparties.  We believe we mitigate the credit risk by entering into agreements with credit-worthy counterparties.  We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on interest rate swap derivative assets in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty.  In addition, our fair value of interest rate swap derivative liabilities is adjusted to reflect the impact of our credit quality.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no termination events or events of default related to our interest rate swaps. 
   
  9. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Litigation 
  We are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us, which if determined unfavorably to us, would have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    
  Environmental Matters 
  We follow the policy of monitoring our properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.  While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at our properties, we are not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to our properties that would have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Further, we are not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability at our properties that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency. 
  Other 
  Our other commitments and contingencies include the usual obligations of real estate owners and operators in the normal course of business.  In our opinion, these matters are not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  10. Stockholders  Equity and Partners  Capital 
  HTALP   s partnership agreement provides that it will distribute cash flow from operations and net sale proceeds to its partners in accordance with their overall ownership interests at such times and in such amounts as the general partner determines.  Dividend distributions are made such that a holder of   one   partnership unit in   HTALP   will receive distributions from   HTALP   in an amount equal to the dividend distributions paid to the holder of one share of HTA s common stock.  In addition, for each share of common stock issued or redeemed by HTA,   HTALP   issues or redeems a corresponding number of partnership units.

Financial Instruments Reported at Fair Value - Non-Recurring 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no     a  ssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The table below presents our assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of   December 31, 2015  , aggregated by the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy (in thousands): 

There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between levels.  We will record any such transfers at the end of the reporting period in which a change of event occurs that results in a transfer.  Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our interest rate swap derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with these instruments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties.  However, we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our interest rate swap derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to their overall valuation.  As a result, we have determined that our interest rate swap derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.    
  Financial Instruments Disclosed at Fair Value 
  We consider the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, tenant and other receivables, restricted cash and escrow deposits and accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, to approximate fair value for these financial instruments because of the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization.  All of these financial instruments are considered Level 2.   
  The fair value of debt is estimated using borrowing rates available to us with similar terms and maturities, which is considered a Level 2 input.    As of September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the debt was   $1,781.6 million   compared to the carrying value of   $1,712.6 million  .    As of December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the debt was   $1,619.7 million   compared to the carrying value of   $1,590.7 million  .

     Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act )).  Such statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies, prospects and estimates regarding future MOB market performance.  Additionally, such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as well as known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially and in adverse ways from those projected or anticipated.  Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods.  Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by the use of such terms as  expect,   project,   may,   should,   could,   would,   intend,   plan,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   continue,   opinion,   predict,   potential,   pro forma  or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date this Quarterly Report is filed with the SEC.  We cannot guarantee the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, and we do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. 
  Any such forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, are subject to unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, and are based on a number of assumptions involving judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately.  To the extent that our assumptions differ from actual results, our ability to meet such forward-looking statements, including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, provide dividends to stockholders and maintain the value of our real estate properties, may be significantly hindered.  Factors that might impair our ability to meet such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein.

Forward-looking statements express expectations of future events.  All forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected.  Due to these inherent uncertainties, our stockholders are urged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.  In addition, we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to projections over time, except as required by law. 
  These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.  Additional information concerning us and our business, including additional factors that could materially affect our financial results, is included herein and in our other filings with the SEC. 
  Executive Summary  
  HTA is one of the largest publicly-traded REITs focused on MOBs in the U.S. based on the GLA of its MOBs.  HTA conducts substantially all of its operations through HTALP.  We invest in MOBs that will serve the future of healthcare delivery, and these MOBs are primarily located on health system campuses, near university medical centers, or in core community outpatient locations.  We also focus on our key markets that have certain demographic and macro-economic trends and where we can utilize our institutional property management and leasing platform to generate strong tenant relationships and operating cost efficiencies.  Our primary objective is to maximize stockholder value with disciplined growth through strategic investments that provide an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders by consistently increasing our cash flow.  In pursuing this objective, we: (i) seek internal growth through proactive asset management, leasing and property management oversight; (ii) target accretive acquisitions of MOBs in markets with attractive demographics that complement our existing portfolio; and (iii) actively manage our balance sheet to maintain flexibility with conservative leverage.   
  Since 2006, we have invested   $4.2 billion   to create a portfolio of MOBs and other healthcare assets consisting of approximately   17.6 million   square feet of GLA throughout the U.S.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   97%   of our portfolio, based on GLA, was located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally or regionally recognized healthcare systems.  Our portfolio is diversified geographically across   31   states, with no state having more than   13%   of our total GLA as of   September 30, 2016  .  We are concentrated in 20 to 25 key markets that are experiencing higher economic and demographic trends, than other markets, on average, that we expect will drive demand for MOBs.  Approximately   92%   of our portfolio, based on GLA, is located in top 75 MSAs including concentrations in: Albany, Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Charleston, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Greenville, Hartford/New Haven, Honolulu, Houston, Indianapolis, Miami, Orange County/Los Angeles, Orlando, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Tampa and White Plains.  
  Company Highlights 
  Portfolio Operating Performance  
              
    For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , n  et income attributable to common stockholders was     $0.04     per diluted share, or     $6.4 million  , compared to     $0.05     per diluted share, or     $6.5 million  , for the     three months ended September 30, 2015  .  FFO, as noted below, increased due to the continued growth in our operations, however, net income was adversely affected by the payment of debt extinguishment costs and interest related to debt.  For th  e     nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net income attributable to common stockholders was   $0.21   per diluted share, or   $29.4 million  , compared to   $0.18   per diluted share, or   $22.6 million  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
                  
    For additional information on FFO and Normalized FFO, see  FFO and Normalized FFO  below, which includes a reconciliation to net income attributable to common stockholders/unitholders and an explanation of why we present this non-GAAP financial measure.

For additional information on NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI, see  NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI  below, which includes a reconciliation from net income and an explanation of why we present these non-GAAP financial measures.  
     Internal Growth through Proactive Asset Management Leasing and Property Management 
             
    As of   September 30, 2016  , our leased rate (includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced) was   91.8%   by GLA and our occupancy rate was   91.3%   by GLA.  
                 
    Tenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio was   67%   and   79%  , which included approximately   309,000   and   932,000   square feet of expiring leases, for the quarter and year to date, respectively, which we believe is indicative of our commitment to maintaining buildings in desirable locations and fostering strong tenant relationships.  Tenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio, excluding the impact of the Forest Park Medical Center hospital leases, was   84%   by GLA for the quarter and year to date.  Tenant retention is defined as the sum of the total leased GLA of tenants that renewed a lease during the period over the total GLA of leases that renewed or expired during the period.  
                
    As of   September 30, 2016  , our in-house property management and leasing platform operated approximately   16.0 million   square feet of GLA, or   91%   of our total portfolio.  
     Key Market Focused Strategy and Investments 
  We believe we have been one of the most active investors in the medical office sector over the last ten years and have developed a strong presence across 20 to 25 key markets.  In each of these markets we have established a strong asset management and leasing platform that has allowed us to develop valuable relationships with health systems, physician practices, universities, and regional development firms that have led to investment and leasing opportunities.  Our local platforms have also enabled us to focus on generating cost efficiencies as we gain scale across individual markets and regions.  
              
    Our key markets represent top MSAs with strong growth metrics in jobs and population, low unemployment and mature healthcare infrastructures.  
                
    Our investment strategy includes the alignment with key healthcare systems, hospitals and leading academic medical universities.  
                
    Over the last several years, our investments have been focused in our key markets, with the majority of our investments also being located either on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems.  
                
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we acquired investments totaling   $633.0 million   located in our key markets of Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Hartford, Connecticut; and Tampa, Florida, and strategically expanded our presence into three new markets of Birmingham, Alabama; Orange County/Los Angeles, California; and Portland, Oregon  .    
                
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we completed the disposition of four senior care facilities located in Texas for an aggregate gross sales price of   $26.5 million  , generating a   gain of     $4.2 million  .

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued   $492.5 million   of equity comprised of   $297.8 million   from the sale of common stock in an underwritten public offering at an average price of   $30.64   per share,   $122.9 million   from the sale of common stock under the ATM at an average price of   $27.82   per share, and   $71.8 million   from the issuance of OP Units in connection with acquisition transactions. 
       Critical Accounting Policies 
  The complete list of our critical accounting policies was disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed herein.  
  Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  See   Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements.  
  Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations 
  We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally and the risk factors previously listed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the investment, management and operation of our properties. 
  Rental Income 
  The amount of rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space that will become available from unscheduled lease terminations at the then applicable rental rates.  Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods. 
  Investment Activity  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had investments with an aggregate purchase price of   $633.0 million   and a disposition with a gross sales price of   $26.5 million  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we had investments with an aggregate purchase price of   $254.6 million   and dispositions with an aggregate gross sales price of   $35.7 million  .  The amount of any future acquisitions or dispositions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.  
  Results of Operations  
  Comparison of the   Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned and operated approximately   17.6 million   square feet of GLA, with a   91.8%   leased rate (includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced) and a   91.3%   occupancy rate.  As of   September 30, 2015  , we owned and operated approximately   15.3 million   square feet of GLA, with a   92.0%   leased rate (includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced) and a   91.2%   occupancy rate.  All explanations are applicable to both HTA and   HTALP   unless otherwise noted.   
  Rental Income 
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , rental income was comprised of the following (in thousands):

Table of Contents  

Contractual rental income, which includes expense reimbursements,   increased     $13.8 million   and   $36.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  These increases were primarily due to   $15.3 million   and   $39.5 million   of additional contractual rental income from our   2015   and   2016   acquisitions (including properties owned in both periods) and contractual rent increases, partially offset by a decrease in contractual rent as a result of buildings we sold during   2015   and   2016   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.   
  Average starting and ending annual base rents and square feet entered into for new and renewal leases consist of the following for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in square feet and per square foot of GLA): 

Tenant improvements, leasing commissions and tenant concessions per square foot of GLA for new and renewal leases consist of the following for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in per square foot of GLA): 

The average term for new and renewal leases executed consist of the following for   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in years):   

  Rental Expenses  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , rental expenses attributable to our properties were   $36.9 million   and   $32.9 million  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , rental expenses attributable to our properties were   $105.3 million   and   $92.9 million  , respectively.  These   increases   in rental expenses were primarily due to   $5.9 million   and   $18.0 million   of additional rental expenses associated with our   2015   and   2016   acquisitions for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies and a decrease in rental expenses as a result of the buildings we sold during   2015   and   2016  .  
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , general and administrative expenses were   $7.3 million   and   $6.4 million  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , general and administrative expenses were   $20.9 million   and   $19.2 million  , respectively.  These increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily due to the increase in non-cash compensation expense.  General and administrative expenses include such costs as salaries, corporate overhead and professional fees, among other items.  
  Acquisition-Related Expenses 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , acquisition-related expenses were   $1.1 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , acquisition-related expenses were   $5.0 million   and   $3.4 million  , respectively.  These increases in acquisition-related expenses were primarily due to increased acquisition activity during   2016  .

Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation and amortization expense was   $47.9 million   and   $40.5 million  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , depreciation and amortization expense was   $130.4 million   and   $115.2 million  , respectively.  These increases in depreciation and amortization expense were primarily due to the   increase   in the size of our portfolio.   
  Interest Expense and Net Change in Fair Value of Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Interest expense excluding the impact of the net change in fair value of derivative financial instruments increased by   $2.5 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  This increase was primarily the result of higher average debt outstanding during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as a result of partially funding our investments over the last 12 months with debt and a change in the composition of debt, driven by an increase in long-term senior unsecured notes, including the $350.0 million 10-year senior unsecured notes issued in July 2016 at a coupon rate of 3.50%, offset by a reduction in the aggregate variable unsecured revolving credit facility borrowings and mortgage loans outstanding.  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the fair market value of our derivatives increased   $1.3 million  , compared to a net decrease of   $2.4 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Interest expense excluding the impact of the net change in fair value of derivative financial instruments increased by   $2.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This increase was primarily the result of higher average debt outstanding during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as a result of partially funding our investments over the last 12 months with debt and a change in the composition of debt, driven by an increase in long-term senior unsecured notes, including the $350.0 million 10-year senior unsecured notes issued in July 2016 at a coupon rate of 3.50%, offset by a reduction in the aggregate variable unsecured revolving credit facility borrowings and mortgage loans outstanding.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the fair market value of our derivatives decreased   $2.1 million  , compared to a net decrease of   $3.1 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  To achieve our objectives, we borrow at both fixed and variable rates.  We also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument.  We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. 
  Gain on Sales of Real Estate 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we realized a gain of   $4.2 million   on the disposition of four senior care facilities.  We did not have any dispositions during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we realized a gain of   $0.2 million   from the disposition of six MOBs.  
  NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI  
  NOI   increased     $10.4 million   to   $81.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  NOI   increased     $24.7 million   to   $233.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  These increases were primarily due to   $10.8 million   and   $25.6 million     of additional NOI from our   2015   and   2016   acquisitions for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, partially offset by a decrease in NOI as a result of the buildings we sold during   2015   and   2016   and a reduction in straight-line rent from properties we owned more than a year.  
  Same-Property Cash NOI   increased     $2.2 million   to   $68.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Same-Property Cash NOI   increased     $5.6 million   to   $192.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  These increases were primarily the result of rent escalations, an increase in average occupancy and improved operating efficiencies.  
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  FFO and Normalized FFO 
  We compute FFO in accordance with the current standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ).  NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property and impairment write-downs of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization related to investments in real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We present this non-GAAP financial measure because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs.  Historical cost accounting assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen based on market conditions, many industry investors have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.  Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, among other items, it provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/ 
  
   30 

Table of Contents  

unitholders.  
  We also compute Normalized FFO, which excludes from FFO: (i) acquisition-related expenses; (ii) gain or loss on change in fair value of derivative financial instruments; (iii) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (iv) noncontrolling income or loss from partnership units included in diluted shares (only applicable to HTA); and (v) other normalizing items, which include items that are unusual and infrequent in nature.  We present this non-GAAP financial measure because it allows for the comparison of our operating performance to other REITs and between periods on a consistent basis.  Our methodology for calculating Normalized FFO may be different from the methods utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to other REITs.  Normalized FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance, nor is it indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.  Normalized FFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.  
  The amounts included in the calculation of FFO and Normalized FFO are generally the same for   HTALP   and HTA, except for net income or loss attributable to common stockholders/unitholders, noncontrolling income or loss from partnership units included in diluted shares (only applicable to HTA) and the weighted average shares of HTA common stock or   HTALP   partnership units outstanding.  
  The following is the reconciliation of HTA s FFO and Normalized FFO to net income attributable to common stockholders for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except per share data):

NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI  
  NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) before: (i) general and administrative expenses; (ii) acquisition-related expenses; (iii) depreciation and amortization expense; (iv) impairment; (v) interest expense and net change in fair value of derivative financial instruments; (vi) gain or loss on sales of real estate; (vii) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; and (viii) other income or expense.  We believe that NOI provides an accurate measure of the operating performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the management of our properties.  Additionally, we believe that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance of REITs.  However, our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount.  NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance.  NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.  
  Cash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes from NO  I: (i) straight-line rent adjustments and (ii) amortization of below and above market leases/leasehold interests and lease termination fees.  Contractual base rent, contractual rent increases, contractual rent concessions and changes in occupancy or lease rates upon commencement and expiration of leases are a primary driver of our revenue performance.  We believe that Cash NOI, which removes the impact of straight-line rent adjustments, provides another measurement of the operating performance of our operating assets.  Additionally, we believe that Cash NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance of REITs.  However, our use of the term Cash NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs as they may have different methodologies for computing   this amount.  Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance.  Cash NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements. 
  To facilitate the comparison of Cash NOI between periods, we calculate comparable amounts for a subset of our owned properties referred to as  Same-Property .  Same-Property Cash NOI excludes properties which have not been owned and operated by us during the entire span of all periods presented, excluding properties intended for disposition in the near term, notes receivable interest income and certain non-routine items.  Same-Property Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance.  Same-Property Cash NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.

  Our primary sources of cash include: (i) cash flow from operations; (ii) borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility; (iii) net proceeds from the issuances of debt and equity securities; and (iv) proceeds from our dispositions.  During the next 12 months our primary uses of cash are expected to include: (i) the funding of acquisitions of MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry; (ii) capital expenditures; (iii) the payment of operating expenses; (iv) debt service payments, including principal payments; and (v) the payment of dividends to our stockholders.  We anticipate cash flow from operations, restricted cash and reserve accounts and our unsecured revolving credit facility, if needed, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and dividends to stockholders.  Investments and maturing indebtedness may require funds from the issuance of debt and/or equity securities or proceeds from sales of real estate.        
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had liquidity of   $835.4 million  , including   $817.5 million   available under our unsecured revolving credit facility (includes the impact of   $5.5 million   of outstanding letters of credit) and   $17.9 million   of cash and cash equivalents.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $177.1 million   was available for issuance under our $300.0 million ATM program.  In addition, we had unencumbered properties with a gross book value of   $3.6 billion  .  The unencumbered properties may be used as collateral to secure additional financings in future periods or to refinance our current debt as it becomes due.  Our ability to raise funds from future debt and equity issuances is dependent on our investment grade credit ratings, general economic and market conditions and our operating performance.  
  When we acquire a property, we prepare a capital plan that contemplates the estimated capital needs of that investment.  In addition to operating expenses, capital needs may also include costs of refurbishment, tenant improvements or other major capital expenditures.  The capital plan for each investment will be adjusted through ongoing, regular reviews of our portfolio or as necessary to respond to unanticipated additional capital needs.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimate that our expenditures for capital improvements for the remainder of 2016 will range from   $5.0 million   to   $10.0 million   depending on leasing activity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $7.4 million   of restricted cash and reserve accounts for such capital expenditures.  We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will not exceed these estimated expenditure levels.

If we experience lower occupancy levels, reduced rental rates, reduced revenues as a result of asset sales, or increased capital expenditures and leasing costs compared to historical levels due to competitive market conditions for new and renewal leases, the effect would be a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities.  If such a reduction of net cash provided by operating activities is realized, we may have a cash flow deficit in subsequent periods.  Our estimate of net cash available is based on various assumptions which are difficult to predict, including the levels of our leasing activity and related leasing costs.  Any changes in these assumptions could impact our financial results and our ability to fund working capital and unanticipated cash needs. 
  Cash Flows  
  The following is a summary of our cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):  

Net cash provided by operating activities increased in   2016   primarily due to the impact of our 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, contractual rent   increases     and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by our   2015   and 2016 dispositions.  We anticipate cash flows from operating activities to   increase     as a result of the above items and continued leasing activity in our existing portfolio.   
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash used in investing activities primarily related to the investment in real estate of   $532.5 million   and capital expenditures of   $34.1 million  , partially offset by proceeds from the sale of real estate of   $23.4 million  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , net cash used in investing activities primarily related to the investment in real estate of   $253.1 million   and capital expenditures of   $17.3 million  , partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of real estate of   $33.3 million  .  We anticipate cash flows used in investing activities to increase as we continue to acquire more properties. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by financing activities primarily related to the net proceeds of shares of common stock issued of   $418.9 million   and proceeds from unsecured senior notes of   $347.7 million  , partially offset by net payments on our unsecured revolving credit facility of   $191.0 million  , dividends paid to holders of our common stock of   $116.7 million   and payments on our secured mortgage loans of   $98.5 million  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , net cash provided by financing activities primarily related to net borrowings of   $240.0 million   on our Unsecured Credit Agreement and the net proceeds of shares of common stock issued of   $44.3 million  , partially offset by dividends paid to holders of our common stock of   $108.9 million   and payments on our mortgage and term loans of   $76.1 million  .  
  Dividends 
  The amount of dividends HTA pays to its stockholders is determined by its Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual dividend distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  HTA has paid monthly or quarterly dividends since February   2007  , and if our investments produce sufficient cash flow, we expect to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders.  Because our cash available for dividend distributions in any year may be less than   90%   of our taxable income for the year, we may obtain the necessary funds through borrowings, issuing new securities or selling assets to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy our dividend distribution requirement.  HTA s organizational documents do not establish a limit on dividends that may constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes.  The dividend HTA pays to its stockholders is equal to the distributions received from   HTALP   in accordance with the terms of   HTALP   s partnership agreement.  It is HTA s intention to continue to pay dividends.  However, HTA s Board of Directors may reduce our dividend rate and HTA cannot guarantee the timing and amount of dividends that it may pay in the future, if any. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , HTA paid cash dividends of   $116.7 million  .  In October 2016, HTA paid cash dividends of   $42.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  On   October 25, 2016  , HTA declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.30   per share to be paid on   January 10, 2017   to stockholders of record of its common stock on   January 3, 2017  .

Financing 
  We have historically maintained a low leveraged balance sheet and intend to continue to maintain this structure over the long run.  However, our total leverage may fluctuate on a short term basis as we execute our business strategy.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our leverage ratio of debt to capitalization was   26.4%  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had debt outstanding of   $1.7 billion   and the weighted average interest rate was   3.35%   per annum, inclusive of the impact of our interest rate swaps.  The following is a summary of our unsecured and secured debt.  See   Note 7 - Debt   to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our debt. 
  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $817.5 million   was available on our unsecured revolving credit facility.  Our unsecured revolving credit facility matures in   January 2020  .  In February 2015, we executed an amendment to the Unsecured Credit Agreement which added an additional lender and increased the amount available under the unsecured revolving credit facility by   $50.0 million   to   $850.0 million  .  The other existing terms of the Unsecured Credit Agreement were unchanged.  
  Unsecured Term Loans 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $500.0 million   of unsecured term loans outstanding, comprised of a   $300.0 million   term loan under our Unsecured Credit Agreement maturing in 2019 and a   $200.0 million   unsecured term loan maturing in 2023.  The   $300.0 million   term loan includes a one-year extension exercisable at the option of the borrower, subject to certain conditions.   
  Unsecured Senior Notes 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $  950.0 million   of unsecured senior notes outstanding, comprised of   $300.0 million   of unsecured senior notes maturing in   2021  ,   $300.0 million   of unsecured senior notes maturing in   2023  , and   $350.0 million   of unsecured senior notes maturing in   2026  .   
  Mortgage Loans 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we made payments of   $98.5 million   on our mortgage loans and have   $1.4 million   of principal payments due on current outstanding indebtedness during the remainder of 2016.  
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  There have been no material changes from the commitments and contingencies disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  Debt Service Requirements 
  We are required by the terms of our applicable loan agreements to meet certain financial covenants, such as minimum net worth and liquidity, and reporting requirements, among others.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe that we were in compliance with all such covenants and we are not aware of any covenants that we are reasonably likely not to satisfy. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of and during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
  Inflation 
  We are exposed to inflation risk as income from future long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations.  There are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that protect us from the impact of normal inflation.  These provisions include rent escalations, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges and real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot allowance.  However, due to the long-term nature of our leases, among other factors, the leases may not reset frequently enough to cover inflation.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
  There were no material changes in the information regarding market risk that was provided in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The table below presents, as of   September 30, 2016  , the principal amounts of our fixed and variable debt and the weighted average interest rates, excluding the impact of interest rate swaps, by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes (in thousands, except interest rates):  

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.7 billion   fixed and variable rate debt with interest rates ranging from   1.55%   to   6.26%   per annum and a weighted average interest rate of   3.22%   per annum, excluding the impact of interest rate swaps.  We had   $1,159.8 million   (excluding net premium/discount and deferred financing costs) of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of   3.89%   per annum and   $566.1 million   (excluding net premium/discount and deferred financing costs) of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of   1.86%   per annum as of   September 30, 2016  , excluding the impact of interest rate swaps.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our fixed rate debt was   $1,204.7 million   and the fair value of our variable rate debt was   $576.9 million   based upon prevailing market rates as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had interest rate swaps outstanding that effectively fix   $191.0 million   of our variable rate debt.  Including the impact of these interest rate swaps, the effective rate on our variable rate and total debt is   2.25%   and   3.35%   per annum, respectively.   
  In addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our future properties is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Healthcare Trust of America, Inc.  
  HTA s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to HTA s management, including HTA s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was conducted by HTA under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including HTA s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
