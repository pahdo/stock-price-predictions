NOTE 1 - CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at September 30, 2016 and for all periods presented herein, have been made.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's December 31, 2015 audited financial statements.  The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years.

NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has evaluated recent accounting pronouncements and their adoption has not had or is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, or statements.

Costs in Excess of Billings 

Costs in excess of billings represent unbilled amounts earned and reimbursable under contracts. These amounts become billable according to the contract terms, which usually consider the passage of time, achievement of milestones or completion of the project. Generally, such unbilled amounts will be billed and collected over the next twelve months. Based on our historical experience, we generally consider the collection risk related to these amounts to be low. When events or conditions indicate that the amounts outstanding may become uncollectible, an allowance is estimated and recorded.

NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Inventory 

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market.  The Company's inventory consists of finished goods and raw material and is located in Vista, California, consisting of the following:

The Company has established an allowance for obsolete inventory.  Expense for obsolete inventory was $-0- and $-0-, for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

Property and Equipment 

Property and equipment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:

Depreciation expense for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $20 ,800  and $22,173, respectively.

Basic and Diluted Loss per Share 

The computation of basic earnings per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods presented. The computation of fully diluted earnings per share includes common stock equivalents outstanding at the balance sheet date. The Company had -0- and -0- stock options and warrants that would have been included in the fully diluted earnings per share as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes ("Topic 740"), which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets at currently enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Topic 740 provides guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's financial statements. Topic 740 requires a company to determine whether it is more

likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements.

At the adoption date of November 1, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefit which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operations in the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company files an income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the state of California. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2008.

NOTE 3   COSTS IN EXCESS OF BILLINGS

Costs in excess of billings at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:

NOTE 5 -  STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS (CONTINUED)

In April 2007, the Company's shareholders approved its 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("the 2006 Plan").   Under the 2006 plan, the Company may issue up to 10,000,000 shares of both Incentive Stock Options to employees only and Non-Qualified Stock Options to employees and consultants at its discretion.  As of December 31, 2014 the remaining 2,590,000 options previously issued under the plan expired. On August 3, 2011 the Board of Directors adopted the Omnitek Engineering Corp. 2011 Long-term Incentive Plan (the "2011 Plan"), under which 1,000,000 shares of Company's Common Stock were reserved for issuance of both Incentive Stock Options to employees only and and Non-Qualified Stock Options to employees and consultants at its discretion. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has a total of 915,000 options issued under the plan. On September 11, 2015 the Board of Directors adopted the Omnitek Engineering Corp. 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan"), under which 2,500,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock were reserved for issuance of both Incentive Stock Options to employees only and Non-Qualified Stock Options to employees and consultants at its discretion. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has a total of 820,000 options issued under the plan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company issued -0- and -0- warrants, respectively.

The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on their grant date fair value.  The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires management to make estimates for certain assumptions regarding risk-free interest rate, expected life of options, expected volatility of stock and expected dividend yield of stock. When determining expected volatility, the Company considers the historical performance of the Company's stock, as well as implied volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options' expected term. The expected term of the options is based on the Company's evaluation of option holders' exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options are expected to remain unexercised. The Company uses historical data to estimate the timing and amount of forfeitures.

The following table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted:

Results of Operations 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Revenues were $355,050 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $438,178 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $83,128. The results for the period reflect the impact of the timing of shipments.

Cost of sales was $200,894 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $245,419 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $44,525. Our gross margin was 43% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 44% in the same period in 2015.

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $370,554 compared with $464,697 in the same period in 2015, a decrease of $94,143 or 20%. General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $306,535 compared with $385,209 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to options expense of $30,887 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $89,806 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Major components of general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were professional fees of $13,129, rent expense of $23,568, and salary and wages of $140,226. This compares to professional fees of $13,221, rent expense of $42,068 and salaries and wages of $122,106 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   For the three months ended September 30, 2016  research and development outlays were decreased to $57,402 compared with $71,963 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in outlays between the two periods was primarily due to a reduction in active research and development projects.

Page 12

Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $217,909, or $0.01 per share, compared with a net loss of $271,972, or $0.01 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Additionally, operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $216,398 compared with $271,938 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decreased operating loss was primarily due to lower options expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period a year earlier.

Results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflect the impact of non-cash expenses, including the value of options and warrants granted in the amount of $30,887 and depreciation and amortization of $6,617.  For the three month period a year earlier non-cash expenses included options and warrants granted in the amount of $89,806 and depreciation and amortization of $7,526.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Revenues decreased to $946,948 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,480,063 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $533,115 or 36 %. The results for the period reflect the impact of the timing of shipments.

Cost of sales decreased to $521,387 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $766,067 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $244,680. Our gross margin was 45% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 48% in 2015 . The reduction in gross margin was the result of the change in product mix between the two periods.

Our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,133,576 compared with $1,394,353 in 2015, a decrease of $260,777 or 19%.  General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $960,789 compared with $1,133,102 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease was due primarily to options expense of $148,955 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $176,895 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and travel expense of $12,002 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $39,919 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Major components of general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were professional fees of $65,107, rent expense of $71,639 and salary and wages of $381,588. This compares to professional fees of $73,008, rent expense of $117,051, and salary and wages of $387,592 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development outlays were decreased to $151,706 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $238,201 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $707,592, or $0.04 per share, compared with a net loss of $677,414, or $0.03 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Additionally, operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $708,015 compared with $680,357 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increased operating loss was primarily due  to non-cash expenses and decreased revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period a year earlier. 

Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflect the impact of non-cash expenses, including the value of options and warrants granted in the amount of $148,955 and depreciation and amortization of  $21,081.  For the nine-month period a year earlier, non-cash expenses for the value of options and warrants granted were $176,895, depreciation and amortization of $23,050. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and available working capital. Additionally, from time to time we may raise funds from the equity capital markets to fund our research and development programs, expansion of our business and general operations.

Page 13

At September 30, 2016, our current liabilities totaled $684,127 and our current assets totaled $2,095,737, resulting in positive working capital of $1,411,610 and a current ratio of 3.06.

We have no firm commitments or obligations for capital expenditures.  However, substantial discretionary expenditures may be required to enable us to conduct existing and planned product research, design, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our products. We may need to raise additional capital to facilitate growth and support our long-term product development, manufacturing, and marketing programs. The Company has no established bank-financing arrangements. Therefore, it is possible that we need to seek additional financing through subsequent future public or private sales of our securities, including equity securities. We may also seek funding for the development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products through strategic partnerships and other arrangements with corporate partners. There can be no assurance, however, that such collaborative arrangements or additional funds will be available when needed, or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail one or more of our research and development programs.

We have historically incurred significant losses, which have resulted in a total accumulated deficit of $18,557,004 at September 30, 2016, of which $5,604,135 is  a direct result of derivative expense and change in fair value of derivative liability and is unrelated to our operations or cash flow. 

Operating Activities

We realized a negative cash flow from operations of $199,041 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with a negative cash flow of $293,071 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Included in the operating loss of $707,592 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are non-cash expenses, which are not a drain on our capital resources.  During the period, these non-cash expenses include the value of options and warrants granted in the amount of $148,955 and depreciation and amortization of $21,081.  Excluding these non-cash amounts, our adjusted operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is $537,556.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

None.

Critical Accounting Policies         and Estimates  

Accounting Method and Use of Estimates

The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas where significant estimates are required include the following:

Accounts Receivable

Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts.

Inventory

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company's inventory consists of finished goods and raw material. The Company identifies items in its inventory that have not been sold in a timely manner. Accordingly, the Company has established an allowance for the cost of such obsolete inventory.

Long-lived assets

The Company assesses the recoverability of its long lived assets annually and whenever circumstances would indicate that there may be an impairment. The Company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the long lived assets to determine if an impairment has occurred. In the event that an impairment has occurred, the Company recognizes the impairment immediately.

Costs in excess of billings

Costs in excess of billings represent unbilled amounts earned and reimbursable under contracts. These amounts become billable according to the contract terms, which usually consider the passage of time, achievement of milestones or completion of the project. Generally, such unbilled amounts will be billed and collected over the next twelve months. Based on our historical experience, we generally consider the collection risk related to these amounts to be low. When events or conditions indicate that the amounts outstanding may become uncollectible, an allowance is estimated and recorded.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets at currently enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company uses historical experience to determine the likelihood of realization of deferred tax liabilities and assets.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of new natural gas engines and components to convert existing diesel engines to natural gas engines. Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, and when collection is reasonably assured.

Accounting for Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes ("Topic 740"), which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets at currently enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is recognized to reduce the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Topic 740 provides guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's financial statements. Topic 740 requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements.

At the adoption date of November 1, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefit which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.

The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operations in the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

The Company files an income tax return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the state of California. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2008.

At September 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  $6,300,000   through 2034.   No tax benefit has been reported in the September 30, 2016 financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.

Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has evaluated recent accounting pronouncements and their adoption has not had or is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, or statements.
