  1. Organization and Basis of Presentation   
  Organization:  TCW Direct Lending LLC ( Company ), was formed as a Delaware corporation on March 20, 2014 and converted
to a Delaware limited liability company on April 1, 2014. The Company conducted a private offering of its limited liability company units (the  Common Units ) to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements
of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). In addition, the Company may issue preferred units, though it currently has no intention to do so. The Company has engaged TCW Asset Management Company LLC
( TAMCO ), an affiliate of The TCW Group, Inc. ( TCW ) to be its adviser (the  Adviser ). On May 13, 2014 ( Inception Date ), the Company sold and issued 10 Common Units at an aggregate purchase price of
$1 to TAMCO.    The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). The Company has also elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a Regulated Investment Company (a  RIC ) under Subchapter M of the U.S Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the  Code ) for the taxable year ending December 31, 2015 and subsequent years. The Company is required to meet the minimum distribution and other requirements for RIC qualification and as a BDC and a RIC, the Company is
required to comply with certain regulatory requirements.    On September 19, 2016, the Company formed TCW Direct Lending Luxembourg VI
S. .r.l., ( TCW Direct Lending Luxembourg ) a private limited liability company under the laws of Luxembourg, of which the Company owns 100% of the membership interests. The Company incurred $136 in professional fees in connection
with the formation of TCW Direct Lending Luxembourg, all of which were expensed as incurred. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and TCW Direct Lending Luxembourg. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.     Term:  The term of the Company will continue until the sixth anniversary of the
Initial Closing Date (as defined below), September 14, 2020 unless extended or sooner dissolved as provided in the limited liability agreement or by operation of law. The Company may extend the term for two additional one-year periods upon
written notice to the holders of the Common Units and holders of preferred units, if any, (collectively the  Members ) at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the term or the end of the first one-year period. Thereafter, the term may
be extended for successive one-year periods, with the vote or consent of a supermajority in interest of the holders of the Common Units.  
  Commitment Period:  The Commitment Period commenced on September 19, 2014 (the  Initial Closing Date ) and will end on
the third anniversary of the Initial Closing Date.     Capital Commitments:  On September 19, 2014 (the  Initial Closing
Date ), the Company began accepting subscription agreements from investors for the private sale of its Common Units. On March 19, 2015, the Company completed its final private placement of its Common Units. Subscription agreements with
commitments ( Commitments ) from investors (each a  Common Unitholder ) totaling $2,013,470 for the purchase of Common Units were accepted. Each Common Unitholder is obligated to contribute capital equal to their Commitment and
each Unit s Commitment obligation is $100.00 per unit. The amount of capital that remains to be drawn down and contributed is referred to as an  Undrawn Commitment.   
 The commitment amount funded does not include amounts contributed in anticipation of a potential investment that the Company did not
consummate and therefore returned to the Members  as unused capital. As of September 30, 2016 aggregate Commitments, Undrawn Commitments and subscribed for Units of the Company were as follows:  
   
    Recallable Amount:  A Common Unitholder may be required to re-contribute amounts distributed equal to
75% of the principal amount or the cost portion of any Portfolio Investment that is fully repaid to or otherwise fully recouped by the Company within one year of the Company s investment. The Recallable Amount is excluded from the calculation
of the accrual based net asset value.    The Recallable Amount as of September 30, 2016 was $63,750.

   1. Organization and Basis of Presentation (continued)   
   
   Investments Transferred In-Kind:  In partial satisfaction of its capital commitment to
TCW Direct Lending Strategic Ventures LLC ( Strategic Ventures ), the Company transferred in-kind 100% of its investment interest in two loans with an aggregate fair market value of $111,656 to Strategic Ventures on June 3, 2015.
Investments transferred include Motor Coach Industries International, Inc. term loan A and term loan B, outstanding par amount, on a combined basis of $66,656 and Angie s List , Inc. term loan, outstanding par amount of $45,000 and an unfunded
delayed draw of $18,750.    The amount realized on the investment and corresponding in-kind transfer of $111,656 recognized by the Company
equaled the fair value of such investments on the date of transfer.     2. Significant Accounting Policies   
  Basis of Presentation:  The consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). The Company is an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) Topic 946,  Financial Services Investment Companies  ( ASC Topic 946 ). The Company has consolidated the results of its wholly owned subsidiary in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC
Topic 946.    The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of
management, necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not indicative of results to be expected for the full year.  
 Amounts as of December 31, 2015 included in the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited financial
statements as of that date. Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements, including certain financial statement footnotes, prepared in accordance with GAAP, is not required for interim reporting purposes and
has been condensed or omitted herein. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and notes related thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 30, 2016.  
  Reclassifications : Certain prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations relating to audit, legal, valuation and
tax service fees have been reclassified into  Professional Fees  and sub-administrator, transfer agent and custody fee expense have been reclassified into  Administrative Fees.  On the Consolidated Statements of Assets and
Liabilities certain prior period amounts in sub-administrator, transfer agent and custody fees, insurance, audit and tax service and valuations service fee payables have been reclassified into  Other accrued expenses and liabilities. 
These reclassifications have been made to conform to the current period presentation.     Use of Estimates:  The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, (ii) the reported
amounts of income and expenses during the years presented and (iii) disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  Investments : The Company measures the value of its investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosure  ( ASC Topic 820 ). Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market participants are
defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the Company considers its
principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity.     Transactions:  The Company records investment
transactions on the trade date. The Company considers trade date for investments not traded on a recognizable exchange, or traded in the over-the-counter markets, to be the date on which the Company receives legal or contractual title to the asset
and bears the risk of loss.

   2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)   
   
   Income Recognition : Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis unless doubtful of
collection or the related investment is in default. Realized gains and losses on investments are recorded on a specific identification basis. The Company typically receives a fee in the form of a discount to the purchase price at the time it funds
an investment in a loan. The discount is accreted to interest income over the life of the respective loan using the effective-interest method assuming there are no questions as to collectability, and reflected in the amortized cost basis of the
investment. Discounts associated with a revolver are treated as a discount to the issuers  term loan. In the event there is a fee associated with a delayed draw that remains unfunded, the Company will recognize the fee as fee income
immediately. Ongoing facility, commitment or other additional fees including, prepayment fees, consent fees and forbearance fees are recognized immediately when earned as income.  
  Deferred Financing Costs:  Deferred financing costs incurred by the Company in connection with the revolving credit facility, including
arrangement fees, upfront fees and legal fees, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the revolving credit facility.  
  Organization and Offering Costs:  Costs incurred to organize the Company totaling $665 were expensed as incurred. Offering costs
totaling $853 were accumulated and charged directly to Members  Capital on March 19, 2015, the end of the period during which Common Units were offered (the  Closing Period ). The Company did not bear more than an amount equal to
10 basis points of the aggregate capital commitments of the Company for organization and offering expenses.        Cash and Cash
Equivalents:  The Company considers all investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 cash and cash equivalents is comprised of demand deposits and highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less, which approximate fair value.     Income Taxes:  So long as the Company maintains
its status as a RIC, it generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. Federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income
earned and distributed by the Company represents obligations of the Company s investors and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.  
  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted:  In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,
 Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  ( ASU 2015-02 ), which amends the consolidation requirements in ASC 810, Consolidation ,  and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under GAAP. The FASB s focus
during deliberations was largely on the investment management industry. The key amendments that had a significant impact on Company s consolidation conclusion included:      

Limited partnerships will be variable interest entities (VIEs), unless the limited partners have either
substantive kick-out or participating rights. Although more partnerships will be VIEs, it is less likely that a general partner will consolidate a limited partnership.     

The ASU changes the effect that fees paid to a decision maker or service provider have on the consolidation
analysis. Specifically, it is less likely that the fees themselves will be considered a variable interest, that an entity will be a VIE, or that consolidation will result.     

The deferral of ASU 2009-17,  Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable
Interest Entities,  for investments in certain investment funds has been eliminated. Therefore, investment managers, general partners, and investors in these investment funds will need to perform a drastically different consolidation evaluation.

For entities other than limited partnerships, ASU 2015-02 clarified how to determine whether the equity
holders (as a group) have power over the entity (this will most likely result in a change to current practice). The clarification could affect whether the entity is a VIE.     
 ASU 2015-02 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 had no material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.

   2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)   
   
    The Company adopted ASU 2015-03,    Interest   Imputation of Interest
(Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.    The Company also adopted ASU 2015-15,    Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  
Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015   . Together, these ASUs required, in most cases, that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of
the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements, however, may continue to be presented as an asset in the balance sheet. The adoption of
these ASUs had no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.      In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2015-07,  Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) , which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy
all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. ASU 2015-07 is effective for annual reporting periods, and the interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.
The adoption of ASU No. 2015-07 had no material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.     3. Investment
Valuations and Fair Value Measurements       Investments at Fair Value:   Investments held by the Company are valued at fair
value. Fair value is generally determined on the basis of last reported sales prices or official closing prices on the primary exchange in which each security trades, or if no sales are reported, based on the midpoint of the valuation range obtained
for debt investments from a quotation reporting system, established market makers or pricing service.    Investments for which market quotes
are not readily available or are not considered reliable are valued at fair value and approved by the Board of Directors (the  Board ) based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing
inputs.      Fair Value Hierarchy:   Assets and liabilities are classified by the Company based on valuation inputs used to
determine fair value into three levels:    Level 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for
identical assets.    Level 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar
assets and quoted prices in inactive markets or other market observable inputs.    Level 3 values are based on significant
unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s determination of assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets.  
 Categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation
levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.     Level 1 Assets (Investments): 
The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows:     Registered Investment
Companies, (Level 1),  include registered open-end investment companies that are valued based upon the reported net asset value of such investment.  
  Level 3 Assets (Investments):  The following valuation techniques and significant inputs are used to determine fair value of investments
in private debt and equity for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal assumptions applied are unobservable.  
  Debt, (Level 3) , include investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such securities are valued based on
specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A discounted cash flow approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital is generally used to determine fair value. Valuation may also
include a shadow rating method. Standard pricing inputs include but are not limited to the financial health of the issuer, place in the capital structure, value of other issuer debt, credit, industry, and market risk and events.

   Equity, (Level 3) , include common stock. Such securities are valued
based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A market approach is generally used to determine fair value. Pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, financial health, and
relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA, market multiples of comparable companies, comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market events; contractual or legal restrictions on the sale of
the security. A liquidity discount based on current market expectations, future events, minority ownership position and the period management reasonably expects to hold the investment may be applied.  
 Pricing inputs and weightings applied to determine value require subjective determination. Accordingly, valuations do not
necessarily represent the amounts that may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments.     Net Asset Value
( NAV ) (Investment Funds and Vehicles) : Equity investments in affiliated investment fund (Strategic Ventures) are valued based on the NAV reported by the investment fund. Investments held by the affiliated fund include debt
investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such investments held by the affiliated fund are valued using the same methods, approach and standards applied above to debt investments held by the Company. The Company s ability to
withdraw from the fund is subject to restrictions. The term of the fund will continue until June 5, 2021 unless dissolved earlier or extended for two additional one-year periods by the Company, in its full discretion. The Company can further
extend the term of the fund for additional one-year periods, upon notice to and consent from the funds management committee. The Company is entitled to income and principal distributed by the fund.

    Valuation Process:   
 Oversight for determining fair value is the responsibility of the Board of the Company (with input from the Adviser and an external,
independent valuation firm retained by the Company). The Company and the Adviser value the investments at fair value on a quarterly basis and whenever required by the Company s operating agreement. The Company has engaged an external,
independent valuation firm to assist the Board in determining the fair market value of the Company s investments for which market quotations are not readily available.  
 The Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process for investments whose market prices are not otherwise readily available. Unless noted,
the Company is utilizing the midpoint of a valuation range provided by an external, independent valuation firm and approved by the Board. The Board may approve a value other than the midpoint if it believes that is the fair value.

   3. Investment Valuations and Fair Value Measurements (continued)   

Based on its review of the external, independent valuation firm s range and related documentation, the Adviser documents the valuation recommendations. The Adviser provides the
valuation recommendation for each investment to the Company s audit committee, based on / along with the independent valuation report. After the Company s audit committee reviews the valuation recommendations, the Board discusses the
portfolio company and investment valuations with the Adviser and determines the fair value of these investments in good faith.    The
Adviser uses all relevant factors in recommending fair value including, without limitation, any of the following factors as may be deemed relevant by the Board: current financial position and current and historical operating results of the issuer;
sales prices of recent public or private transactions in the same or similar securities, including transactions on any securities exchange on which such securities are listed or in the over-the-counter market; general level of interest rates; recent
trading volume of the security; restrictions on transfer including the Company s right, if any, to require registration of its securities by the issuer under the securities laws; any liquidation preference or other special feature or term of
the security; significant recent events affecting the portfolio company, including any pending private placement, public offering, merger, or acquisition; the price paid by the Company to acquire the asset; the percentage of the issuer s
outstanding securities that is owned by the Company and all other factors affecting value.     4. Agreements and Related Party Transactions   
  Advisory Agreement:  On September 15, 2014, the Company entered into an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement (the
 Advisory Agreement ) with the Adviser, its registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Advisory Agreement was approved by the Board at an in-person meeting. Unless earlier terminated, the
Advisory Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years and will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by (i) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and
(ii) the vote of a majority of the independent directors of the Board.       Management Fee : Pursuant to the Advisory
Agreement, and subject to the overall supervision of the Board, the Adviser will manage the Company s day-to-day operations and provide investment advisory services to the Company. The Company will pay to the Adviser, quarterly in advance, a
management fee (the  Management Fee ) calculated as follows: (i) for the period starting on the initial closing date and ending on the earlier of (A) the last day of the calendar quarter during which the Commitment Period (as
defined below) ends or (B) the last day of the calendar quarter during which the Adviser or an affiliate thereof begins to accrue a management fee with respect to a successor fund, 0.375% (i.e., 1.50% per annum) of the aggregate
commitments determined as of the end of the Closing Period, and (ii) for each calendar quarter thereafter during the term of the Company (but not beyond the tenth anniversary of the initial closing date), 0.1875% (i.e., 0.75% per annum) of
the aggregate cost basis (whether acquired by the Company with contributions from members, other Company funds or borrowings) of all portfolio investments that have not been sold, distributed to the members, or written off for tax purposes (but
reduced by any portion of such cost basis that has been written down to reflect a permanent impairment of value of any portfolio investment), determined in each case as of the first day of such calendar quarter. The Management Fee in respect of the
Closing Period will be calculated as if all capital commitments of the Company were made on the initial closing date, regardless of when Common Units were actually funded. The actual payment of the Management Fee with respect to the Closing Period
will not be made prior to the first day of the first full calendar quarter following the end of the Closing Period. The  Commitment Period  of the Company will begin on the initial closing date and end on the earlier of (a) three
years from the initial closing date and (b) the date on which the undrawn Commitment of each Common Unit has been reduced to zero. While the Management Fee will accrue from the initial closing date, the Adviser intends to defer payment of such
fees to the extent that such fees cannot be paid from interest and fee income generated by our investments.    For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, Management Fees incurred amounted to $7,551 and $22,652, respectively, of which $0 remained payable at September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Management Fees incurred
amounted to $7,634 and $27,777, respectively, of which $31,270 remained payable at September 30, 2015.     Transaction and Offset
Fees:  Any (i) transaction, advisory, consulting, management, monitoring, directors  or similar fees, (ii) closing, investment banking, finders , transaction or similar fees, (iii) commitment, breakup or topping fees or
litigation proceeds and (iv) other fee or payment of services performed or to be performed with respect to an investment or proposed investment received from or with respect to Portfolio Companies or prospective Portfolio Companies in
connection with the Company s activities will be will be the property of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for administrative or other reasons, certain fees described in

clauses (i) through (iv) above (including any fees for administrative agent services provided by the Adviser or an affiliate with respect to a particular loan or portfolio of loans made
by the Company) may be paid to the Adviser or the affiliate (rather than directly to the Company), in which case the amount of such fees (net of any related expenses associated with the generation of such fees borne by the Adviser or such affiliate
that have not been and will not be reimbursed by the Portfolio Company) shall be paid to the Company or shall offset amounts (including the Management Fee) otherwise payable by the Company to the Adviser.  
 Since inception of the Company through the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Adviser was paid directly zero and $652,
respectively in such fees. In accordance with the limited liability company agreement, as of September 30, 2016 all of the $652 of such fees has been recorded as fee income. No fees were paid to the Advisor for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015.     Incentive Fee:  In addition, the Adviser will receive an incentive fee (the  Incentive Fee ) as
follows:    (a) First, no Incentive Fee will be owed until the unitholders have collectively received cumulative
distributions pursuant to this clause (a) equal to their aggregate capital contributions in respect of all Common Units;  
 (b) Second, no Incentive Fee will be owed until the unitholders have collectively received cumulative distributions equal to
a 9% internal rate of return on their aggregate capital contributions in respect of all Common Units (the  Hurdle   
 (c) Third, the Adviser will be entitled to an Incentive Fee out of 100% of additional amounts otherwise distributable to
unitholders until such time as the cumulative Incentive Fee paid to the Adviser is equal to 20% of the sum of (i) the amount by which the Hurdle exceeds the aggregate capital contributions of the unitholders in respect of all Common Units and
(ii) the amount of Incentive Fee being paid to the Adviser pursuant to this clause (c); and    (d) Thereafter, the
Adviser will be entitled to an Incentive Fee equal to 20% of additional amounts otherwise distributable to unitholders, with the remaining 80% distributed to the unitholders.  
 The Incentive Fee will be calculated on a cumulative basis and the amount of the Incentive Fee payable in connection with any distribution (or
deemed distribution) will be determined and, if applicable, paid in accordance with the foregoing formula each time amounts are to be distributed to the unitholders.  
 If the Advisory Agreement terminates early for any reason other than (i) the Adviser voluntarily terminating the agreement or
(ii) our terminating the agreement for cause (as set out in the Advisory Agreement), we will be required to pay the Adviser a final incentive fee payment (the  Final Incentive Fee Payment ). The Final Incentive Fee Payment will be
calculated as of the date the Advisory Agreement is so terminated and will equal the amount of Incentive Fee that would be payable to the Adviser if (A) all our investments were liquidated for their current value (but without taking into
account any unrealized appreciation of any portfolio investment), and any unamortized deferred portfolio investment-related fees would be deemed accelerated, (B) the proceeds from such liquidation were used to pay all our outstanding
liabilities, and (C) the remainder were distributed to unitholders and paid as Incentive Fee in accordance with the  waterfall  (i.e., clauses (a) through (d)) described above for determining the amount of the Incentive Fee. We
will make the Final Incentive Fee Payment in cash on or immediately following the date the Advisory Agreement is so terminated. The Adviser Return Obligation (defined below) will not apply in connection with a Final Incentive Fee Payment.  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, no Incentive Fees were incurred. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, no Incentive Fees were incurred.     Administration Agreement:  On September 15, 2014, the Company
entered into the Administration Agreement with the Adviser under which the Adviser (or one or more delegated service providers) will oversee the maintenance of our financial records and otherwise assist on the Company s compliance with
regulations applicable to a BDC under the 1940 Act, and a RIC under the Code, to prepare reports to our Members, monitor the payment of our expenses and the performance of other administrative or professional service providers, and generally provide
us with administrative and back office support. The Company will reimburse the Administrator for expenses incurred by it on behalf of the Company in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. Amounts paid pursuant to the
Administration Agreement are subject to the annual cap on Company Expenses (as defined below), as described more fully below.

  The Company, and indirectly the unitholders, will bear (including by reimbursing the Adviser
or Administrator) all other costs and expenses of its operations, administration and transactions, including, without limitation, organizational and offering expenses, management fees, costs of reporting required under applicable securities laws,
legal fees of the Company s counsel and accounting fees. However, the Company will not bear (a) more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of the aggregate capital commitments of the Company for organization and offering expenses in
connection with the offering of Common Units through the Closing Period and (b) more than an amount equal to 12.5 basis points of the aggregate Commitments of the Company per annum (pro-rated for partial years) for its costs and expenses other
than ordinary operating expenses ( Company Expenses ), including amounts paid to the Administrator under the Administration Agreement and reimbursement of expenses to the Adviser. All expenses that the Company will not bear will be borne
by the Adviser or its affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cap on Company Expenses does not apply to payments of the Management Fee, Incentive Fee, organizational and offering expenses (which are subject to the separate cap), amounts
payable in connection with the Company s borrowings (including interest, bank fees, legal fees and other transactional expenses related to any borrowing or borrowing facility and similar costs), costs and expenses relating to the liquidation of
the Company, taxes, or extraordinary expenses (such as litigation expenses and indemnification payments).     TCW Direct Lending Strategic
Ventures LLC:  On June 5, 2015, the Company, together with an affiliate of Security Benefit Corporation and accounts managed by Oak Hill Advisors, L.P., entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the
 Agreement ) to become members of TCW Direct Lending Strategic Ventures LLC ( Strategic Ventures ). Strategic Ventures focuses primarily on making senior secured floating rate loans to middle-market borrowers. The Agreement was
effective June 5, 2015.    The Company s capital commitment is $481,600, representing approximately 80% of the preferred and
common equity ownership of Strategic Ventures, with the third-party investors representing the remaining capital commitments and preferred and common equity ownership. A portion of the Company s capital commitment was satisfied by the
contribution of two loans to Strategic Ventures. Strategic Ventures also entered into a revolving credit facility to finance a portion of certain eligible investments on June 5, 2015. Effective August 21, 2015, the revolving credit
facility increased to $600 million from $500 million. Strategic Ventures is managed by a management committee comprised of two members, one appointed by the Company and one appointed by Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. All decisions of the management
committee require unanimous approval of its members. Neither the Company, nor the Adviser will receive management fees from this entity. Although the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of Strategic Ventures, the Company does not
believe that it has control over Strategic Ventures (other than for purposes of the Investment Company Act).    The Company s
investments in affiliated investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:

  The Company s investments in affiliated investments for the year December 31, 2015 were as follows:
     
    5. Commitments and Contingencies   
 The Company had the following unfunded commitments and unrealized gain/(loss) as of September 30, 2016 by investment:  
   
   The Company s total capital commitment to its underlying investment in Strategic Ventures is $481,600. As
of September 30, 2016, the Company s unfunded commitment to Strategic Ventures is $200,904.    From time to time, the Company may
become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of its business. As of September 30, 2016, management is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation.  
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts which provide a variety of representations and warranties, and that
provide general indemnifications. Such contracts include those with certain service providers, brokers and trading counterparties. Any exposure to the Company under these arrangements is unknown as it would involve future claims that may be made
against the Company; however, based on the Company s experience, the risk of loss is remote and no such claims are expected to occur. As such, the Company has not accrued any liability in connection with such indemnifications.  
  6. Members  Capital   
 As of the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not sell or issue any Common Units. As of the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company sold and issued 11,894,188 Common Units at an aggregate purchase price of $100 per unit. The activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is a follows:

   6. Members  Capital (continued)   
   
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company processed $178,435 of
deemed distributions and re-contributions.     7. Credit Facility   
 On November 12, 2014, the Company entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement, by and between the Company, as borrower, and
Natixis, New York Branch, as administrative agent and committed lender ( Natixis ). That agreement was subsequently amended pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of December 22, 2014, by and among the Company,
Natixis, and various lenders party thereto, which was then further amended pursuant to a second amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of July 1, 2015 (as so amended and restated, the  Credit Agreement ).  
 The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit line of up to $750 million (the  Maximum Commitment ) (with sublimits for
letters of credit of up to $50 million and short-term  swingline  loans of up to $10 million) (the  Credit Facility ), subject to an available borrowing base which is generally, a percentage of remaining unfunded commitments from
certain eligible Members, (the  Borrowing Base  or  Available Amount ), and is secured by the undrawn commitments together with the recallable amounts of the Company s Members generally. The initial lender commitment was
$250 million which periodically increased up to an aggregate amount of $750 million. The stated maturity date of the Credit Agreement is November 10, 2017, unless such date is extended at the Company s option no more than two times for a
term of up to twelve months per such extension. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) adjusted eurodollar rate calculated in a customary manner plus 1.70%, (b) commercial paper rate plus 1.70%,
or (c) a base rate calculated in a customary manner (which will never be less than the adjusted eurodollar rate plus 1.00%) plus 0.70%. The Credit Facility may be terminated, and any outstanding amounts thereunder may become due and payable,
should the Company fail to satisfy certain covenants. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Maximum Commitment was $750 million and the Available Amount was $622 million under the Credit Facility
Borrowing Base. As of December 31, 2015, the Maximum Commitment and the Available Amount was $750 million. The Available Amount decreased from $750 million to $622 million as of August 30, 2016 in conjunction with recent capital activity
that decreased the remaining Undrawn Commitments together with the Recallable Amount of the Company s Members. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility were $572 million and
$329 million, respectively. The carrying amount of the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, which is categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximates its fair
value. Valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value include Company details, credit, market and liquidity risk and events, financial health of the Company, place in the capital structure, interest rate and terms and
condition. The Company incurred $6,415 in connection with obtaining the Credit Facility, which the Company has recorded as deferred financing costs on its Consolidated Statements of Asset and Liabilities and is amortizing these fees over the life of
the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $2,548 and $4,263, respectively, of such prepaid deferred financing costs had yet to be amortized.  
 The summary information regarding the Credit Facility for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as
follows:

   8. Income Taxes   
 The Company has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as the
Company maintains its status as a RIC, it will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. Federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its common unitholders as dividends. The Company
elected to be taxed as a RIC in 2015. Built-in gains by a C-Corp transferred to a RIC are subject to tax. The Company does not anticipate a tax on its built-in gains due its current net operating losses.  
  Federal Income Taxes     It
is the policy of the Company to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and distribute all of its net taxable income and any net realized gains on investments to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s
aggregate investment unrealized appreciation and depreciation for federal income tax purposes were as follows:      
   The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015, nor were there any increases
or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits for the period then ended; and therefore no interest or penalties were accrued. The Company is subject to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities for returns filed for the prior three and four
fiscal years, respectively.

   9. Financial Highlights   
 Selected data for a unit outstanding throughout the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is presented below. The accrual base Net
Asset Value is calculated by subtracting the per unit loss from investment operations from the beginning Net Asset Value per unit and reflects all units issued and outstanding.  

(1)   
 Net increase in Common Unitholder NAV from prior year is a one-time adjustment to account for the increase in the Common Units issued from January 1, 2015 through the final closing date of March 19, 2015.

(2)   
 Per unit data was calculated using the number of common units issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2016.    

(3)   
 The Total Return for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were calculated by taking the net income (loss) of the Company for the period divided by the weighted average capital contributions
from the members during the period. The return is net of management fees and expenses.    

(4)   
 The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) since inception for the Common Unitholders , after management fees, financing costs and operating expenses is 3.1% through September 30, 2016. The IRR is computed based on cash
flow due dates contained in notices to Member s (contributions from and distributions to the Common Unitholders) and the net assets (residual value) of the Members  capital account at period end. The IRR is calculated based on the fair
value of investments using principles and methods in accordance with GAAP and does not necessarily represent the amounts that may be realized from sales or other dispositions. Accordingly, the return may vary significantly upon realization.

 Annualized except for organizational costs.

  Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, some
of those assumptions are based on the work of third parties and any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and
other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law. The
safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the 1934 Act, which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this report because we are an investment company.  
  Overview     TCW Direct Lending LLC was formed on
April 1, 2014 as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. We have filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have also elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under
the Code for the taxable year ending December 31, 2015 and subsequent years. We are required to continue to meet the minimum distribution and other requirements for RIC qualification. As such, we will be required to comply with various
regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in  qualifying assets,  source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90% of our
taxable income and tax-exempt interest.    Each investor was required to enter into a subscription agreement in connection with its Commitment (a
 Subscription Agreement ). Under the terms of the subscription agreements, the Company may generally draw down all or any portion of the undrawn commitment with respect to each Common Unit upon at least ten business days  prior
written notice to the Unitholders. Investors have entered into subscription agreements for 20,134,698 Common Units of the Company issued and outstanding representing a total of $2.013 billion of committed capital.  
 On September 19, 2016, the Company formed TCW Direct Lending Luxembourg VI S. .r.l., ( TCW Direct Lending Luxembourg ) a private limited
liability company under the laws of Luxembourg, of which the Company owns 100% of the membership interests.     Revenues   
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income and capital appreciation by providing private capital to middle market companies operating in a broad range
of industries primarily in the United States. We do not anticipate the Direct Lending Team to originate investments for us with PIK interest features, although, we may have investments with payment-in-kind ( PIK ) interest features in
limited circumstances involving debt restructurings or work-outs of current investments. Our highly negotiated private investments may include senior secured loans, unsecured senior loans, subordinated and mezzanine loans, convertible securities,
equity securities, and equity-linked securities such as options and warrants. However, our investment bias will be towards adjustable-rate, senior secured loans. We do not anticipate a secondary market developing for our private investments.  
 We are primarily focused on investing in senior secured debt obligations, although there may be occasions where the investment may be unsecured. We also
consider an equity investment as the primary security, in combination with a debt obligation, or as a part of total return strategy. Our investments are mostly in corporations, partnerships or other business entities. Additionally, in certain
circumstances, we may co-invest with other investors and/or strategic partners through indirect investments in portfolio companies through a joint venture vehicle, partnership or other special purpose vehicle (each, an  Investment
Vehicle ). While we invest primarily in U.S. companies, there may be certain instances where we will invest in companies domiciled elsewhere.  
  Expenses     We do not currently have any employees and do
not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided through the Administration Agreement and the Advisory Agreement.    We
will bear (including by reimbursing the Adviser or Administrator) all costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, without limitation, organizational and offering expenses, management fees, costs of reporting
required under applicable securities laws, legal fees of our counsel and accounting fees. However, we will not bear (a) more than an amount equal to 10 basis points of the aggregate Commitments for organization and offering expenses in
connection with the offering of Common Units through the Closing Period and (b) more than an amount equal to 12.5 basis points of the aggregate Commitments per annum (pro-rated for partial years) for our Operating Expenses, including amounts
paid to the Administrator under the Administration Agreement and reimbursement of expenses to the Adviser and its affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cap on Operating Expenses does not apply to payments of the Management Fee, Incentive
Fee, organizational and offering expenses (which are subject to the separate cap described above), amounts payable in connection with our borrowings (including interest, bank fees, legal fees and other transactional expenses related to any borrowing
or borrowing facility and similar costs), costs and expenses relating to our liquidation of the Company, taxes, or extraordinary expenses (such as litigation expenses and indemnification payments to either the Adviser or the Administrator). All
expenses that we will not bear will be borne by the Adviser or its affiliates.

  Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollar
amounts in thousands):      
   Our total operating expenses were $12.4 million and $10.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Our operating expenses include management fees attributed to the Adviser of $7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The increase in interest and credit facility expenses during three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 reflect the increase our business activity and related increase in credit facility outstanding. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred $0.1
million in organization costs associated with the formation of TCW Direct Lending Luxembourg VI S. .r.l. Other expenses are consistent with prior year amounts.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our net operating expenses were $34.7 million and $34.0 million, respectively. Our operating
expenses include management fees attributed to the Adviser of $22.7 million and $27.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $27.8
million included $5.0 million for the final placements of Common Units from the Initial Closing Date of September 14, 2014 through those closings. Operating expenses in all categories except directors  fees increased during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and reflect Company expenses consistent with regular operations versus the prior period s commencement of operations activity. Net expenses during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 include an expense recapture of $0.3 million which offset the expense reimbursement by the Investment Adviser of $0.3 million in 2014 related to the expense limitation on organization expenses as outlined in the
Advisory Agreement.     Net investment income (loss)   
 Our net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $18.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The income for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to current operations and the increase in the number of debt investments from 8 as of September 30, 2015 to 19 as of September 30, 2016 for the Company. The income for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 was attributable to the commencement of investment operations and a full quarter of interest income earned on loans originated in the three months ended June 30, 2015, as well as the loans originated in the
three months ended September 30, 2015.

  Our net investment income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $44.2 million and
($16.6) million, respectively. The income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to current operations and the increase in the number of debt investments as of September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 as
well as a greater number of debt investments which earned interest income for the entire nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015. The loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was attributable to
the commencement of investment operations and ongoing costs in the period.     Net realized gains on non-controlled/non-affiliated investments   
 Net realized gain on non-controlled/non-affiliated investments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.2 million and $0.3 million,
respectively. The realized gain on investments from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the realization of gains related to our term loan to Harvest Hill Beverage
Company, while the gains during the three months ended September 30, 2015 were due to the realization of gains related to Nice-Pak Products, Inc.,  
 Net realized gains on non-controlled/non-affiliated investments was $0.3 million and $2.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. The realized gain on investments from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the realization of gains related to our term loan to Harvest Hill Beverage
Company. The net realized gains during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulted primarily from the transfer of investments to TCW Direct Lending Strategic Ventures LLC and the corresponding realization of origination fees from the
transferred investments.     Net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on non-controlled/non-affiliated investments   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on non-controlled/non-affiliated investments was a
decrease of $1.1 million and is primarily attributable to our equity investment in Verus Financial, LLC which recorded a decrease of $0.7 million in fair value for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2015, our net change in unrealized appreciation on investments totaled $1.2 million and resulted primarily from
three loans originated in during the quarter.    For the nine months September 30, 2016, our net change in unrealized depreciation on investments
totaled $16.5 million and is primarily attributable to the our term loans to H-D Advanced Manufacturing and Frontier Spinning Mills, Inc. which recorded decreases in fair value of $18.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively, during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. These were partially offset by $1.9 million in unrealized appreciation on our term loan Harvest Hill Beverage Company, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company s remaining investments
recorded a net unrealized appreciation of $2.0 million.    For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our net change in unrealized appreciation on
investments totaled $6.0 million and resulted from investments originated in 2014 and 2015.     Net change in unrealized appreciation on controlled
affiliated investments     Our net change unrealized appreciation from controlled affiliated investments was $3.3 million and $3.0 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This activity relates to loans originated in 2016 and undistributed profits from TCW Strategic Ventures for which commenced operation in June 2015.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our net change unrealized appreciation from controlled affiliated investments was $11.8 million
and $3.4 million, respectively resulting from loans originated in 2016 and undistributed profits from TCW Strategic Ventures.     Net increase (decrease)
in members  capital from operations     Our net increase in Members  Capital from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was $20.7 million and $5.0 million, respectively. This increase reflects the increase in operations, loan originations and activity versus the prior year where we had just commenced operations.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 our net increase in members  capital from operations was $39.9 million versus a decrease of $4.9
million in for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase reflects the increase in operations, loan originations and activity vs. the prior year where we had just commenced operations.

   Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 On March 19, 2015 we completed the final private placement of Common Units. We generate cash from (1) drawing down capital in respect of Units,
(2) cash flows from investments and operations and (3) borrowings from banks or other lenders.    Our primary use of cash is for
(1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (2) the cost of operations (including expenses, the management fee, the incentive fee, and any indemnification
obligations), (3) debt service of any borrowings and (4) cash distributions to the Unitholders.    As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, aggregate Commitment, Undrawn Commitments and subscribed for Units of the Company are as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):      
    Natixis Credit Agreement   
 On November 12, 2014, the Company entered into a senior secured Revolving Credit Agreement, by and between the Company, as borrower, and Natixis, New York
Branch, as administrative agent and committed lender ( Natixis ). That agreement was subsequently amended pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2014, by and among the Company, Natixis, and
various lenders party thereto, which was then further amended pursuant to a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2015 (as so amended and restated, the  Credit Agreement ).  
 The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit line of up to $750 million (with sublimits for letters of credit of up to $50 million and short-term
 swingline  loans of up to $10 million), subject to the available Borrowing Base (generally, a percentage of remaining unfunded commitments from certain eligible Company investors), and is secured by the undrawn commitments together with
the recallable amounts of the Company s investors generally. The initial lender commitment was $250 million which periodically increased up to an aggregate amount of $750 million. The stated maturity date of the Credit Agreement is
November 10, 2017, unless such date is extended at the Company s option no more than two times for a term of up to twelve months per such extension. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either
(a) adjusted eurodollar rate calculated in a customary manner plus 1.70%, (b) commercial paper rate plus 1.70%, or (c) a base rate calculated in a customary manner (which will never be less than the adjusted eurodollar rate plus
1.00%) plus 0.70%.    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the credit facility commitment amounts were $750 million and the amounts
outstanding under the Credit Facility were $572 million and $329 million, respectively. The carrying amount of the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility, which is categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximates its fair value. Valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value include Company details, credit, market and liquidity risk and events, financial health of the
Company, place in the capital structure, interest rate and terms and condition. The Company incurred $6.4 million in connection with obtaining the Credit Facility, which the Company has recorded as deferred financing costs on its statement of asset
and liabilities and is amortizing these fees over the life of the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $2.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of such prepaid deferred financing costs had yet to be
amortized.     Investment Activity     Based on fair value
as of September 30, 2016, our non-controlled/non-affiliated portfolio was comprised by 21 debt investments and one equity investment. Of these investments, 99.2% were debt investments which were primarily senior secured, first lien or term
loans and 0.8% was common stock. As of September 30, 2015, the 8 debt investments outstanding were 100% first lien investments.

  Direct Lending Strategic Ventures LLC     On June 5,
2015, the Company, together with an affiliate of Security Benefit Corporation and accounts managed by Oak Hill Advisors, L.P., entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the  Agreement ) to become members of
TCW Direct Lending Strategic Ventures LLC ( TCW Strategic Ventures ). TCW Strategic Ventures will focus primarily on making senior secured floating rate loans to middle-market borrowers. The Agreement was effective June 5, 2015.  
 The Company s capital commitment is $481.6 million, representing approximately 80% of the preferred and common equity ownership of TCW Strategic
Ventures, with the third-party investors representing the remaining capital commitments and preferred and common equity ownership. A portion of the Company s capital commitment was satisfied by the contribution of two loans to TCW Strategic
Ventures. TCW Strategic Ventures also entered into a $500 million revolving credit facility to finance a portion of certain eligible investments on June 5, 2015. Effective August 21, 2015, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the
revolving credit facility to $600 million from $500 million. TCW Strategic Ventures is managed by a management committee comprised of two members, one appointed by the Company and one appointed by Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. All decisions of the
management committee require unanimous approval of its members. Neither the Company, nor the Adviser will receive management fees from this entity. Although the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of TCW Strategic Ventures, the
Company does not believe that it has control over TCW Strategic Ventures (other than for purposes of the Investment Company Act).    The Company s
investments in affiliated investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:

    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ.  
 In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We consider
these accounting policies to be critical because they involve management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
These judgments will affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in  Item 1A. Risk
Factors  in the Form 10-K that we filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016  
      33  

Table of Contents  

  Investments which we hold for which market quotes are not readily available or are not considered reliable are
valued at fair value and approved by our Board of Directors based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs.  
 Fair Value Hierarchy: Assets and liabilities are classified by us based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value into three levels.  
 Level 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets.  
 Level 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and quoted prices in inactive
markets or other market observable inputs.    Level 3 values are based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect our determination of
assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets.    Categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.  
  Level 1 Assets (Investments):  The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows:  
  Registered Investment Companies, (Level 1),  include registered open-end investment companies that are valued based upon the reported net
asset value of such investment.     Level 3 Assets (Investments):  The following valuation techniques and significant inputs are used to determine fair
value of investments in private debt for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal assumptions applied are unobservable.  
  Debt, (Level 3) , include investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing
models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A discounted cash flow approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital is generally used to determine fair value. Valuation may also include a shadow
rating method. Standard pricing inputs include but are not limited to the financial health of the issuer, place in the capital structure, value of other issuer debt, credit, industry, and market risk and events.  
  Equity , (Level 3), include common stock. Such securities are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the
weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A market approach is generally used to determine fair value. Pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, financial health, and relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA, market multiples
of comparable companies, comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market events; contractual or legal restrictions on the sale of the security. A liquidity discount based on current market expectations,
future events, minority ownership position and the period management reasonably expects to hold the investment may be applied.    Pricing
inputs and weightings applied to determine value require subjective determination. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that may eventually be realized form sales or other dispositions of investments.  
  Net Asset Value ( NAV ) (Investment Funds and Vehicles):  Equity investments in affiliated investment fund (Strategic Ventures) are valued
based on the NAV reported by the investment fund. Investments held by the affiliated fund include debt investments in privately originated senior secured debt. Such investments held by the affiliated fund are valued using the same methods, approach
and standards applied above to debt investments held by the Company. The Company s ability to withdraw from the fund is subject to restrictions. The term of the fund will continue until June 5, 2021 unless dissolved earlier or extended for
two additional one-year periods by the Company, in its full discretion. The Company can further extend the term of the fund for additional one-year periods, upon notice to and consent from the funds management committee. The Company is entitled to
income and principal distributed by the fund.

including changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2016, 100.0% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, such as LIBOR, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally
reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months. At September 30, 2016, the percentage of our floating rate debt investments that bore interest based on an interest rate floor was 100.0%. Floating rate investments subject
to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months only if the index exceeds the floor. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates.
Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant
change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We assess our portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event
that interest rates increase. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates.  
 Based on our September 30, 2016 balance sheet, the following table shows the annual impact on net income (excluding the related incentive compensation
impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure (dollar amounts in thousands):  

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures       As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information
relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.    There have been no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

     PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.  
  Legal Proceedings       We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our
knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under loans to
or other contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of
operations.      

Item 1A.  
  Risk Factors       There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds         Sales of unregistered securities

respect to each Common Unit upon at least ten business days  prior written notice to the unitholders. The issuance of the Common Units pursuant to these subscription agreements and any draw by the Company under the related commitments is
expected to be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof, and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D thereunder.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)        

1.  
  ORGANIZATION        Investment Objective:  TCW Direct Lending Strategic Ventures
LLC (the  Fund ), is a closed-end investment company formed as a Delaware limited liability company for the purpose of investing in corporate senior secured middle-market floating rate loans. Investments may include other loans and
securities received as a result of the restructuring, workout or bankruptcy of an existing loan.     Limited Liability Company
Agreement:  The Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company agreement (the  Agreement ), dated June 5, 2015, was entered into by and among TCW Direct Lending LLC, an affiliated fund (also known as the  BDC ) and two
third-party members (the  Third-Party Members ). The BDC and each Third-Party Member own a Preferred Membership Interest (collectively the  Preferred Members ) and a Common Membership Interest (collectively the  Common
Members ) (together, the  Members ). The BDC owns 80% of the Preferred and Common Membership Interests and the Third-Party Members own the remaining 20% of Preferred and Common Membership Interests. The initial closing date of the
Fund was June 5, 2015 ( Initial Closing Date ).    The Agreement amends and restates the original agreement, dated
May 26, 2015 that the BDC entered into as the sole member of the Fund.     Term:  The Fund will continue until the sixth
anniversary of the Initial Closing Date unless dissolved earlier or extended for two additional one-year periods by the BDC, in its sole discretion upon notice to the Management Committee. Thereafter, the term of the Fund may be extended by the BDC
for additional one-year periods, in each case with the prior consent of the Management Committee.     Commitment Period:  The
Commitment Period commenced on June 5, 2015, the Initial Closing Date and will end on the third anniversary of the Initial Closing Date subject to termination or extension by the Management Committee as provided in the Agreement.  
  Management Committee:  Pursuant to the Agreement, the management committee of the Fund has exclusive responsibility for the
management, policies and control of the Fund. The BDC and one of the two Third-Party Members, collectively, each appointed one voting member of the Management Committee. The Management Committee can act on behalf and in the name of the Fund to
implement the objectives of the Fund and exercise any rights and powers the Fund may possess. The Management Committee will authorize portfolio investment activity, transactions between the Fund and the BDC, and other Members and borrowings of the
Fund.     Administration Agreement:  The Fund entered into an Administration Agreement with TCW Asset Management Company LLC
( TAMCO ), dated June 5, 2015 to furnish, or arrange for others to furnish, administrative services necessary for the operation of the Fund. In connection therein, TAMCO, as Administrator retained the services of State Street Bank and
Trust Company to assist in providing certain administrative, accounting, operational, investor and financial reporting services for the Fund.  
  Custody Services Agreement : The Fund entered into a Custody Services Agreement dated June 3, 2015 with State Street Bank and
Trust Company to provide custodian services for the Fund.     Capital Commitments:  Commitments from the Preferred Members and
Preferred Members as Common Members are as follows. The commitment amount funded does not include amounts contributed in anticipation of a potential investment that the Fund did not consummate and therefore returned to the Members  as unused
capital.

2.  
  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       The Fund is an investment company following the
accounting and reporting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 946 Financial Services   Investment Companies.  
  Basis of Presentation:  The Fund s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for investment companies.     Use of Estimates:  The preparation of
the accompanying financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  Investments:  The Fund records investment transactions on the trade date. The Fund considers trade date for investments not traded
on a recognizable exchange, or traded in the over-the-counter markets, to be the date on which the Fund receives legal or contractual title to the asset and bears the risk of loss.  
  Income Recognition:  Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis unless doubtful of collection or the related investment is in
default. Realized Gains and losses on investments are recorded on a specific identification basis. The Fund typically receives a fee in the form of a discount to the purchase price at the time it funds an investment in a loan. The discount is
accreted to interest income over the life of the respective loan, as reported in the Statement of Operations, and reflected in the amortized cost basis of the investment. Discounts associated with a revolver are treated as a discount to the
issuers  term loan. In the event there is a fee associated with a delayed draw that remains unfunded, the Fund will recognize the fee as fee income immediately. Ongoing facility, commitment or other additional fees including prepayment fees,
consent fees and forbearance fees are recognized immediately when earned as income.     Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The Fund
considers cash equivalents to be liquid investments, including money market funds or individual securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. Fund cash and cash equivalents are generally comprised of money market funds and
demand deposits, valued at cost, which approximates fair value.  
      9  

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Continued)    
  Income Taxes:  The Fund is exempt from federal and state income taxes and, consequently, no income tax provision has been made in
the accompanying financial statements.    The Fund has invested in numerous jurisdictions and is therefore subject to varying policies
and statutory time limitations with respect to examination of tax positions. The Fund reviews and evaluates tax positions in its major jurisdictions and determines whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement
recognition.    The Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as an income tax expense in
the Statement of Operations. As of and during the period ended September 30, 2016, the Fund did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits nor did it recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.  
 The Fund is subject to examination by U.S. federal tax authorities for returns filed for the prior three years and by state tax
authorities for returns filed for the prior four years.     Subsequent Events:  The Management Committee evaluated the activity
of the Fund through November 10, 2016, the date that the financial statements are available to be issued, and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition or disclosure.  

3.  
  INVESTMENT VALUATIONS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS        Investments at Fair
Value:  Investments held by the Fund for which market quotes are readily available are valued at fair value. Fair value is generally determined on the basis of last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary exchange in which
each security trades, or if no sales are reported, based on the midpoint of the valuation range obtained for debt investments from a quotation reporting system, established market makers or pricing service.  
 Investments held by the Fund for which market quotes are not readily available or market quotations are not considered reliable are
valued at fair value by the Management Committee based on similar instruments, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs.  
  Fair Value Hierarchy:  Assets and liabilities are classified by the Fund based on valuation inputs used to determine fair value
into three levels.    Level 1 values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets.  
 Level 2 values are based on significant observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and quoted prices in inactive markets or
other market observable inputs.    Level 3 values are based on significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Fund s determination of
assumptions that market participants might reasonably use in valuing the assets.    Categorization within the hierarchy is based upon
the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities.

  September 30, 2016     The
following is a summary by major security type of the fair valuations according to inputs used in valuing investments listed in the Schedule of Investments.      
    Level 3 Roll Forward : The following is a reconciliation of Level 3 investments:  
   
   Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the beginning of the reporting
period in which they occur. During the period ended September 30, 2016 the Fund did not have any transfers between levels.  
  Level 1 Assets (Investments):  The valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value are as follows:  
  Registered Investment Companies,  (Level 1), include registered open-end investment companies that are valued based upon the
reported net asset value of such investment.     Level 3 Assets (Investments):  The following valuation techniques and
significant inputs are used to determine fair value of investments in private debt for which reliable market quotations are not available. Some of the inputs are independently observable however, a significant portion of the inputs and the internal
assumptions applied are unobservable.     Debt , (Level 3), includes investments in privately originated senior secured debt.
Such investments are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. A discounted cash flow approach incorporating a weighted average cost of capital approach and shadow rating
method are generally used to determine fair value. Standard pricing inputs include, but are not limited to, the financial health of the issuer: place in the capital structure; value of other issuer debt; credit, industry, and market risk and events.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Continued)    
  Preferred Equity  (Level 3), includes investments in preferred equity issued under the same market conditions as the privately
originated senior secured debt. Such investments are valued based on specific pricing models, internal assumptions and the weighting of the best available pricing inputs. The relative value approach is used. Relative value takes into account the
implied yield of the senior secured debt measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return relative to the debt. Pricing inputs include, but not limited to, financial health, and relevant business developments of the issuer; EBITDA, market multiples
of comparable companies, comparable market transactions and recent trades or transactions; issuer, industry and market expectations, risks and events.  
 Pricing inputs and weightings applied to determine value require subjective determination. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily
represent the amounts that may eventually be realized from sales or other dispositions of investments.    The following table
summarizes by major security type the valuation techniques and quantitative information utilized in determining the fair value of the Level 3 investments.      
    Valuation Process:  Oversight for determining fair value is the responsibility of the Management
Committee (with input from an independent valuation firm retained by the Fund). The Fund values the investments at fair value on a quarterly basis and whenever required. The Fund engaged an external, independent valuation firm to assist the
Management Committee in determining the fair market value of the Fund s investments for which market quotations are not readily available.  
 The Fund and its Management Committee undertakes a multi-step valuation process for investments whose market prices are not otherwise
readily available. The valuation process begins with each investment being preliminarily valued by the Management Committee. The Fund s external, independent valuation firm also values the investments and provides a valuation range. Based
on its own valuation and a review of the external, independent valuation firm s range and related documentation, valuation of the Fund s investments are determined by the Management Committee.  
 The Fund uses all relevant factors in determining fair value including, without limitation, any of the following factors as may be deemed
relevant by the Committee: current financial position and current and historical operating results of the issuer; sales prices of recent public or private transactions in the same or similar securities, including transactions on any securities
exchange on which such securities are listed or in the over-the-counter market; general level of interest rates; recent trading volume of the security; restrictions on transfer including the Fund s right, if any, to require registration of its
securities by the issuer under the securities laws; any liquidation preference or other special feature or term of the security; significant recent events affecting the Portfolio Investment, including any pending private placement, public offering,
merger, or acquisition; the price paid by the Fund to acquire the asset; the percentage of the issuer s outstanding securities that is owned by the Fund and all other factors affecting value.
