      (unaudited)    

1.   Organization   
 Lithium Exploration Group, Inc. (formerly Mariposa Resources,
Ltd.) (the  Company ) was incorporated on May 31, 2006 in the State of Nevada,
U.S.A. It is based in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The accounting and reporting
policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America, and the Company s fiscal year end is June 30.  
 Effective November 30, 2010, the Company changed its name to
 Lithium Exploration Group, Inc.,  by way of a merger with its wholly-owned
subsidiary Lithium Exploration Group, Inc., which was formed solely for the
change of name.  
 A wholly owned subsidiary, 1617437 Alberta Ltd. was
incorporated in the province of Alberta, Canada on July 8, 2011. Effective
October 2, 2013, the subsidiary changed its name to Alta Disposal Ltd. 
 On October 18, 2013, the Company acquired 51% interest in Alta
Disposal Morinville Ltd. (formerly Blue Tap Resources Ltd.). Effective September
4, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Cancen Oil
Canada whereby the Company agrees to sell all right, title and interest of Alta
Disposal Morinville Ltd. assets for total purchase price of CAD$10,000
approximately USD$7,466. 
 On March 1, 2014, the Company through its 100% subsidiary Alta
Disposal Ltd. acquired 50% interest in Tero Oilfield Services Ltd. (the  Tero )
On May 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with an
individual and disposed its 50% interest in Tero.  
 On September 9, 2016, the Company acquired 100% interest in
Black Box Energy, Inc. (Black Box Energy ) a Company incorporated in the state
of Nevada. 
 On September 9, 2016, the Company through its 100% subsidiary
Black Box Energy entered into an agreement with PetroChase Inc. to acquire a 50%
of a 70% of the working interest in the McKean County Project (Note 6). 
 The Company is engaged principally in the acquisition,
exploration, and development of resource properties. Prior to June 25, 2009, the
Company had the right to conduct exploration work on 20 mineral mining claims in
Esmeralda County, Nevada, U.S.A. On July 31, 2009, the Company acquired an
option to enter into a joint venture for the management and ownership of the
Jack Creek Project, a mining project located in Elko County, Nevada. On
September 25, 2009, the joint venture was terminated and the Company entered
into an agreement with Beeston Enterprises Ltd., under which the Company was
granted an option to acquire an undivided 50% interest in eight mineral claims
located in the Clinton Mining District of British Columbia, Canada. On December
16, 2010, the Company entered into an Assignment Agreement to acquire an
undivided 100% right, title and interest in and to certain mineral permits
located in the Province of Alberta, Canada (see Note 5). On November 8, 2011,
the Company entered into a letter agreement with Glottech-USA. Pursuant to the
terms of the agreement, the Company was granted an exclusive license to use and
distribute the technology within the Swan Hills region of Alberta as well as a
non-exclusive right to distribute the technology within Canada. 

2. Significant Accounting Policies   
  Basis of presentation and consolidation  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 
 These interim financial statements as of and for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited; however, in the opinion
of management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals)necessary to present fairly the financial position, results
of operations and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented. The
results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending June 30, 2017 or
for any future period. All references to September 30, 2016 and 2015 in these
footnotes are unaudited. 
 These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes
thereto for the year ended June 30, 2016, included in the Company s annual
report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 18, 2016. 
  Principal of Consolidation   
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Alta Disposal
Ltd., its 51% owned subsidiary Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. (formerly Bluetap
Resources Ltd.), and its 100% interest in Black Box Energy. Intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in conformity
with the applicable accounting framework. Note that no transactions occurred
within Black Box Energy as of September 30, 2016. 
  Use of Estimates   
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions,
uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future
operations of the Company. Significant estimates that may materially change in
the near term include the valuation of derivative liabilities and the underlying
warrants, as well as fair value of investments.  
  Cash and Cash Equivalents   
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market
funds, and certificates of term deposits with original maturities of less than
three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which,
in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in
value. The Company had $39,839 and $25,208 in cash and cash equivalents at
September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  

2. Significant Accounting Policies -
   Continued      
  Concentration of Risk   
 The Company maintains cash balances at a financial institution
which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
insured limits for banks located in the US. As of September 30, 2016 and June
30, 2016, the Company had no deposits in excess of federally insured limits in
its US bank. The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank
accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash in bank
accounts.  
  Prepaid expenses   
 Prepaid expenses consist of security deposit for office lease
which will be expensed or refunded at the end of the lease period. 
  Start-Up Costs   
 In accordance with FASC 720-15-20   Start-Up Costs,   the
Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and
organization of the Company.  
  Mineral Acquisition and Exploration Costs   
 The Company has been in the exploration stage since its
formation on May 31, 2006. It is primarily engaged in the acquisition,
exploration, and development of mining properties. Mineral property acquisition
and exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that
a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing
proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are
capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method
over the estimated life of the probable reserves.  
  Concentrations of Credit Risk   
 The Company s financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents
and related party payables it will likely incur in the near future. The Company
places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit
worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial
institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company s
management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any
parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated
credit risk exposures are limited.  
  Non-controlling Interest   
 The 49% third party ownership of Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd.
(formerly Blue Tap Resources Ltd.) at September 30, 2016 and 2015 are recorded
as non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Details
of changes in the non-controlling interests during the year ended June 30, 2016
and period ending September 30, 2016 are reflected in the condensed statement of
deficit.  
  Related Parties  
 Parties are considered to be related to the Company if the
parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties
also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the
immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and
other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can
significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an
extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully
pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all related party
transactions. All transactions shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or
services exchanged. Property purchased from a related party is recorded at the
cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party
in excess of the cost is reflected as a distribution to related party. 
  Net Income or (Loss) per Share of Common Stock   
 The Company has adopted FASC Topic No. 260,   Earnings Per
Share ,  ( EPS ) which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the
face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures
and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS
computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In
the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is
computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period.  
 Potentially dilutive securities are not presented in the
computation of EPS since their effects are anti-dilutive. The total number of
potential no. of dilutive shares is 567,742,813 as of September 30, 2016. 

2. Significant Accounting Policies -
   Continued      
  Foreign Currency Translations   
 The Company s functional and reporting currency is the US
dollar. All transactions initiated in other currencies are translated into US
dollars using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the
US dollar at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
Unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from such transactions are deferred
until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders 
equity (deficit) as a component of comprehensive income or loss. Upon
realization, the amount deferred is recognized in income in the period when it
is realized.  
 Translation of Foreign Operations  
 The financial results and position of foreign operations whose
functional currency is different from the Company s presentation currency are
translated as follows:  - assets and liabilities are translated at period-end
exchange rates prevailing at that reporting date;  - equity is translated at
historical exchange rates; and  - income and expenses are translated at
average exchange rates for the period. 
 Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign
operations are transferred directly to the Company s accumulated other
comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains and
losses arising from exchange rate fluctuation on transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency are included in the consolidated
statements of operations.  
 The relevant translation rates are as follows: For the period
ending September 30, 2016 closing rate at 0.7624 CDN$: US$, average rate at
0.7665 CDN$: US$ and for the year ended June 30, 2016 closing rate at 0.769
CDN$: US$, average rate at 0.7761 CDN$: US$. For the period ending September 30,
2015 closing rate at 0.7466 CDN$: US$, average rate at 0.7637 CDN$: US$.  
  Comprehensive Income (Loss)   
 FASC Topic No. 220,   Comprehensive Income,   establishes
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components
in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. As at September 30, 2016
and June 30, 2016, the Company had no material items of other 
 comprehensive income except for the foreign currency translation
adjustment. 
  Risks and Uncertainties   
 The Company operates in the resource exploration industry that
is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial,
operational, technological, and other risks associated with operating a resource
exploration business, including the potential risk of business failure.  

2. Significant Accounting Policies -    Continued   
 
 Environmental Expenditures   
 
The operations of the Company have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new
regulations and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not predictable. The Company's policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically proven and economically feasible
measures.  
 
Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefits. All of these types of expenditures incurred
since inception have been charged against earnings due to the uncertainty of their future recoverability.  Estimated future reclamation and site restoration costs, when the ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings
over the estimated remaining life of the related business operation, net of expected recoveries.  
 
 Warrants   
 
The Company accounts for currently outstanding detachable warrants to purchase common stock as derivative liabilities as they are freestanding derivative financial instruments. The warrants are recorded as derivative liabilities at fair value,
estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, and marked to market at each balance sheet date, with changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon
exercise of a derivative financial instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and is reclassified to equity. 
 
 Convertible Instruments   
 
The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging . It provide three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion
options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not
clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise
applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.
The result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative financial instrument and is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the
fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative financial instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at
the conversion date and is reclassified to equity.The Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the
underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of notes
redemption   

2. Significant Accounting Policies -    Continued   
  Extinguishment of Debt  
 ASC 470-50-40,   Debt Modification and Extinguishments  ,  requires an entity for the refinancing and modification of the prior debt in a  non troubled debt situation to treat as either an extinguishment or a  modification based on whether the present value of the cash flows under the  terms of the new debt instrument is different by greater than, or less than,  10% from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the  original instrument. For cash flow changes greater than 10%, the debt  modification is accounted for as a debt extinguishment, whereby the original  debt is derecognized and the new debt is initially recorded at fair value, with  the difference recognized as an extinguishment gain or loss. 
 Upon  determination that debt should be extinguished in accordance with ASC 470-50,  the Convertible Promissory Notes and the respective derivative liability are  expensed as extinguishment of debt. The Warrants are extinguished in accordance  with ASC 815-10. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 
ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based
on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:  
 
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
 
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  
 
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing.  
 
The carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, deposit, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and due to a related party approximate their fair values because of
the short maturity of these instruments.  
 
The Company s Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the liability of the Company s secured convertible promissory notes and debentures issued to investors, and the derivative warrants issued in connection with these convertible
promissory notes and debentures. There is no current market for these securities such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. The Company used a fair value model which incorporates transaction details such
as Company stock price, contractual terms, maturity, risk free rates, as well as assumptions about future financings, volatility, and holder behavior as of the date of issuance and each balance sheet date.  
 
 Revenue Recognition   
 
The Company has generated little revenues to date. It is the Company s policy that revenue from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with ASC 605  Revenue Recognition . Four basic criteria must be met before
revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on
management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product/services was not delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the
product/service has been delivered or no refund will be required.  
 
Sales comprise the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and rendering of services in the ordinary course of the Company s activities. Sales are presented, net of tax, rebates and discounts, and after
eliminating intercompany sales. The Company recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue and related cost can be reliably measured and it is probable that the collectability of the related receivables is reasonably assured.  
 
During the year ended June 30, 2016 and period ending September 30, 2016, the Company didn t record any revenue under continuing operation.  

2. Significant Accounting Policies -    Continued   
 
 Income Taxes   
 
The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10,  Income Taxes  which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset
any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.  
 
The Company also follows the provisions of ASC 740-10 related to accounting for uncertain income tax positions. When tax returns are filed, some positions taken may be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others may be subject
to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the
period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are
not offset or aggregated with other positions. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has had no uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative
expenses. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations nor has it had any federal or state examinations since its inception. 
 
 Receivables   
 
Trade and other receivables are customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are recorded at face value less any provisions for uncollectible amounts considered necessary. The Company includes any balances that are determined to be
uncollectible in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company recorded  Nil (June 30, 2016 -  Nil) in allowance for doubtful accounts.  
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 
In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. ASU 2016-16 will require the tax
effects of intercompany transactions, other than sales of inventory, to be recognized currently, eliminating an exception under current GAAP in which the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers are deferred until the transferred asset is sold to
a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2019 fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. 
 
In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU
2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance regarding the classification of certain items within the statements of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. 
 
In connection with its financial instruments project, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments in June 2016 and ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments - Overall:
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities in January 2016. 

2. Significant Accounting Policies -    Continued   

ASU 2016-13 introduces a new impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a forward-looking
 expected loss  model that will replace the current  incurred loss  model and generally will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2021
fiscal year, with early adoption in fiscal year 2020 permitted. 
 
ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other provisions, the new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in certain equity securities. For
investments without readily determinable fair values, entities have the option to either measure these investments at fair value or at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment. All changes in measurement will be recognized in
net income. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2019 fiscal year. Early adoption is not permitted, except for certain provisions relating to financial liabilities. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires, among other things, that entities measure equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of
the investee) at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Under the standard, entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale as a
component of other comprehensive income. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values the cost method of accounting is also eliminated, however subject to certain exceptions, entities will be able to elect to record equity
investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment and plus or minus adjustments for observable price changes, with all such changes recognized in earnings. This new standard does not change the guidance for classifying
and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. The standard is effective for us on July 1, 2018 (the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year). The Company is currently evaluating the anticipated impact of this standard on its consolidated
financial statements.  
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing
arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and
liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease
term. For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on
its consolidated financial statements.  
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) that clarifies how to apply revenue recognition guidance related to whether an
entity is a principal or an agent. ASU 2016-08 clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods or services before they are transferred to the customer and provides additional guidance about how to apply the
control principle when services are provided and when goods or services are combined with other goods or services. The effective date for ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-08 on its consolidated financial statements.  

2. Significant Accounting Policies -    Continued   
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the
income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal
year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding
requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments
related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess
tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the
statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and
understandability of licensing implementation guidance. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within those years. The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 
FASB ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  was issued in June 2016 and clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion, presentation of taxes
collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract modifications at transition, completed contracts at transition and how guidance in Topic 606 is retrospectively applied. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in
Topic 606. The effective dates are the same as those for Topic 606. 
 
 3. Capital Stock   
 
On January 19, 2015, the Company's board of directors consented to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of 20 old shares of common stock for one 1 new share of common stock. The
reverse stock split was reviewed and approved for filing by the FNRA effective February 25, 2015.  
 
On July 13, 2015, the Company's board of directors consented to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of 200 old shares of common stock for one 1 new share of common stock. The
reverse stock split was reviewed and approved for filing by the FNRA effective September 30, 2015. The Company s authorized capital will not be affected by the reverse stock split. The split is reflected retrospectively in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.  

3.    Capital Stock      Continued    Authorized Stock   
 
At inception, the Company authorized 100,000,000 common shares and 100,000,000 preferred shares, both with a par value of  0.001 per share. Each common share entitles the holder to one vote, in person or proxy, on any matter on which action of
the stockholders of the corporation is sought.  
 
On April 8, 2009, the Company increased the number of authorized shares to 600,000,000 shares, of which 500,000,000 shares are designated as common stock par value  0.001 per share, and 100,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock, par
value  0.001 per share.  
 
On October 25, 2012, the Company designated 20,000,000 series A convertible preferred stock with a par value of  0.001 per share and stated value of  100 per share. The designated preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder,
at any time beginning one year from the date such shares are issued, into common stock of the Company with a par value of  0.001. All shares of common stock of the Company, shall be of junior rank to all series A preferred stock in respect to
the preferences as to distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company. All other shares of preferred stock shall be of junior rank to all series A preferred shares in respect to the preferences as to
distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company.  
 
On January 3, 2014, the Company designated 2,000,000 series B convertible preferred stock with a par value  0.001 per share, issuable only in consideration of the extinguishment of existing debt convertible in to the Company s common stock
with a par value of  0.001. The designated preferred stock shall be issued on the basis of 1 preferred stock for each  1 of convertible debt. The series B convertible preferred stock shall be subordinate to and rank junior to all
indebtedness of the Company now or hereafter outstanding. 
 
On October 17, 2014, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation, which amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on October 17, 2014, to increase the authorized capital of its common shares from 500,000,000 common shares, par
value  0.001 to 2,000,000,000 common shares, par value  0.001. 
 
The Company's authorized capital consists of 2,000,000,000 common shares and 100,000,000 preferred shares, all with a par value of  0.001.  
 
Effective June 22, 2015, the Company designated 50,000,000 of its 100,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock as series A preferred stock. The series A preferred stock, par value  0.001, will rank senior to the Company s common stock,
carrying general voting rights with the common stock at the rate of 62 votes per share. The series A preferred stock will be deemed cancelled within 1 year of issuance and are not entitled to share in dividends or other distributions. So long as any
shares of series A preferred stock are outstanding, the affirmative vote of not less than 75% of those outstanding shares of series A preferred stock will be required for any change to the Company s Articles of Incorporation. 
 
Effective September 9, 2015, the Company increase the authorized capital of its common shares from 2,000,000,000 common shares, par value  0.001 to 10,000,000,000 common shares, par value  0.001.  
 
 Share Issuances   
 
Common Stock Issuance  
 
 For the year ended June 30, 2016:   

3.    Capital Stock      Continued    
 
During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 109,612,491 shares upon conversion of the convertible promissory notes and accrued interest, valued at  476,901. 
 
The Company also issued 2,577,896 shares, valued at  22,476 on cashless exercise of warrants during the year ended June 30, 2016. 
 
 For the period ended September 30, 2016:   
 
During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 42,951,240 common shares upon conversion of the convertible notes and accrued interest, valued at  21,475 (Note 6).  
 
 4. Provision for Income Taxes   
 
The Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are provided in the financial statements under
FASC 740-20-20 to give effect to the resulting temporary differences which may arise from differences in the bases of fixed assets, depreciation methods, allowances, and start-up costs based on the income taxes expected to be payable in future
years. 
 Exploration  stage deferred tax assets arising as a result of net operating loss  carryforwards have been offset completely by a valuation allowance due to the  uncertainty of their utilization in future periods. Operating loss  carryforwards generated during the period from May 31, 2006 (date of inception)  through September 30, 2016 of approximately $15,557,413 will begin to expire in 2026. Accordingly, deferred  tax assets were offset by the valuation allowance that increased by  approximately $237,188 and $795,006  during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. 
 
The Company follows the provisions of uncertain tax positions as addressed in FASC 740-10-65-1. The Company recognized approximately no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.  

4. Provision for Income Taxes -    Continued  
 
 The Company has no tax position at September 30, 2016 for which
the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty
about the timing of such deductibility. The Company recognizes interest accrued
related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in
operating expenses. No such interest or penalties were recognized during the
periods presented. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties at
September 30, 2016. The Company s utilization of any net operating loss carry
forward may be unlikely as a result of its intended exploration stage
activities. The tax years for June 30, 2015, June 30, 2014, June 30, 2013 and
June 30, 2012 are still open for examination by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS).  

5. Mineral Property Costs   
   Mineral Permit (Assignment Agreement with Lithium
Exploration VIII Ltd.)   
 On December 16, 2010, the Company entered into an Assignment
Agreement to acquire the following:  

a.)   
     
       An undivided 100% right, title and interest in and to
      certain mineral permits located in the Province of Alberta, Canada.

     All of the assignor s right,
      title and interest in and to the Option Agreement.    
 In consideration for the Assignment, the Company agreed to pay
US$90,000 by way of cash or stock of equal value (consisting of amounts
previously paid by the Assignor pursuant to the Option Agreement). The full
$90,000 (consisting of option payments  i  and  v  below) was expensed and

Optionor towards work assessment expenses acceptable to the Government of
Alberta, with any unused portion to be applied against payments required to
maintain the permits underlying the property in good   standing.  
 On December 31, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement to
amend the original payment requirement of CDN$100,000 due on January 1, 2013 to
the following payments: CDN $20,000 (paid) cash payment due on January 1, 2013
and CDN $80,000 by a 15% one year promissory note starting January 1, 2013. The
promissory note is interest free until June 30, 2013. After then, interest will
accrue on the principal balance then in arrears at the rate of 15% per annum. No
payments shall be payable until December 31, 2013. At any time, the Optionor may
elect to convert the remaining balance of CDN $80,000 plus accrued interest into
common shares of the Company at 75% of the closing market price of the Company s
common shares on the election day. The full CDN$100,000 (US$95,008) (consisting
of cash payment of CDN$20,000 (US$19,164) and note payable of CDN$80,000
(US$75,844) was expensed. The note is subject to be measured at its fair value
in accordance with ASC 480-10-25-14. The fair value at issuance was CDN$106,667
(US$101,125) as of June 30, 2013. An additional $26,667 was charged to mining
expense during the year June 30, 2013. An interest expense of CDN$3,058
(US$2,899) was accrued as at June 30, 2013. On July 3, 2013, the Optionor
elected to convert the promissory note of CDN $80,000 (US$75,844) plus accrued
interest of CDN$3,058 (US$2,899) for the total amount of CDN $83,058 (US$78,743)
into 239 common shares of the Company at a price of US$330 per share. The
January 1, 2014 payment was not paid by the Company, and subsequent to the
schedule payment date, the agreement was terminated.  

5. Mineral Property Costs -    Continued   
   Glottech Technology      
 On March 17, 2011 and subsequently amended on November 18,
2011, the Company entered into a letter agreement to acquire one initial unit of
proprietary and patented mechanical ultrasound technology for use in water
purification, inclusive of its process of separating from water, as the primary
fluid stock, the salt and other minerals and by  products contained therein,
with Glottech   USA. 
 To acquire the unit, the Company must make the following

a)  
     
       US$25,000 upon execution of the agreement
  (paid);   

b)  
     
       US$75,000 within 180 days of execution of the agreement
      (paid);   

c)  
     
       US$700,000 within 10 days of receipt of invoice from

d)  
     
       The Company also granted an option to acquire 500 shares
      for $1.00 to Glottech   USA upon receipt of the operational ultrasonic
      generator that they are building for Lithium Exploration Group. The 500
      shares are to be paid from outstanding shares owned by Alex Walsh, company
      CEO. During the year ended June 30, 2011, the option resulting in
      additional mining expenses of $4,940,000 was valued using the fair market
      value of the shares to be issued. On October 1, 2012, Alex Walsh and GD
      International entered into an agreement to transfer 500 common shares
      owned by Alex Walsh to GD International. The shares were received by GD
      International on October 29, 2012.    
 Commencing as of the end of an initial sixty day testing and
training period following satisfactory delivery and physical setup of the
technology, and continuing thereafter for as long as the technology remains in
the possession of the Company, the Company shall pay continuing monthly
royalties in an amount equal to $2.00 per physical ton of water processed
pursuant to the usage of the technology.  
 On June 12, 2012, the Company filed a complaint with the court
of common pleas of Chester County, Pennsylvania against Glottech   USA, LLC,
Eldredge, Inc., and the Eldredge Companies, Inc. The complaint seeks an order of
the court granting possession of the unit, in its current state, to the
Company. 
 Effective August 14, 2012, the Company entered into an option
agreement with GD Glottech-International, Limited ( GD International ) to
protect our license and distribution rights in the event that GD-Glottech-USA,
LLC ( GD USA ) is unable to perform and honor the obligations contingent to a
letter agreement dated November 8, 2011.  
 Pursuant to the terms of the option agreement, we are required
to provide an initial deposit of $150,000 to be held in escrow for the option to
obtain a license on the patent rights, as set forth in the option agreement. A
further $15,000 was required for exercising the option agreement and it will be
credited to future fees when patents rights are exercised. We exerised this
option agreement on September 1, 2012 and released the funds to GD
International.  
 On October 1, 2012, the Company entered into a sales agency
agreement with GD International. The agreement shall replace all agreements
entered previously. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is appointed as GD
International s sales agent for the technology within the territory. As a
consideration, 10,000 common shares of the Company shall be issued to GD
International (issued: see d) above). GD International retains all right, title
and interest in the technology. The term of this agreement will be an initial
period of five years. The term shall be automatically renewable thereafter for
successive five year periods provided that the Company has sold not less than 25
or more technology units during each applicable five year period.  

5. Mineral Property Costs -    Continued   
 On May 2, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to retain
the future use of the unit. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company must make the
following payments:

      (paid);   

b)  
     
       US$30,000 within three days upon the testing of the unit
      has been successfully completed.    
  6. Deposits in PetroChase, Inc.   
 On September 9, 2016, the Company acquired 100% interest in
Black Box Energy, Inc. a company incorporated in the State of Nevada. Black Box
Energy will purchase 50% of the working interest in the McKean County Project

   Management Fees Payment for an amount of $30,000 within 90 days after the
  Second Payment.   
 The first two payments have been made to PetroChase, Inc. as at
September 30, 2016 and appear as Deposit on Balance sheet.  
  7. Non- Convertible Promissory Notes  
 On September 1, 2016, The Company entered into letter
agreements with five separate investors with the intent to buyout their
convertible promissory notes and warrants. Pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement, the investors have agreed to a standstill period until September 16,
2016. The buyout will take place over a six month period of time and will result
in an aggregate of $252,856 in debt being retired, an aggregate of $195,500 in
warrants being retired and an aggregate buyout amount of $460,000 will be paid
over the period.  
 Summary of the non-convertible promissory notes at June 30,
2016 and September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

The above promissory notes are short-term notes that carry no
interest. They are expected to be settled by cash in instalments throughout
fiscal year 2017. All of the non-convertible promissory notes are expected to
mature and be settled within fiscal year 2017.  

8. Convertible Promissory Notes   
 Summary of convertible promissory note at June 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

8. Convertible Promissory Notes      Continued
   
 On August 12, 2016 Company issued an aggregate of $46,750
Convertible Promissory Notes with an issuance discount of $4,250 and $2,500 for
legal fees that matures on August 12, 2017. These notes bear 10% interest per
annum and the Holder of this Note is entitled, at its option, at any time, to
convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then
outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to 65% of
the lowest trading price of the Common Stock as reported on the OTC Markets for
the twenty prior trading days including the day upon which a Notice of
Conversion is received.  
 The Company identified embedded derivatives related to the
Convertible Promissory Notes. These embedded derivatives included certain
conversion features. The accounting treatment of derivative financial
instruments requires that the Company record the fair value of the derivatives
as of the inception date of the Convertible Promissory Note and to adjust the
fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. At the inception of the

intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the next twelve months.  
 
The ability of the Company to emerge from the exploration stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, explore and develop the mineral properties and the discovery, development and sale of ore
reserves.

uncertainty.

We have  not generated significant revenues since inception and have incurred $213,740 and $146,809 in operating expenses for  the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 
The following provides selected financial data about our company for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30,
2016 increased to $213,740 compared to $146,809 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 as a result of increases in mining, and selling and general
and administrative expenses.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 The following table provides selected financial data about our
company as of September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2015, respectively.  
  Working Capital   
 
  Cash Flows   
 
 We had total current assets of $60,756 as of September 30, 2016
compared to $48,007 as of June 30, 2016. We had a working capital deficit of
$5,886,830 as of September 30, 2016 compared to a working capital deficit of
$2,473,600 as of June 30, 2016.  

The report of our auditors on our audited consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, contains a going
concern qualification as we have suffered losses since our inception. We have
minimal assets and have achieved no operating revenues since our inception. We
have depended on loans and sales of equity securities to conduct operations.
Unless and until we commence material operations and achieve material revenues,
we will remain dependent on financings to continue our operations.  
  Anticipated Cash Requirements   
 We estimate that our expenses over the next 12 months will be
approximately $650,000 as described in the table below. These estimates may
change significantly depending on the nature of our future business activities
and our ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources. 
 
 We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months
through the use of the cash we have on hand and through equity financing, debt
financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity
ownership of our shares. We currently do not have any other arrangements in
place to complete any private placement financings and there is no assurance
that we will be successful in completing any such financings on terms that will
be acceptable to us. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
stockholders.  
  Inflation   
 The amounts presented in our financial statements do not
provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The
net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of
inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that
represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments.  
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
  Basis of presentation and consolidation  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 
 These interim financial statements as of and for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited; however, in the opinion
of management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results
of operations and cash flows of our company for the periods presented. The
results for the three months ended September 30, 2015 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending June 30, 2017 or
for any future period. All references to September 30, 2016 and 2015 in these
footnotes are unaudited. 

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended June 30, 2016, included in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
October 18, 2016. 
 
 Principal of Consolidation  
 
The unaudited condensed financial statements include the accounts of our company, its wholly-owned subsidiary Alta Disposal Ltd., its 51% owned subsidiary Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. (formerly Bluetap Resources Ltd.), and its 100% interest in
Black Box Energy. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in conformity with the applicable accounting framework. Note that no transactions occurred within Black Box Energy. 
 
 Use of Estimates   
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our company s periodic
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of our company. Significant estimates
that may materially change in the near term include the valuation of derivative liabilities and the underlying warrants, as well as fair value of investments.  
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents   
 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with original maturities of less than three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of
management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. We had  39,839 and  25,208 in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  
 
 Concentration of Risk   
 
We maintain cash balances at a financial institution which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits for banks located in the US. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, our company had no deposits in
excess of federally insured limits in its US bank. Our company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash in bank accounts.  
 
 Prepaid expenses   
 
Prepaid expenses consist of security deposit for office lease which will be expensed or refunded at the end of the lease period. 
 
 Start-Up Costs   
 
In accordance with FASC 720-15-20  Start-Up Costs,  our company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of our company.  
 
 Mineral Acquisition and Exploration Costs   
 
Our company has been in the exploration stage since its formation on May 31, 2006. It is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of mining properties. Mineral property acquisition and exploration costs are expensed as
incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserves.  

Concentrations of Credit Risk   
 
Our company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents and related party payables it will likely incur in the near future. Our company places its cash and cash
equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. Our company s management plans to assess
the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.  
 
 Non-controlling Interest   
 
The 49% third party ownership of Alta Disposal Morinville Ltd. (formerly Blue Tap Resources Ltd.) at September 30, 2016 and 2015 are recorded as non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Details of changes in the
non-controlling interests during the year ended June 30, 2016 and period ending September 30, 2016 are reflected in the condensed statement of deficit.  
 
 Related Parties  
 
Parties are considered to be related to our company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with our company. Related parties also include principal owners
of our company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of our company and its management and other parties with which our company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or
operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. Our company discloses all related party transactions. All transactions shall be recorded at fair
value of the goods or services exchanged. Property purchased from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is reflected as a distribution to related
party. 
 
 Net Income or (Loss) per Share of Common Stock   
 
Our company has adopted FASC Topic No. 260,  Earnings Per Share,  ( EPS ) which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires
a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net
income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  
 
Potentially dilutive securities are not presented in the computation of EPS since their effects are anti-dilutive. The total number of potential no. of dilutive shares is 510,903,310 at the period ending September 30, 2016. 
 
 Foreign Currency Translations   
 
Our company s functional and reporting currency is the US dollar. All transactions initiated in other currencies are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the US dollar at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from such transactions are deferred until realization and are included as a
separate component of stockholders  equity (deficit) as a component of comprehensive income or loss. Upon realization, the amount deferred is recognized in income in the period when it is realized.  

Translation of Foreign Operations   
 
The financial results and position of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from our company s presentation currency are translated as follows: 
 
- assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates prevailing at that reporting date; 
 
- equity is translated at historical exchange rates; and 
 
- income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. 
 
Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations are transferred directly to our company s accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate
fluctuation on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the consolidated statements of operations.  
 
The relevant translation rates are as follows: For the period ending September 30, 2016 closing rate at 0.7624 CDN : US , average rate at 0.7665 CDN : US  and for the year ended June 30, 2016 closing rate at 0.769 CDN : US ,
average rate at 0.7761 CDN : US . For the period ending September 30, 2015 closing rate at 0.7466 CDN : US , average rate at 0.7637 CDN : US   
 
 Comprehensive Income (Loss)   
 
FASC Topic No. 220,  Comprehensive Income,  establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. As at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, our
company had no material items of other comprehensive income except for the foreign currency translation adjustment. 
 
  Risks and Uncertainties   
 
Our company operates in the resource exploration industry that is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological, and other risks associated with operating a resource exploration business, including
the potential risk of business failure.  
 
 Environmental Expenditures   
 
The operations of our company have been, and may in the future be, affected from time to time in varying degree by changes in environmental regulations, including those for future reclamation and site restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new
regulations and their overall effect upon our company vary greatly and are not predictable. Our company's policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation by application of technically proven and economically feasible
measures.  
 
Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending on their future economic benefits. All of these types of expenditures incurred
since inception have been charged against earnings due to the uncertainty of their future recoverability. Estimated future reclamation and site restoration costs, when the ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged against earnings
over the estimated remaining life of the related business operation, net of expected recoveries.  
 
 Warrants   
 
Our company accounts for currently outstanding detachable warrants to purchase common stock as derivative liabilities as they are freestanding derivative financial instruments. The warrants are recorded as derivative liabilities at fair value,
estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, and marked to market at each balance sheet date, with changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon exercise of a derivative financial instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the
conversion date and is reclassified to equity. 

Convertible Instruments   
 
Our company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging . It provide three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion
options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not
clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise
applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.
The result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative financial instrument and is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the
fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative financial instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at
the conversion date and is reclassified to equity.Our company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the
underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of notes
redemption.  
  Extinguishment of Debt  
 ASC 470-50-40,   Debt Modification and Extinguishments  ,  requires an entity for the refinancing and modification of the prior debt in a  non troubled debt situation to treat as either an extinguishment or a  modification based on whether the present value of the cash flows under the  terms of the new debt instrument is different by greater than, or less than,  10% from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the  original instrument. For cash flow changes greater than 10%, the debt  modification is accounted for as a debt extinguishment, whereby the original  debt is derecognized and the new debt is initially recorded at fair value, with  the difference recognized as an extinguishment gain or loss. 
 Upon  determination that debt should be extinguished in accordance with ASC 470-50, the  Convertible Promissory Notes and the respective derivative liability are  expensed as extinguishment of debt. The Warrants are extinguished in accordance  with ASC 815-10. 
 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 
ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the
level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:  
 
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
 
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and  
 
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing.  
 
The carrying amounts of our company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, deposit, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and due to a related party approximate their fair values because of
the short maturity of these instruments.  
 
Our company s Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the liability of our company s secured convertible promissory notes and debentures issued to investors, and the derivative warrants issued in connection with these convertible
promissory notes and debentures. There is no current market for these securities such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. Our company used a fair value model which incorporates transaction details such
as Company stock price, contractual terms, maturity, risk free rates, as well as assumptions about future financings, volatility, and holder behavior as of the date of issuance and each balance sheet date.  

Revenue Recognition   
 
Our company has generated little revenues to date. It is our company s policy that revenue from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with ASC 605  Revenue Recognition . Four basic criteria must be met before
revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on
management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. Our company will defer any revenue for which the product/services was not delivered or is subject to refund until such time that our company and the customer jointly determine that the
product/service has been delivered or no refund will be required.  
 
Sales comprise the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and rendering of services in the ordinary course of our company s activities. Sales are presented, net of tax, rebates and discounts, and after
eliminating intercompany sales. Our company recognizes revenue when the amount of revenue and related cost can be reliably measured and it is probable that the collectability of the related receivables is reasonably assured.  
 
During the year ended June 30, 2016 and period ending September 30, 2016, our company didn t record any revenue under continuing operation.  
 
 Income Taxes   
 
Our company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10,  Income Taxes  which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset
any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.  
 
Our company also follows the provisions of ASC 740-10 related to accounting for uncertain income tax positions. When tax returns are filed, some positions taken may be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others may be subject
to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the
period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are
not offset or aggregated with other positions. As of September 30, 2016, our company has had no uncertain tax positions. Our company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative
expenses. Our company currently has no federal or state tax examinations nor has it had any federal or state examinations since its inception. 
 
 Receivables   
 
Trade and other receivables are customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are recorded at face value less any provisions for uncollectible amounts considered necessary. Our company includes any balances that are determined to be
uncollectible in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts. Our company recorded  Nil (June 30, 2016 -  Nil) in allowance for doubtful accounts.  
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 
In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. ASU 2016-16 will require the tax
effects of intercompany transactions, other than sales of inventory, to be recognized currently, eliminating an exception under current GAAP in which the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers are deferred until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period
of our 2019 fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. 

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU
2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance regarding the classification of certain items within the statements of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. 
 
In connection with its financial instruments project, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments in June 2016 and ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments - Overall:
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities in January 2016. 

ASU 2016-13 introduces a new impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a forward-looking
 expected loss  model that will replace the current  incurred loss  model and generally will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2021
fiscal year, with early adoption in fiscal year 2020 permitted. 
 
ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other provisions, the new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in certain equity securities. For
investments without readily determinable fair values, entities have the option to either measure these investments at fair value or at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment. All changes in measurement will be recognized in
net income. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2019 fiscal year. Early adoption is not permitted, except for certain provisions relating to financial liabilities. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires, among other things, that entities measure equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of
the investee) at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Under the standard, entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale as a
component of other comprehensive income. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values the cost method of accounting is also eliminated, however subject to certain exceptions, entities will be able to elect to record equity
investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment and plus or minus adjustments for observable price changes, with all such changes recognized in earnings. This new standard does not change the guidance for classifying
and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. The standard is effective for us on July 1, 2018 (the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year). Our company is currently evaluating the anticipated impact of this standard on its consolidated
financial statements.  
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing
arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and
liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease
term. For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on
its consolidated financial statements.  
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) that clarifies how to apply revenue recognition guidance related to whether an
entity is a principal or an agent. ASU 2016-08 clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods or services before they are transferred to the customer and provides additional guidance about how to apply the control principle when services are provided and when goods or services are combined with other goods or services. The effective date for ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as
amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. Our company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-08 on its consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the
income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal
year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding
requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments
related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess
tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the
statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and
understandability of licensing implementation guidance. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within those years. Our company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 
FASB ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  was issued in June 2016 and clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion, presentation of taxes
collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract modifications at transition, completed contracts at transition and how guidance in Topic 606 is retrospectively applied. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in
Topic 606. The effective dates are the same as those for Topic 606.

As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.  
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
 
 Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president (our principal executive officer, principal financial
officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As of the end of the quarter covered by this report, we carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
president (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and

of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president
(our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal
accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Our
company is in the process of adopting specific internal control mechanisms with
our board and officers  collaboration to ensure effectiveness as we grow. We
have engaged an outside consultant to assist in adopting new measures to improve
upon our internal controls. Future controls, among other things, will include
more checks and balances and communication strategies between the management and
the board to ensure efficient and effective oversight over company activities as
well as more stringent accounting policies to track and update our financial
reporting.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.  
  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings

 LITHIUM EXPLORATION GROUP, INC.  8% CONVERTIBLE SECURED
REDEEMABLE NOTE  DUE October 19, 2017  
 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Lithium Exploration Group, Inc. (the
 Company ) promises to pay to the order of VES Investment Trust and its
authorized successors and permitted assigns (" Holder "), the aggregate
principal face amount of Thirty Five Thousand Dollars exactly (U.S. $35,000.00)
on October 19, 2017 (" Maturity Date ") and to pay interest on the
principal amount outstanding hereunder at the rate of 8% per annum commencing on
October 19, 2016. The interest will be paid to the Holder in whose name this
Note is registered on the records of the Company regarding registration and
transfers of this Note. The principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable
at _____________________________________________, initially, and if changed,
last appearing on the records of the Company as designated in writing by the
Holder hereof from time to time. The Company will pay each interest payment and
the outstanding principal due upon this Note before or on the Maturity Date,
less any amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of
this Note by check or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address
appearing on the records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire
transfer shall constitute a payment of outstanding principal hereunder and shall
satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of
the sum represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in
Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein.  
                  
This Note is subject to the following additional provisions:  
                  
1. This Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of
different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the
same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or
exchange, except that Holder shall pay any tax or other governmental charges payable in
connection therewith.  
 _____ Initials  

2. The Company shall be entitled to withhold from all payments any amounts
required to be withheld under applicable laws.  
                  
3. This Note may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (" Act ") and applicable state
securities laws. Any attempted transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be
treated by the Company as void. Prior to due presentment for transfer of this
Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the person in whose
name this Note is duly registered on the Company's records as the owner hereof
for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the
Company nor any such agent shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary.
Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of conversion set forth
in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section
4(a), and any prospective transferee of this Note, also is required to give the
Company written confirmation that this Note is being converted (" Notice of
Conversion ") in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of
receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be
the Conversion Date. 
                  
4. (a) The Holder of this Note is entitled, at its option, at any time after
cash payment, to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this
Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common
Stock") at a price (" Conversion Price ") for each share of Common Stock
equal to  65%  of the     lowest trading price   of the
Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTC Market exchange
which the Company s shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common
Stock may be traded in the future (" Exchange "), for the    ten
   prior   trading days including the day upon which a Notice of
Conversion is received by the Company or its transfer agent (provided such
Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax or other electronic method of
communication to the Company or its transfer agent after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard
or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing
price). If the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days, the Notice
of Conversion may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the
Company delivering the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business
days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued but unpaid
interest shall be subject to conversion. No fractional shares or scrip
representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the number of
shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share .  To the
extent the Conversion Price of the Company s Common Stock closes below the par
value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the
consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible
under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this
increase.  In the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares,
the conversion price shall be decreased to 55% instead of 65% while that  Chill 
is in effect.  In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion
if such conversion, along with all other shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company.    
                       
(b) Interest on any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the
rate of 8% per annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in Common Stock
("Interest Shares"). Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of
Conversion to the Company for Interest Shares based on the formula provided in
Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be
all or a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal
balance of this Note to the date of such notice.

(d) Upon (i) a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company
to any person in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (ii) a
reclassification, capital reorganization or other change or exchange of
outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a forward or reverse stock
split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving
entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction
of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or
exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common
Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a "Sale Event"),
then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this
Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest
through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder
may convert the unpaid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount
of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to
such Sale Event at the Conversion Price.  
                       
(e) In case of any Sale Event (not to include a sale of all or substantially all
of the Company s assets) in connection with which this Note is not redeemed or
converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the
Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to
purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number of shares of stock or
other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such
reclassification, capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or
merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could have been
purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined
in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions
shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the consideration received
by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or successor person or
entity acting in good faith.  
                  
5. No provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the
Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and
interest on, this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein
prescribed.  
                  
6. The Company hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for payment,
notice of non-payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of dishonor, notice of
acceleration or intent to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to
collect amounts called for hereunder and shall be directly and primarily liable
for the payment of all sums owing and to be owing hereto.

Then, or at any time thereafter, unless cured within 5 days, and in each and
every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been waived in writing
by the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent
default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole discretion, the
Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or (further) notice of any kind (other than notice of
acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything herein or in
any note or other instruments contained to the contrary notwithstanding, and the

breach of Section 8(m) occurs or is continuing after the 6 month anniversary of
the Note, then the Holder shall be entitled to use the lowest closing bid price
during the delinquency period as a base price for the conversion. For example,
if the lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period is $0.01 per share
and the conversion discount is 50% the Holder may elect to convert future
conversions at $0.005 per share. 
 If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses

fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the conversion shares by the by
the 3rd business day following the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the

payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from
the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  
                  
9. In case any provision of this Note is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable,
such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is
enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and the validity and enforceability
of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.  
                  
10. Neither this Note nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH
THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT
BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF

filed under the 1933 Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 or
Regulation S without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a
particular date that can then be immediately sold, or (b) such holder provides
the Company with an opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope customary
for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public
sale or transfer of such Security may be made without registration under the
1933 Act, which opinion shall be accepted by the Company so that the sale or
transfer is effected. The Buyer agrees to sell all Securities, including those
represented by a certificate(s) from which the legend has been removed, in
compliance with applicable prospectus delivery requirements, if any. In the

1933, AS AMENDED, AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER (THE
"1933 ACT )   
 FOR VALUE RECEIVED  Lithium Exploration Group, Inc.  (the
 Company ) promises to pay to the order of  Concord Holding Group, LLC ,
and its authorized successors and permitted assigns (" Holder "), the
aggregate principal face amount of One Hundred Sixty Three Thousand Three
Hundred and Thirty Four dollars exactly (U.S. $163,334.00) on October 31, 2017
(" Maturity Date "). The Company will pay interest on the principal amount
outstanding at the rate of 10% per annum, which will commence on October 31,
2016. The Company acknowledges that this Note was issued with a $16,334.00
original issue discount ( OID ) such that the issuance price was $147,000.00.
The interest will be paid to the Holder in whose name this Note is registered on
the records of the Company regarding registration and transfers of this Note.
The principal of, and interest on, this Note are payable at 1080 Bergen St.,
Suite 240, Brooklyn, NY 11216, initially, and if changed, last appearing on the
records of the Company as designated in writing by the Holder hereof from time
to time. The Company will pay each interest payment and the outstanding
principal due upon this Note before or on the Maturity Date, less any amounts
required by law to be deducted or withheld, to the Holder of this Note by check
or wire transfer addressed to such Holder at the last address appearing on the
records of the Company. The forwarding of such check or wire transfer shall
constitute a payment of outstanding principal hereunder and shall satisfy and
discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of the sum
represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in Common
Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein.  
           This
Note is subject to the following additional provisions: 
           1.
This Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of
different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the
same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or
exchange, except that Holder shall pay any tax or other governmental charges
payable in connection therewith.  

2.
Under all applicable laws, the Company shall be entitled to withhold any amounts
from all payments it is entitled to.  
           3.
This Note may only be transferred or exchanged in compliance with the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (" Act ") and any applicable state securities laws.
All attempts transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company
as void. Prior to due presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company and any
agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly
registered on the Company's records as the owner hereof for all other purposes,
whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent
shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note
electing to exercise the right of conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof,
in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prospective
transferee of this Note, also is required to give the Company written
confirmation that this Note is being converted (" Notice of Conversion ")
in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A . The date of receipt (including
receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion
Date. 
           4.
(a) The Holder of this Note has the option, upon the issuance date of the stock,
to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then
outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock (the " Common
Stock ") at a price (" Conversion Price ") for each share of Common
Stock equal to the lesser of $0.005 or 50% discount of the   lowest trading
price     of the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations
Bureau OTC Markets exchange which the Company s shares are traded or any
exchange upon which the Common Stock may be traded in the future
(" Exchange "), for the (i)    twenty      prior 
 trading days, including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is
received by the Company (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax
or other electronic method of communication to the Company after 4 P.M. Eastern
Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day
closing price), or (ii)    twenty    trading days prior to
October 31, 2016. The Notice of Conversion may be rescinded if the shares have
not been delivered within 3 business days. The Company shall deliver the shares
of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company
of the Notice of Conversion. The Holder shall surrender this Note to the Company
upon receipt of the shares of Common Stock, executed by the Holder. This will
make clear the Holder's intention to convert this Note or a specified portion
hereof, and accompanied by proper assignment hereof in blank. Accrued but unpaid
interest shall be subject to conversion. The number of issuable shares will be
rounded to the nearest whole share, and no fractional shares or scrip
representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion. To the extent the
Conversion Price of the Company s Common Stock closes below the par value per
share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the
stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The
Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase . In
the event the Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares, the conversion
price discount   shall be increased to 60% while that  Chill  is in effect.   

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Note (except as
set forth below in this Section), the Note shall not be convertible by Investor,
and Company shall not effect any conversion of the Note or otherwise issue any
shares of Common Stock to the extent (but only to the extent) that Investor
together with any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 9.99%
(the   Maximum Percentage  ) of the Common Stock outstanding. To the extent
the foregoing limitation applies, the determination of whether a Note shall be
convertible (vis- -vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities
owned by Investor or any of its affiliates) and of which such securities shall
be convertible, exercisable or exchangeable (as among all such securities owned
by Investor and its affiliates) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage
limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to Company for
conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be). No prior inability to
convert a Note, or to issue shares of Common Stock, pursuant to this Section
shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this Section
with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility. For purposes of
this Section, beneficial ownership and all determinations and calculations
(including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage
ownership) shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(e) of the 1934 Act
(as defined below) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
provisions of this Section shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section to correct this Section (or any
portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Maximum
Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes
or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum
Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this Section shall apply to
a successor holder of this Note and shall be unconditional, irrevocable and
non-waivable. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of
Investor, Company shall within one (1) business day confirm orally and in
writing to Investor the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding,
including by virtue of any prior conversion or exercise of convertible or
exercisable securities into Common Stock, including, without limitation,
pursuant to this Note. During the first six months, this Note is in effect, the
Investor may not convert this Note pursuant to this paragraph. The conversion
discount and look-back period will be adjusted downward (i.e. for the benefit of
the Holder) if the Company offers a more favorable conversion discount (whether
via interest rate, OID, lower ceiling price or otherwise) or look-back period to
another party while this note is in effect and the Holder will also get the
benefit of any other term (for a example a higher prepay) granted to any third
party while this Note is in effect.  
                     (b)
Interest on any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate
of 10% per annum. Interest shall be paid, by the Company, in Common Stock
("Interest Shares"). Holder may send in a Notice of Conversion to the Company
for Interest Shares based on the formula provided in Section 4(a) above. The
dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be all or a portion of the
accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal balance of this Note to the
date of such notice. 
                     (c)
This Note may not be prepaid.  

(d)
Upon (i) a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to
any person in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (ii) a
reclassification, capital reorganization or other change or exchange of
outstanding shares of the Common Stock, other than a forward or reverse stock
split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving
entity (other than a merger which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction
of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or
exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common
Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a "Sale Event"),
then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this
Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest
through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder
may convert the unpaid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount
of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to
such Sale Event at the Conversion Price.  
                     (e)
In case of any Sale Event (not to include a sale of all or substantially all of
the Company s assets) in connection with which this Note is not redeemed or
converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the
Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to
purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number of shares of stock or
other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such
reclassification, capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or
merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could have been
purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined
in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions
shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the consideration received
by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company or successor person or
entity acting in good faith.  
           5.
No provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company,
which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on,
this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed.  
           6.
The Company hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for payment, notice
of non-payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of dishonor, notice of
acceleration or intent to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to
collect amounts called for hereunder and shall be directly and primarily liable
for the payment of all sums owing and to be owing hereto.  
           7.
The Company agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred by the Holder in collecting
any amount due under this Note.  
           8.
While this Note is outstanding and to the extent the Company grants any other
party more favorable investment terms (whether via interest rate, original issue
discount, conversion discount or look-back period), the terms
of the Note shall automatically adjust to match those more favorable terms.  

9.

                     (a)
The Company shall default in the payment of principal or interest on this Note
or any other note issued to the Holder by the Company; or 
                     (b)

certificate or financial or other written statements heretofore or hereafter
furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the execution and

note was issued shall be false or misleading in any respect; or 
                     (c)
The Company shall fail to perform or observe, in any respect, any covenant,

substantial part of its property or business without its consent and shall not

                     (f)
Any governmental agency or any court of competent jurisdiction at the instance

substantial portion of the properties or assets of the Company; or 
                     (g)

unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of fifteen (15) days or in any
event later than five (5) days prior to the date of any proposed sale
thereunder; or 
                     (h)
The Company shall have defaulted on or breached any term of any other note of
similar debt instrument into which the Company has entered and failed to cure such default within the appropriate grace period; or 

(i)
The Company shall have its Common Stock delisted from an exchange (including the

                     (j)
If a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company on the

                     (k)
The Company shall not deliver to the Holder the Common Stock pursuant to

conversion discount shall be increased from 50% to 60%.  
                     (p)
A default has been declared against the Company, which has not been cured in any
other loan or Note agreement.  
 Then, or at any time thereafter, unless cured within 5 days,
and in each and every such case, unless such Event of Default shall have been
waived in writing by the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's sole
discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or (further) notice of any kind (other than
notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything
herein or in any note or other instruments contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any

default, once cured, will be considered a default going forward.  

If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses
incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
proceeding. 
 At the Holder s election, if the Company fails for any reason
to deliver to the Holder the conversion shares by the 3rd business day following
the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs a
Failure to Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company
written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the
Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as
follows: 
 Failure to Deliver Loss = [(High trade
price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of conversion
shares)] 
 The Company must pay the Failure to Deliver Loss by cash
payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from
the time of the Holder s written notice to the Company.  
           10.
In case any provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, such provision
shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to
the maximum extent possible, and the validity and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.  
           11.
Neither this Note nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, discharged or
terminated other than by a written instrument signed by the Company and the
Holder.  
           12.
The Company represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and has never been a
 shell  issuer or that if it previously has been a  shell  issuer that at least
12 months have passed since the Company has reported form 10 type information
indicating it is no longer a  shell issuer. Further. The Company will instruct
its counsel to either (i) write a 144- 3(a)(9) opinion to allow for salability
of the conversion shares or (ii) accept such opinion from Holder s counsel.  
           13.
The Company shall reserve 130,000,000 shares of Common Stock for conversions
under this Note (the  Share Reserve ). The investor shall have the right to
periodically request that the number of Reserved Shares be
increased so that the number of Reserved Shares at least equals 400%   of
the number of shares of Company common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Note. The Company shall pay all costs associated with issuing and delivering the
shares. At all times, the reserve shall be maintained with the Transfer Agent at
four times the amount of shares required if the Note would be fully converted.
If the Company defaults on these terms, the conversion discount will increase to
60%.  

14.
The Company will give the Holder direct notice of any corporate actions,
including but not limited to name changes, stock splits, recapitalizations etc.
This notice shall be given to the Holder as soon as possible under law. 
           15.
This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New
York applicable to contracts made and wholly to be performed within the State of
New York and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each party
hereto. The Holder and the Company hereby mutually waive trial by jury and
consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of New
York. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and the facsimile
transmission of an executed counterpart to this Agreement shall be effective as
an original.  
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Note to be duly
executed by an officer thereunto duly authorized.

 I, Alexander Walsh, certify that:  

1.  
     
       I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of
      Lithium Exploration Group, Inc.;   

2.  
     
       Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any
      untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
      necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
      which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
      covered by this report;   

3.  
     
       Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and
      other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
      material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
      flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
      report;   

4.  
     
       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are
      responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
      procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and
      internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
      Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and
  have:     

(a)  
     
       Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or
      caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
      supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
      registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
      by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which
      this report is being prepared;   

(b)  
     
       Designed such internal control over financial reporting,
      or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
      under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
      reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
      statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles;   

(c)  
     
       Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's
      disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our
      conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
      procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
      such evaluation; and   

(d)  
     
       Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
      internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
      registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal
      quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or
      is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
      control over financial reporting; and     

5.  
     
       The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have
      disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
      financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee
      of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
      equivalent functions):   

(a)  
     
       All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
      the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
      are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
      record, process, summarize and report financial information; and   

(b)  
     
       Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
      management or other employees who have a significant role in the
      registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.
