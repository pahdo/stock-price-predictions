VALERO ENERGY PARTNERS LP 
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. 
    BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
     Business 
  Valero Energy Partners LP (the Partnership) is a fee-based, master limited partnership formed by Valero (defined below) in July 2013 to own, operate, develop, and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products pipelines, terminals, and other transportation and logistics assets. 
  References in this report to  Partnership,   we,   us,  or  our  refer to Valero Energy Partners LP, one or more of its subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. References in this report to  Valero  refer collectively to Valero Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries, other than Valero Energy Partners LP, any of its subsidiaries, or its general partner. 
  We acquired from Valero the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business on   March 1, 2015  , the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business on   October 1, 2015  , the McKee Terminal Services Business on   April 1, 2016  , and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business on   September 1, 2016  . See   Note 3   for further discussion of these acquisitions from Valero.  
  Our assets consist of crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline and terminal systems in the United States (U.S.) Gulf Coast and U.S. Mid-Continent regions that are integral to the operations of   ten   of Valero s refineries. 
  We generate operating revenues by providing fee-based transportation and terminaling services to Valero.  
  Basis of Presentation 
  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership as well as our Predecessor (defined below). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
  The acquisitions from Valero were accounted for as transfers of businesses between entities under the common control of Valero. As entities under the common control of Valero, we recorded these acquisitions on our balance sheet at Valero s carrying value rather than fair value. Transfers between entities under common control are accounted for as though the transfer occurred as of the beginning of the period of transfer, and prior period financial statements and financial information are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Accordingly, the Partnership s financial statements and related notes have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the acquisitions from Valero for all periods presented prior to the effective dates of each acquisition. We refer to the historical results of the acquisitions from Valero prior to their respective acquisition dates as those of our  Predecessor.  
  The combined financial statements of our Predecessor were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Valero and reflect the combined historical financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of our Predecessor as if the acquisitions from Valero had been combined for periods prior to the effective dates of each acquisition.  
  There were no transactions between the operations of our Predecessor; therefore, there were no intercompany transactions or accounts to be eliminated in connection with the combination of those operations. In addition, our Predecessor s statements of income include direct charges for the management and operation of our assets and certain expenses allocated by Valero for general corporate services, such as treasury, accounting,

     Table of Contents  

VALERO ENERGY PARTNERS LP 
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

and legal services. These expenses were charged, or allocated, to our Predecessor based on the nature of the expenses. Prior to the acquisitions from Valero, our Predecessor transferred cash to Valero daily and Valero funded our Predecessor s operating and investing activities as needed. Therefore, transfers of cash to and from Valero s cash management system are reflected as a component of net investment and are reflected as a financing activity in our statements of cash flows. In addition, interest expense was not included on the net cash transfers from Valero.  
  The financial information presented for the periods after the effective dates of the acquisitions from Valero represents the consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Partnership. 
  These unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. Financial information for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   included in these Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is derived from our unaudited financial statements. Operating results for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These unaudited financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Partnership included in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 4, 2016, which reflect retrospective adjustments to the Partnership s 2015 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016 for the historical results of operations and financial position of the McKee Terminal Services Business. 
   
           2. 
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
     Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. 
  Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Period 
  In April 2015, the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 835-30,  Interest Imputation of Interest,  were amended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a note be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of that note, consistent with debt discounts, and that amortization of debt issuance costs be reported as interest expense. In August 2015, these provisions were further amended with guidance from the SEC staff, which provides that the staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. These provisions were effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2016 did not affect our financial position or results of operations as our debt  

6 

     Table of Contents  

VALERO ENERGY PARTNERS LP 
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

issuance costs are associated with our revolving credit facility and therefore were not required to be reclassified.  
  Also in April 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 260,  Earnings Per Share,  were amended to provide guidance on how master limited partnerships apply the two-class method of calculating earnings per unit for historical periods when they receive net assets in a dropdown transaction that is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as required under Subtopic 805-50,  Business Combinations Related Issues.  The amendments specify that for purposes of calculating earnings per unit under the two-class method for periods before the date of a dropdown transaction, earnings or losses of a transferred business should be allocated entirely to the general partner. Qualitative disclosures are also required to describe how the rights to earnings or losses differ before and after the dropdown transaction for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method. These provisions were effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. We have historically calculated our net income per unit after a dropdown transaction as prescribed by these provisions; therefore, the adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2016 did not affect our financial position or results of operations, but resulted in additional disclosures as shown in   Note 9  .  
  In November 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes,  were amended to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The amendments are effective for financial statements for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual period. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted this guidance on a retrospective basis, but such adoption did not affect our financial position as we had no current deferred tax amounts to reclassify.  
  Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the ASC was amended and a new accounting standard, ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  was issued to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods. We have been evaluating and continue to evaluate the provisions of this standard and its impact on our business processes, business and accounting systems, and financial statements and related disclosures. A multi-disciplined implementation team has gained an understanding of the standard s revenue recognition model, is completing the review and documentation of our commercial agreements with Valero, and is analyzing whether enhancements are needed to our business and accounting systems. 
  In January 2016, the provisions of ASC Subtopic 825-10,  Financial Instruments Overall,  were amended to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments regarding certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure. These provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this standard will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the ASC was amended and a new accounting standard, ASC Topic 842,  Leases,  was issued to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We have been evaluating and continue

to evaluate the provisions of this standard and its impact on our business processes, business and accounting systems, and financial statements and related disclosures. A multi-disciplined implementation team has gained an understanding of the accounting and disclosure provisions of the standard and is in the process of analyzing the impacts to our business and accounting systems, including the development of new accounting systems to account for our leases and support the required disclosures.

    RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
     Agreements Effective with the Acquisitions in 2016 
  The following agreements became effective with our acquisitions of the McKee Terminal Services Business and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business, coinciding with the effective dates of each acquisition. 
  Commercial Agreements 
  We entered into additional schedules under our existing master terminal services agreement with respect to the McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers terminals. The McKee terminal schedule has an initial term through   April 1, 2026   and the Meraux and Three Rivers terminal schedules have initial terms through   September 1, 2026  . Each schedule provides Valero an option to renew for   one   additional   five  -year term and contains minimum throughput requirements and inflation escalators. 
  Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement 
  We entered into amended and restated schedules to our amended and restated omnibus agreement with Valero that include the following modifications, among others: 
             
    the indemnification obligations of Valero and the Partnership were extended to apply to the McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers terminals; 
                
    the administrative fee was increased from   $11.2 million   to   $11.7 million   per year in connection with the acquisition of the McKee Terminal Services Business in April 2016. The fee was increased again in September 2016 to   $12.5 million   per year in connection with the acquisition of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business. Each increase in 2016 will be prorated based on the number of days from the effective dates of each acquisition to December 31, 2016; and 
                
    the grant to Valero of a right of first refusal with respect to the McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers terminals. 
     Amended and Restated Services and Secondment Agreement 
  Our general partner entered into amended and restated exhibits to the amended and restated services and secondment agreement with Valero to provide for the additional secondment of employees to our general partner for the provision of services with respect to the McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers terminals. 
  Lease and Access Agreements 
  We entered into a lease and access agreement with Valero with respect to the land on which the McKee terminal is located. This agreement has an initial term through   April 1, 2026   with   four   automatic successive renewal periods of   five   years each. Either party may terminate the lease after the initial term by providing written notice. Initially, our base rent is   $594,000   per year and is subject to an annual inflation escalator. We are also required to pay Valero a customary expense reimbursement for taxes, utilities, and similar costs incurred by Valero related to the leased premises.

VALERO ENERGY PARTNERS LP 
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

We entered into   two   lease and access agreements with Valero with respect to the land on which the Meraux and Three Rivers terminals are located. Each agreement has an initial term through   September 1, 2026   with   four   automatic successive renewal periods of   five   years each. Either party may terminate each agreement after the initial term by providing written notice. Initially, our base rent under the Meraux and Three Rivers terminal agreements totals   $971,000   per year and each agreement is subject to annual inflation escalators. We are also required to pay Valero a customary expense reimbursement for taxes, utilities, and similar costs incurred by Valero related to the leased premises. 
  Summary of Transactions 
  Receivables from related party consist of the following (in thousands): 

The amounts shown in our balance sheets as  deferred revenue from related party  represent the unearned revenues from Valero associated with Valero s quarterly deficiency payment, which is the result of Valero not meeting its minimum quarterly throughput commitments under certain schedules of our master transportation services agreement and master terminal services agreement (collectively, the commercial agreements). 
  All of our operating revenues are generated by providing services to Valero under our commercial agreements with Valero. The cost of services provided to us by Valero, including the cost of financing provided to us by Valero in connection with certain acquisitions from Valero as more fully described in Notes   3   and   6  , are reflected in the supplemental information disclosure on our statements of income. 
  Concentration Risk 
  All of our operating revenues were derived from transactions with Valero and all of the receivables from related party were due from Valero. Therefore, we are subject to the business risks associated with Valero s business. 
  Leases 
  Certain schedules under our commercial agreements with Valero are considered operating leases under U.S. GAAP. These agreements contain minimum throughput requirements and escalation clauses to adjust transportation tariffs and terminaling and storage fees to reflect changes in price indices. Revenues from all of our commercial agreements with Valero that are considered operating leases are recorded within  operating revenues   related party  in our statements of income.

Revolving Credit Facility 
  We have a   $750.0 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the Revolver) that matures in   November 2020  . We have the option to increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolver to   $1.0 billion  , subject to certain restrictions. The Revolver also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to   $100.0 million  . Our obligations under the Revolver are jointly and severally guaranteed by our directly owned subsidiary, Valero Partners Operating Co. LLC. Borrowings on the Revolver bear interest at a variable rate, which was   1.81   percent as of   September 30, 2016  . Accrued interest is payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Revolver) and on the maturity date. 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we borrowed   $139.0 million   and   $210.0 million   under the Revolver in connection with the acquisitions of the McKee Terminal Services Business and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we borrowed   $200.0 million   under the Revolver in connection with the acquisition of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business. See   Note 3   for information about our acquisitions from Valero. 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we made no repayments under the Revolver. During the nine months ended September 30,   2015  , we repaid   $25.0 million   under the Revolver. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $524.0 million   of borrowings outstanding and   no   letters of credit outstanding under the Revolver. As of   December 31, 2015  , we had   $175.0 million   of borrowings outstanding and   no   letters of credit outstanding under the Revolver.  
  Subordinated Credit Agreements 
  During   2015  , we entered into   two   subordinated credit agreements with Valero (the Loan Agreements), under which we borrowed   $160.0 million   and   $395.0 million   (collectively, the loans) to finance a portion of the acquisitions of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business and the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business, respectively, as described in   Note 3  . The loans mature on   March 1   and   October 1, 2020  , respectively, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty. We are not permitted to reborrow amounts. The loans bear interest at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreements) plus the applicable margin. Accrued interest is payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Loan Agreements) and on each maturity date. As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on each of the loans was   1.77   percent. 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we made no repayments under the loans. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $370.0 million   outstanding under the Loan Agreements. 
  Capitalized Interest 
  Capitalized interest was   $13,000   and   $6,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $48,000   and   $12,000   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

    OPERATING LEASES 
     We have long-term operating lease commitments primarily with Valero for land used in the terminaling and transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Certain leases contain escalation clauses and renewal options that allow for the same rental payment over the lease term or a revised rental payment based on fair rental value or negotiated value. Currently, one of our land leases with Valero does not contain a renewal option. We expect that, in the normal course of business, our leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our future minimum rentals for leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): 

Rental expense for all operating leases was   $2.5 million   and   $1.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $7.1 million   and   $4.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. Rental expense for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   has been retrospectively adjusted for the acquisitions of the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business, the McKee Terminal Services Business, and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business.

    CASH DISTRIBUTIONS  
     Our partnership agreement prescribes the amount and priority of cash distributions that our limited partners and general partner will receive. Our distributions are declared subsequent to quarter end. The table below summarizes information related to our quarterly cash distributions that have been declared since January 1, 2015: 

The following table reflects the allocation of total cash distributions to the general and limited partners and distribution equivalent right (DER) payments applicable to the period in which the distributions and DERs were earned (in thousands):

    NET INCOME PER LIMITED PARTNER UNIT 
     Distributions to our unitholders are determined in relation to actual distributions declared and are not based on the net income allocations used in the calculation of net income per limited partner unit.  
  We calculate net income available to limited partners based on the distributions pertaining to each period s net income. After considering the appropriate period s distributions, the remaining undistributed earnings or excess distributions over earnings, if any, are allocated to the general partner, limited partners, and other participating securities in accordance with the contractual terms of our partnership agreement and as prescribed under the two-class method. Participating securities include IDRs and awards under our Valero Energy Partners LP 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan (2013 ICP) that receive DERs. However, the terms of our partnership agreement limit the general partner s incentive distribution to the amount of available cash, which, as defined in our partnership agreement, is net of reserves deemed appropriate. As such, IDRs are not allocated undistributed earnings or distributions in excess of earnings in the calculation of net income per limited partner unit. 
  Net losses of our Predecessor are allocated to the general partner. Subsequent to the effective dates of the acquisitions from Valero, we calculate net income available to limited partners based on the methodology described above. 
  Basic net income per limited partner unit is determined pursuant to the two-class method for master limited partnerships. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that is used to determine earnings to our general partner, common unitholders, and participating securities according to (i) distributions pertaining to each period s net income and (ii) participation rights in undistributed earnings. 
  Diluted net income per limited partner unit is also determined using the two-class method, unless the treasury stock method is more dilutive. For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we used the two-class method to determine diluted net income per limited partner unit. We did not have any potentially dilutive instruments outstanding during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Effective   August 10, 2016  , all of our subordinated units, which were owned by Valero, were converted on a one-for-one basis into common units. The subordinated units were only allocated earnings generated by us through the conversion date. See   Note 10   for further discussion of the conversion of subordinated units.

Subordinated Unit Conversion 
  The requirements under our partnership agreement for the conversion of all of our outstanding subordinated units into common units were satisfied upon the payment of our quarterly cash distribution on   August 9, 2016  . Therefore, effective   August 10, 2016  , all of our subordinated units, which were owned by Valero, were converted on a one-for-one basis into common units. The conversion of the subordinated units does not impact the amount of cash distributions paid or the total number of outstanding units. 
  ATM Program 
  On   September 16, 2016  , we filed a prospectus supplement to our shelf registration statement (which was declared effective on   September 1, 2016  ) and entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time our common units having an aggregate offering price of up to   $350.0 million   based on amounts and terms agreed to by us and at prices determined  at the market  at the time of sale (our ATM Program). During September 2016, we issued   65,980   common units under our ATM Program and received proceeds of   $2.8 million   (net of   $39,000   of compensation paid with respect to the sales of these units).

VALERO ENERGY PARTNERS LP 
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

In October 2016, we issued   78,805   units that were sold in late September 2016. As a result, we had a receivable for   $3.4 million   (net of   $34,000   of compensation paid with respect to the sales of these units) as of   September 30, 2016   for which the cash was received by October 5, 2016.  
  Concurrent with the issuance of common units under our ATM Program, we issued   1,346   general partner units to our general partner on   September 30, 2016   for   $58,000   in order to maintain its   2.0   percent general partner interest in the Partnership. 
  Transfers to (from) Partners 
  Subsequent to the expiration of the subordination period on August 10, 2016, all of our common units have equal rights, including rights to distributions and to our net assets in the event of liquidation. As a result, a reallocation of the carrying values of our public common unitholders  interest in us and Valero s common unitholder interest in us is required when a change in ownership occurs in order for the portion of those carrying values associated with activity subsequent to the subordination period to be equal to the respective unitholders  ownership interests (in units) in us. The transactions that resulted in transfers to (from) partners include the issuance of equity to Valero in connection with our acquisition of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business on   September 1, 2016   and the issuance of equity under our ATM Program in September 2016. 
  Unit Activity

    SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION 
     In order to determine net cash provided by operating activities, net income is adjusted by, among other things, changes in current assets and current liabilities as follows (in thousands): 

The above changes in current assets and current liabilities differ from changes between amounts reflected in the applicable balance sheets for the respective periods for the following reasons: 
             
    amounts accrued for capital expenditures are reflected in investing activities when such amounts are paid; and 
                
    amounts accrued for offering costs and debt issuance costs are reflected in financing activities when paid. 
     During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we attributed   $51.4 million   of the total   $204.0 million   cash consideration paid for the acquisition of the McKee Terminal Services Business to the historical carrying value of this acquisition (an investing cash outflow). The remaining   $152.6 million   of the cash consideration represents the excess purchase price paid over the carrying value of this acquisition (a financing cash outflow).  
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we attributed   $52.2 million   of the total   $276.0 million   cash consideration paid for the acquisition of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business to the historical carrying value of this acquisition (an investing cash outflow). The remaining   $223.8 million   of the cash consideration represents the excess purchase price paid over the carrying value of this acquisition (a financing cash outflow). 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , we attributed   $296.1 million   of the total   $571.2 million   cash consideration paid for the acquisition of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business to the historical carrying value of this acquisition (an investing cash outflow). The remaining   $275.1 million   of cash consideration represents the excess purchase price paid over the carrying value of this acquisition (a financing cash outflow).

    the issuance of   728,775   common units and   14,873   general partner units having an aggregate value of   $36.0 million   in connection with the acquisition of the McKee Terminal Services Business described in   Note 3  ;  
                
    the issuance of   1,149,905   common units and   23,467   general partner units having an aggregate value of   $49.0 million   in connection with the acquisition of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business described in   Note 3  ; 
                
    the conversion of all of our outstanding subordinated units into common units having an aggregate value of   $406.4 million   described in   Note 10  ; and 
                
    the transfers to (from) partners reflect the impact of ownership changes occurring as a result of the issuance of common units (i) to Valero for the acquisition of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business and (ii) under our ATM Program, described in   Note 10  . 
     Noncash investing and financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   included: 
             
    a capital contribution of   $14.5 million   for projects that were funded by Valero related primarily to the Houston and St. Charles terminals. Valero agreed to fund these projects as part of the acquisition of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business; and 
                
    the issuance of   1,908,100   common units and   38,941   general partner units having an aggregate value of   $100.0 million   in connection with the acquisition of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business described in   Note 3  .

    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
     The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value due to the low level of credit risk of these assets combined with their market interest rates. The fair value measurement for cash and cash equivalents is categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 
  The fair values of our debt and notes payable to related party approximate their carrying values as our borrowings bear interest based upon short-term floating market interest rates. The fair value measurement for these liabilities is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values determined by Level 2 utilize inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

  OVERVIEW 
  We are a fee-based master limited partnership that owns and operates crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline and terminal systems in the U.S. Gulf Coast and U.S. Mid-Continent regions that are integral to the operations of ten of Valero s refineries. Since our formation in 2013, we have acquired several businesses from Valero and began receiving fees for services provided by those businesses commencing on each respective acquisition date. The following businesses were acquired from Valero in 2015 and 2016 and are further described in Note   3   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: 
             
    On March 1, 2015, we acquired the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business for total consideration of   $671.2 million  .  
                
    On October 1, 2015, we acquired the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business for total consideration of   $465.0 million  .  
                 
    On September 1, 2016, we acquired the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business for total consideration of   $325.0 million  . 
     The acquisitions from Valero were accounted for as transfers of businesses between entities under the common control of Valero. Accordingly, the Partnership s financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the acquired businesses for all periods presented prior to the effective date of each acquisition. We refer to the historical results of the acquired businesses prior to their respective  

31 

     Table of Contents  

acquisition dates as those of our  Predecessor.  See Notes   1   and   3   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the basis of this presentation.  
  In connection with the acquisitions from Valero, we entered into commercial agreements with Valero and began recognizing terminaling revenues. We had not charged fees for services provided to Valero prior to each acquisition; therefore, our results of operations subsequent to the acquisitions are not comparable to our historical results of operations. 
  For the   third quarter   of   2016  , we reported net income of   $48.7 million   and net income attributable to partners of   $51.7 million  . This compares to net income of   $15.6 million   and net income attributable to partners of   $31.4 million   for the   third quarter   of   2015  .  
             
    The increase in net income of   $33.1 million   in the   third quarter   of 2016 compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   was due primarily to $33.1 million of revenues generated by our Corpus Christi, McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers terminals in the   third quarter   of 2016. As previously noted, the   Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business  , the   McKee Terminal Services Business  , and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business did not charge Valero for services provided prior to our acquisition of those businesses. 
                
    Net income attributable to partners represents our results of operations and only includes the results of an acquired business for the period subsequent to the effective date of its acquisition. Therefore, the increase in net income attributable to partners of   $20.3 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   was due primarily to the comparable periods reflecting the results of operations of the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business, the   McKee Terminal Services Business  , and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business from the date of their respective acquisition. 
     For the   first nine months   of   2016  , we reported net income of   $129.0 million   and net income attributable to partners of   $144.5 million  . This compares to net income of   $34.5 million   and net income attributable to partners of   $87.2 million   for the   first nine months   of   2015  .  
             
    The increase in net income of   $94.5 million   in the   first nine months   of 2016 compared to the   first nine months   of   2015   was due primarily to higher revenues of $99.1 million generated by our  Houston, St. Charles, Corpus Christi, McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers terminals. As previously noted, the   Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business  , the   Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business  , the   McKee Terminal Services Business  , and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business did not charge Valero for services provided prior to our acquisition of those businesses. 
                
    Net income attributable to partners represents our results of operations and only includes the results of an acquired business for the period subsequent to the effective date of its acquisition. Therefore, the increase in net income attributable to partners of   $57.2 million   in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the   first nine months   of   2015   was due primarily to the comparable periods reflecting the results of operations of the   Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business  , the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business, the   McKee Terminal Services Business  , and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business from the date of their respective acquisition. 
     Additional analysis of the changes in the components of net income is provided below under  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUTLOOK 
  Because our operating revenues are generated from fee-based arrangements with Valero, the amount of operating revenues we generate primarily depends on the volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum products that we transport through our pipelines and handle at our terminals. These volumes are primarily affected by refinery reliability and the supply of, and demand for, crude oil and refined petroleum products in the markets served by our assets. For 2016, we expect that Valero will transport volumes through our pipelines and throughput volumes at our terminals generally consistent with historical levels.

Operating revenues   increased     $30.0 million  , or   48 percent  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  . The   increase   was due to higher revenues of $33.1 million generated by our Corpus Christi, McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers terminals in the   third quarter   of 2016 compared to the   third quarter   of 2015. Prior to being acquired by us, the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business, the   McKee Terminal Services Business  , and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business did not charge Valero for services provided and, therefore, did not generate revenues. Effective with the acquisition dates, we entered into additional schedules to our commercial agreements with Valero with respect to the services we provide to Valero using the assets of the acquired businesses and began generating revenues with respect to these assets. 
  Operating expenses   decreased     $3.4 million  , or   12 percent  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   due primarily to lower maintenance expense of $2.3 million related to inspection activity and lower waste handling costs of $449,000 at the Corpus Christi terminals.  
  General and administrative expenses   increased     $363,000  , or   10 percent  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   due primarily to incremental costs of $221,000 related to the management fee charged to us by Valero related to our acquisitions of the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business, the   McKee Terminal Services Business  , and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business. 
  Depreciation expense   decreased     $2.4 million  , or   18 percent  , in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   due primarily to $2.8 million in accelerated depreciation related to the retirement of certain assets of the McKee Crude System in the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense on assets placed into service in the latter part of 2015 and the beginning of 2016, including expansion and improvement projects at our Houston and Meraux terminals. 
   Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest    increased     $2.3 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   due primarily to interest expense incurred on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and under the subordinated credit agreements with Valero entered into in connection with the acquisitions. Interest expense on these incremental borrowings was approximately $1.9 million in the   third quarter   of   2016  . 
  Our income tax expense is associated with the Texas margin tax. The relative amount of revenue we generate in Texas increased in connection with the acquisitions of the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business, the McKee Terminal Services Business, and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. As a result, our income tax expense has increased.

Operating revenues   increased     $94.3 million  , or   57 percent  , for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . The   increase   was due primarily to higher revenues of $99.1 million generated by our Houston, St. Charles, Corpus Christi, McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers terminals. Prior to being acquired by us, the   Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business  , the   Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business  , the   McKee Terminal Services Business  , and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business did not charge Valero for services provided and, therefore, did not generate revenues. Effective with the acquisition dates, we entered into additional schedules to our commercial agreements with Valero with respect to the services we provide to Valero using the assets of the acquired businesses and began generating revenues with respect to these assets. 
  Operating expenses   decreased     $8.4 million  , or   10 percent  , for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   due primarily to lower maintenance expense of $5.2 million at the Corpus Christi terminals related to inspection activity. Additionally, waste handling costs at the Corpus Christi and St. Charles terminals decreased $2.3 million in the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
  General and administrative expenses   increased     $1.2 million  , or   11 percent  , for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   due primarily to incremental costs of $714,000 related to the management fee charged to us by Valero related to our acquisitions of the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business, the McKee Terminal Services Business, and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business, and an increase of $624,000 in costs related to being a separate publicly traded limited partnership. These increases were offset by lower transaction costs (legal and investment advisor fees) of $164,000 associated with the acquisition of businesses from Valero.  
  Depreciation expense   decreased     $50,000   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   due primarily to $2.8 million in accelerated depreciation related to the retirement of certain assets of the McKee Crude System in the third quarter of 2015, mostly offset by an increase in depreciation expense on assets placed into service in the latter part of 2015 and the beginning of 2016, including expansion and improvement projects at our Corpus Christi, St. Charles, and Meraux terminals. 
   Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest    increased     $6.2 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   due primarily to interest expense incurred on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and under the subordinated credit agreement with Valero entered into in connection with the acquisitions. Interest expense on these incremental borrowings was approximately $5.2 million in the first   nine   months of 2016. 
  Our income tax expense (benefit) is associated with the Texas margin tax. During the first nine months of 2016, the relative amount of revenue we generate in Texas increased in connection with the acquisitions of the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business, the McKee Terminal Services Business, and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business. As a result, our income tax expense has increased. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of 2015, we reduced our deferred income tax liabilities due to a reduction in the relative amount of revenue we generate in Texas compared to our total revenue. This reduction was a result of the acquisition of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business (which includes operations in Louisiana). In addition, in June 2015, the Texas margin tax rate was reduced from 1 percent to 0.75 percent.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Sources of Liquidity 
  We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and issuances of additional debt and equity securities. We may also enter into financing transactions with Valero in connection with acquisitions. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions. 
  On September 16, 2016, we filed a prospectus supplement to our shelf registration statement (which was declared effective on September 1, 2016) and entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time our common units having an aggregate offering price of up to $350.0 million based on amounts and terms agreed to by us and at prices determined  at the market  at the time of sale (our ATM Program). During September 2016, we issued 65,980 common units under our ATM Program and received proceeds of $2.8 million (net of $39,000 of compensation paid with respect to the sales of these units). 
    
  Concurrent with the issuance of common units under our ATM Program, we issued 1,346 general partner units to our general partner on September 30, 2016 for $58,000 in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest in the Partnership.  
  Distributions 
  On   October 24, 2016  , the board of directors of our general partner declared a distribution of   $0.3850   per unit applicable to the   third quarter   of   2016  , which equates to   $32.2 million   in total distributions to unitholders of record as of   November 3, 2016  . This quarterly distribution per unit is more than the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2125 per unit.  
  Our distributions are declared subsequent to quarter end. The table below summarizes information related to our quarterly cash distributions that have been declared since January 1, 2015: 

40 

     Table of Contents  

The requirements under our partnership agreement for the conversion of all of our outstanding subordinated units into common units were satisfied upon the payment of our quarterly cash distribution on   August 9, 2016  . Therefore, effective   August 10, 2016  , all of our subordinated units, which were owned by Valero, were converted on a one-for-one basis into common units. The conversion of the subordinated units does not impact the amount of cash distributions paid or the total number of outstanding units.  
  Revolving Credit Facility 
  We have a   $750.0 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the Revolver) with a group of lenders that matures in November 2020. The Revolver includes a letter of credit sub-facility. In connection with the acquisitions of the McKee Terminal Services Business and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business, we borrowed   $139.0 million   and   $210.0 million   under the Revolver on   April 1, 2016   and   September 1, 2016  , respectively.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $524.0 million   of borrowings outstanding under the Revolver. See   Note 6   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Revolver. 
  Subordinated Credit Agreements 
  During 2015, we entered into two subordinated credit agreements with Valero (the Loan Agreements) under which we borrowed   $160.0 million   and   $395.0 million   to finance a portion of the acquisitions of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business and the Corpus Christi Terminal Services Business, respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $370.0 million   outstanding under the Loan Agreements. See   Note 6   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Loan Agreements. 
  Cash Flows Summary 
  Components of our cash flows are set forth below (in thousands): 

Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $162.2 million  , which included net income of   $129.0 million   plus noncash adjustments (primarily for depreciation expense) of   $35.4 million  , partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of   $2.2 million  . See  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  for further discussion of our operating results. The change in working capital was composed primarily of an     increase in receivables from related party of   $8.2 million  , partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue from related party of   $3.7 million  , as disclosed in   Note 11   of Condensed Notes to  

41 

     Table of Contents  

Consolidated Financial Statements.     The increase in receivables from related party was attributed primarily to billings related to our newly acquired McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers terminals. The increase in deferred revenue from related party is associated with minimum volume commitments. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities in the first   nine   months of   2015   was   $64.5 million  , which included net income of   $34.5 million   plus noncash adjustments (primarily for depreciation expense) of   $34.8 million  , partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of   $4.6 million  . See  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  for further discussion of our operating results. The change in working capital was composed primarily of an increase in receivables from related party of   $6.4 million  , partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of   $1.0 million  , as disclosed in   Note 11   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in receivables from related party was attributed primarily to an increase in billings related to the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business, which had been recently acquired from Valero. The increase in accounts payable was due primarily to the timing of project expenditures. 
  Investing Activities 
  Cash used for investing activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $119.5 million  , which was primarily impacted by the acquisitions of the   McKee Terminal Services Business   and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business on April 1, 2016 and September 1, 2016, respectively. In connection with the acquisitions, we paid $480.0 million in cash to Valero, and of this amount,   $103.6 million   represented Valero s carrying value in the net assets transferred to us, which was reflected as an investing activity. The remaining cash paid of   $376.4 million   represented the excess purchase price paid over the carrying value and was reflected as a financing activity as described below.  
  Cash used for investing activities in the first   nine   months of 2015 was   $326.8 million  , which was primarily impacted by the acquisition of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business on March 1, 2015. In connection with the acquisition, we paid $571.2 million in cash to Valero, and of this amount,   $296.1 million   represented Valero s carrying value in the net assets transferred to us, which was reflected as an investing activity. The remaining cash paid of   $275.1 million   represented the excess purchase price paid over the carrying value and was reflected as a financing activity as described below.  
  In addition, we and our Predecessor incurred capital expenditures of   $15.9 million   and   $30.7 million   for the first   nine   months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. See  Capital Expenditures  below for a discussion of the various maintenance and expansion projects. 
  Financing Activities 
  Cash used for financing activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $88.1 million  , which consisted primarily of the   $376.4 million   of excess purchase price paid over the carrying value for the acquisitions of the McKee Terminal Services Business and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business as described above under  Investing Activities.  These cash outflows were offset by $349.0 million of borrowings under the Revolver in connection with these acquisitions and we reflected a net transfer from Valero of   $14.9 million   related to the cash flows associated with our Predecessor. In addition, we paid   $77.2 million   of cash distributions to limited partners and our general partner. 
  In the first   nine   months of   2015  , our financing activities provided cash of   $76.3 million  , which consisted primarily of $200.0 million of borrowings under the Revolver and $160.0 million of proceeds from the loan agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business. These cash inflows were offset by the   $275.1 million   of excess purchase price paid over the carrying value for the acquisition of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business as described above under  

42 

     Table of Contents  

Investing Activities,  and we reflected a net transfer from Valero of   $68.8 million   related to the cash flows associated with our Predecessor. In addition, we paid   $51.6 million   of cash distributions to limited partners and our general partner. 
  See Notes   3   and   11   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisitions discussed above, including consideration paid and the cash and noncash elements of the acquisitions. 
  Capital Expenditures 
  Our operations can be capital intensive, requiring investments to expand, upgrade, or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements consist of maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures as those terms are defined in our partnership agreement. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are those made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining existing system volumes and related cash flows. In contrast, examples of expansion capital expenditures include those made to expand and upgrade our systems and facilities and to construct or acquire new systems or facilities to grow our business. 
  Our capital expenditures were as follows (in thousands):

      (b) This table excludes amounts paid to Valero for the acquired businesses. See Note 3 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our acquisitions. 

Our capital expenditures in the first   nine   months of   2016   were primarily for: 
             
    the construction of a connection to receive crude oil from the Seaway pipeline into our Lucas crude system;  
                
    the improvement of assets at our Meraux, Three Rivers, St. Charles, and Houston terminals to extend the useful lives of the tanks; and 
                
    the improvement of assets at our Lucas crude system for enhanced monitoring of pipeline shipments. 
     Our capital expenditures in the first   nine   months of   2015   were primarily for: 
             
    the expansion and improvement of assets at our Corpus Christi, Meraux, St. Charles, and Houston terminals; and 
                
    the construction of a connection to receive crude oil from the Seaway pipeline into our Lucas crude system. 

43 

     Table of Contents  

For the full year   2016  , we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $22.0 million. Our estimate consists of approximately $11.0 million for maintenance capital expenditures and approximately $11.0 million for expansion capital expenditures. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. We anticipate that these capital expenditures will be funded from cash flows from operations. The foregoing capital expenditure estimate does not include any amounts related to strategic business acquisitions. 
  In addition to the above-mentioned capital expenditures, Valero funded $23.8 million of capital projects primarily related to the Houston, St. Charles, Corpus Christi, and Meraux terminals. Valero agreed to fund these projects in connection with the acquisitions from Valero. See   Note 11   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of these noncash activities. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our contractual obligations included debt and capital lease obligations, operating leases, purchase obligations, and other long-term liabilities. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we borrowed   $139.0 million   and   $210.0 million   under the Revolver in connection with the acquisitions of the McKee Terminal Services Business and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business, respectively. In addition, in connection with the acquisitions from Valero, we entered into lease and access agreements with Valero with respect to the land on which each terminal is located. See Notes   4   and   6   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of the lease and access agreements and the Revolver. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business with respect to our contractual obligations during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Regulatory Matters 
  Rate and Other Regulations 
  Our interstate common carrier crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Interstate Commerce Act and Energy Policy Act. Our pipelines and terminal operations are also subject to safety regulations adopted by the Department of Transportation, as well as to state regulations. For more information on federal and state regulations affecting our business, please read our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  . 
  Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs 
  We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to remediate environmental damage from any discharge of petroleum or chemical substances from our facilities or require us to install additional pollution control equipment on our equipment and facilities. Our failure to comply with these or any other environmental or safety-related regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities, and the issuance of injunctions that may subject us to additional operational constraints. 
  There were no significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since the date our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015   was filed. 
   
           Item 3.   
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Because we do not take ownership of or receive any payments based on the value of the crude oil or refined petroleum products that we handle and do not engage in the trading of any commodities, we have no direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations. 
  Our commercial agreements with Valero are indexed to inflation to mitigate our exposure to increases in the cost of labor and materials used in our business. 
  Debt incurred under our Revolver and our Loan Agreement bears interest at a variable rate and exposes us to interest rate risk. Unless interest rates increase significantly in the future, our exposure to interest rate risk should be minimal. We had debt of   $524.0 million   and notes payable to related party totaling   $370.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
           (a) 
    Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
     Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 (e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
           (b) 
    Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
     There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
