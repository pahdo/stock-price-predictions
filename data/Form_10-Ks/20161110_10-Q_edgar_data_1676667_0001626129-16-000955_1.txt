(1)            Presentation
of Financial Statements  

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Carolina Trust BancShares, Inc. (the  Company ), its subsidiary Carolina Trust Bank (the  Bank ),
and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, Western Carolina Holdings, LLC, which owns certain Bank assets. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. On August 16, 2016, the Company announced that it had consummated
the statutory share exchange pursuant to which it became the parent company of the Bank. Shares of the Bank s common stock
were exchanged for shares of the Company s common stock at a one-for-one exchange rate. The Company is a North Carolina business
corporation that is operating as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The
Bank is the only subsidiary of the Company. 

In management s opinion,
the financial information, which is unaudited, reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary
for fair presentation of the financial information as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine-month periods then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Operating results for the three and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2016. 

The organization and business
of Carolina Trust BancShares, Inc., accounting policies followed by the Company and other information are contained in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of the Bank s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This quarterly report
should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report. 

(2)           Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In January 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-01,  Financial Instruments
- Overall, Subtopic 825-10  ( ASU 2016-1 ) to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation,
and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the guidance by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the
balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable
fair values will be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the amendments. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance. 

In
August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606  ( ASU
2014-09 ).  The new standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under existing
guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration
to include in the transaction price and allocating
the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. As a result of the deferral, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments can
be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this
new guidance recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new
guidance on the consolidated financial statements, but the Company does not expect it to have a material impact.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-02,  Leases,  which amended the Leases topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to revise certain aspects of
recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of leasing transactions. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the
effect that implementation of the new standard will have on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-09,  Investments to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting,  which is new guidance related to stock compensation.
The new guidance eliminates the concept of additional paid-in capital pools for stock-based awards and requires that the related
excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance
also allows entities to make a one-time policy election to account for forfeitures when they occur, instead of accruing compensation
cost based on the number of awards expected to vest. Additionally, the new guidance changes the requirement for an award to qualify
for equity classification by permitting tax withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rate instead of the minimum statutory tax
rate. Cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing
activity in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The new standard introduces an approach based on expected
losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale
(AFS) debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since
their origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect
that implementation of the new standard will have on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).  The
new guidance amended the Statement of Cash Flows topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify how certain cash receipts
and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for the Company
for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect
these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.

Other accounting standards that
have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

(3)            Noncontrolling
Interest   

Due to the formation of the Holding
Company, the Company recognizes $2,580,000 of the Bank s preferred stock as a noncontrolling interest in Stockholders 
Equity. On February 6, 2009, the Bank issued $4,000,000 of Senior Preferred Shares to the U.S. Department of Treasury (the  Treasury ),
consisting of 4,000 shares, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. In addition, on February 6, 2009, the Bank issued
a warrant to the Treasury to purchase 86,957 common shares at an initial exercise price of $6.90 per share with an expiration date
of February 6, 2019. Generally accepted accounting principles required management to allocate the net proceeds from the issuance
of the preferred stock between the preferred stock and related warrant based upon a relative fair value method. The terms of the
preferred shares required management to pay a non-cumulative dividend at the rate of 5 percent per annum for the first five years
and 9 percent thereafter. The dividend rate changed from 5 percent to 9 percent on February 16, 2014. Management has determined
that the 5 percent dividend rate is below market value, therefore, the fair value of the preferred shares would be less than the
$4,000,000 in proceeds. Management determined that a reasonable market rate is 14 percent for the fair value of the preferred shares.
Management used the Black-Scholes model for calculating the fair value of the warrant (and related common shares). The allocation
between the preferred shares and warrant at February 6, 2009, the date of issuance, net of issuance costs of $20,000 was $3,554,000
and $426,000, respectively. The discount on the preferred of $426,000 was accreted through retained earnings over a 60 month period. 

In November 2012, the U.S. Treasury
sold the preferred stock to several investors in a Dutch auction process. The Bank had designated a third party bidder to act on
its behalf pursuant to the rules of the Dutch auction. In December 2012, pursuant to its agreement with the third party bidder,
the Bank in turn repurchased 35% of the preferred stock or $1.4 million at a price of 85.3% of par or $1,194,000 from one of the
investors, the same price at which the bidder had purchased the preferred stock from the U.S. Treasury. The gain from the redemption
below par totaling $206,000 increased surplus and reduced the amount reported as dividends to preferred shareholders for the year
ended December 31, 2012. Following this redemption, the Bank s preferred stock balance was $2,580,000, which is the par value
$2,600,000, net of $20,000 issuance costs. 

In June 2013, the U.S. Treasury
sold the warrant to private investors in a Dutch auction process. Following the reorganization of the Bank into Company, the right
to acquire up to 86,957 shares of Bank common stock was converted in the right to purchase the same number of shares of Company
common stock. The warrant book value, $426,000 is recognized as Company stockholders  equity.

(4)            Earnings
Per Share   

Basic Earnings per Common
Share   

Basic earnings per common share
is computed by dividing net income to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period, after giving retroactive effect to stock splits and dividends. 

Diluted Earnings per Common
Share   

  The
computation of diluted earnings per common share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per common share except
that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
dilutive potential common shares had been issued. These additional common shares would include employee equity share options,
nonvested shares and similar equity instruments granted to employees, as well as the shares associated with the common stock
warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury Department as part of the preferred stock transaction completed in February 2009.
Diluted earnings per common share are based upon the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited unless
doing so would be antidilutive. The numerator is adjusted for any changes in income or loss that would result from the
assumed conversion of those potential common shares.   

The following tables summarize
earnings per share and the shares utilized in the computations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively:

CAROLINA
TRUST BANCSHARES, INC. 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

For both the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 there were 134,690 and 144,691 shares, respectively, related to stock options and the common stock
warrant that were anti-dilutive because the exercise price exceeded the average market price for the period. For the three and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 there were 189,886 and 245,384 shares, respectively, related to stock options and the
common stock warrant that were anti-dilutive because the exercise price exceeded the average market price for the period. Therefore,
they were omitted from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for their respective periods.  

(5)            Fair
Value Measurements   

The Company is required to disclose
the estimated fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities on and off the balance sheet, for which it is practicable
to estimate fair value. These fair value estimates are made at each balance sheet date, based on relevant market information and
information about the financial instruments. Fair value estimates are intended to represent the price an asset could be sold at
or the price a liability could be settled for. However, given there is no active market or observable market transactions for many
of the Bank s financial instruments, the Company has made estimates of many of these fair values which are subjective in
nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimated values. The methodologies for financial assets and financial liabilities are
discussed below: 

Cash and Due from Banks, Interest-Earning
Deposits with Banks, Certificates of Deposits with Banks and Federal Funds Sold  

The carrying amounts for cash
and due from banks, interest-earning deposits with banks, certificates of deposits with banks and federal funds sold approximate
fair value because of the short maturities of those instruments. 

14  

CAROLINA
TRUST BANCSHARES, INC. 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Investment Securities  

Fair value for investment securities
equals the quoted market price if such information is available. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated
using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as present value of future cash flows, adjusted
for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. 

Loans  

The fair value of loans is estimated
based on discounted expected cash flows. These cash flows include assumptions for prepayment estimates over the remaining life
of each loan, considerations for the current interest rate environment compared to the weighted average rate of each portfolio
and a credit risk component based on the historical and expected performance of each portfolio. The calculation does not include
an estimate for illiquidity in the market. 

Accrued Interest  

The carrying amount
is a reasonable estimate of fair value. 

Deposits  

The fair value of demand deposits,
savings, money market and NOW accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of time deposits is
estimated by discounting expected cash flows using the rates currently offered for instruments of similar remaining maturities. 

Federal Funds Purchased  

Federal funds purchased approximate
fair value because of their short maturity. 

Capital Lease Obligation
and Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank  

The fair value of borrowings
is based upon discounted expected cash flows using current rates at which borrowings of similar maturity could be obtained. 

15  

CAROLINA
TRUST BANCSHARES, INC. 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The carrying amounts and estimated
fair values of the Company s financial instruments, none of which are held for trading purposes, are as follows at September
30, 2016 and December 31 2015: 

During the first quarter of 2016,
management reevaluated its fair value leveling methodology and the inputs utilized in determining the valuation of deposits for
the current and prior periods. Management concluded that due to the significant reliance on observable inputs, the fair values
of its deposits should be classified as Level 2 rather than Level 3 as previously disclosed. Therefore deposits with a carrying
value of $284,794 and a fair value of $277,308 as of 12/31/15 were reclassified from Level 3 to Level 2. 

CAROLINA
TRUST BANCSHARES, INC. 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

The Company utilizes fair value
measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Securities
available-for-sale, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required
to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application
of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 

Fair Value Hierarchy  

 The Company groups assets and
liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability
of the assumptions used to determine fair value. 

Level 1  Valuation based upon quoted prices for identical instruments
traded in active markets. 

Level 2  Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments
in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation
techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 

Level 3  Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that
use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models,
discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 

Following
is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. 

Investment Securities
Available-for-Sale  

 Investment securities available-for-sale
are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices
are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as
present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors
such as credit loss assumptions. Level 1 securities included those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange,
U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in an active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Level
2 securities included U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by government-sponsored entities,
and municipal bonds. Securities classified as Level 3 include a corporate debt security and a common stock in a less liquid market.
The value of the corporate debt security is determined via the going rate of a similar debt security if it were to enter the market
at period end. The derived market value requires significant management judgment and is further substantiated by discounted cash
flow methodologies. There have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Valuation techniques
are consistent with techniques used in prior periods.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Impaired Loans  

 The Company does not
record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance
for loan losses is established. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in
accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as
individually impaired, management measures it for impairment. The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of
several methods, including collateral value, a loan s observable market price and discounted cash flows. Those impaired
loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value exceeds the recorded investments in such loans. At
September 30, 2016 the discounted cash flows method was used in determining the fair value of eight loans totaling $3.1
million and the fair value of the collateral method was used in the other thirty-five loans totaling $5.4 million. At
December 31, 2015, the discounted cash flows method was used in determining the fair value of eight loans totaling $3.2
million and the fair value of the collateral method was used in the other forty-one loans totaling $4.3 million. Impaired
loans where an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral and also when written down with the discounted
cash flow method require classification in the fair value hierarchy. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an
observable market price or a current appraised value of an identical property, the Company records the impaired loan as
nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is
further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Company records the impaired loan as
nonrecurring Level 3. When the discounted cash flows method is used, the Company records the impaired loan as
nonrecurring Level 3. There have been no changes in valuation techniques for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Valuation
techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods. 

The following table presents
impaired loans that were re-measured and reported at fair value through a specific valuation allowance allocation of the allowance
for loan losses based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral or discounted cash flows during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. 

Other real
estate owned  

Other
real estate owned ( OREO ) is adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to OREO. Subsequently, OREO is carried
at the lower of carrying value or fair value. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral
or management s estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable
market price or a current appraised value for an identical property, the Company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level
2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below
the appraised value and there is not an observable market price, the Company records the OREO as nonrecurring Level 3. There have been no
changes in valuation techniques for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used
in prior periods.

The
amortized cost and fair values of securities available for sale (excluding marketable equity securities) at September 30, 2016
by contractual maturity are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have
the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  

The
following tables detail unrealized losses and related fair values in the Company s available-for-sale investment security

loss position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

*
    Such as FNMA, FHLMC and FHLB.  

Management
considers the nature of the investment, the underlying causes of the decline in the market value and the severity and duration
of the decline in market value in determining if impairment is other than temporary. Consideration is given to (1) the length
of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of
the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient
to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. As of September 30, 2016, management believes that it is more likely than
not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are largely due
to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair
value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments
decline.

Credit Quality Indicators   

As part of the on-going monitoring of credit
quality of the Company s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to
(i) the local, state and national economic outlook, (ii) concentrations of credit, (iii) interest rate movements, (iv) volume,
mix and size of loans and (v) delinquencies. 

The Company utilizes a risk-grading matrix
to assign a risk grade to each of its commercial and consumer loans. Loans are graded on a scale of 1-9. Risk grades 1-5 represent
pass rated loans. The general characteristics of the 9 risk grades are broken down into commercial and consumer and described below: 

Loan Portfolio Risk Grades  

Pass credits are grades 1-5
and represent credits with above average risk characteristics that are in accordance with loan policy guidelines regarding repayment
ability, loan to value, and credit history. These types of credits have very few exceptions to policy. 

Grade 6    Watch
List or Special Mention. The loans in this category include the following characteristics: 

* Loans with one or more
major exceptions with no mitigating factors. 

*Extending loans that are currently
performing satisfactorily but with potential weaknesses that may, if not corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the
Bank s position at some future date. Potential weaknesses are the result of deviations from prudent lending practice. 

*Loans where adverse economic
conditions that develop subsequent to the loan origination that do not jeopardize liquidation of the debt but do substantially
increase the level of risk may also warrant this rating. 

Grade
7    Substandard. A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound net
worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard must have a well-defined
weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt; they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the
institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans consistently not meeting the repayment schedule
should be downgraded to substandard. Loans in this category are characterized by deterioration in quality exhibited by any
number of well-defined weaknesses requiring corrective action. The weaknesses may include, but are not limited to (i) high debt
to worth ratios, (ii) declining or negative earnings trends, (iii) declining or inadequate liquidity, (iv) improper loan structure,
(v) questionable repayment sources, (vi) lack of well-defined secondary repayment source, and (vii) unfavorable competitive
comparisons.   

31  

CAROLINA
TRUST BANCSHARES, INC. 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  

Grade 8    Doubtful.
Loans classified Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified Substandard, plus the added characteristic that
the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable
and improbable. However, these loans are not yet rated as loss because certain events may occur which would salvage the debt. Among
these events are injection of capital, alternative financing and liquidation of assets or the pledging of additional collateral.
The ability of the borrower to service the debt is extremely weak, overdue status is constant, the debt has been placed on non-accrual
status, and no definite repayment schedule exists. Doubtful is a temporary grade where a loss is expected but is presently not
quantified with any degree of accuracy. Once the loss position is determined, the amount is charged off. 

Grade 9
   Loss.  Loans classified Loss are considered uncollectable and of such little value that
their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery
or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this worthless loan even though partial
recovery may be affected in the future.  Probable loss portions of Doubtful assets should be charged against the Reserve
for Loan Losses. Loans may reside in this classification for administrative purposes for a period not to exceed the earlier of
thirty (30) days or calendar quarter-end.

Allowance
for Loan Losses  

The
allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the
loan portfolio. Management determines the allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors, including a review and evaluation
of the Company s loan portfolio and current and projected economic conditions locally and nationally. The allowance is monitored
and analyzed in conjunction with the Company s loan analysis and grading program and provisions for loan losses are made to maintain
an adequate allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations. Losses on loans
are charged against the allowance for loan losses in the accounting period in which they are determined by management to be uncollectible.
Recoveries during the period are credited to the allowance. The provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the
allowance for loan losses to the amount that management has determined to be adequate to provide for potential losses inherent
in the loan portfolio. Certain changes in factors may cause increases or decreases to the allowance for loan losses. The Company
recorded $202,000 in provisions for loan losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The Company recognized a recovery of
$170,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Management realizes that general economic trends greatly affect loan losses,
and no assurances can be made that future charges to the loan loss allowance may not be significant in relation to the amount
provided during a particular period, or that future evaluations of the loan portfolio based on conditions then prevailing will
not require sizable additions to the allowance, thus necessitating similarly sizable charges to income. Based on its best judgment,
evaluation, and analysis of the loan portfolio, management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate for the reporting
periods.

for loan losses by portfolio segment and disaggregated on the Company s impairment methodology was as follows:  

At
September 30, 2016 the Company had pre-approved but unused lines of credit totaling $52.1 million. In management s opinion
these unused lines of credit represent no more than normal lending risk to the Company and will be funded from normal sources
of liquidity.  

The
Company has entered loan transactions with certain of its directors and executive officers. Such loans were made in the ordinary
course of business and on substantially the same terms and collateral as those for comparable transactions prevailing at the time
and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.

summary of related party loan transactions as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

At
September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company had pre-approved but unused lines of credit totaling $132,000 and $136,000, respectively,

 Stock Option Plans    

The
Bank has six share-based compensation plans in effect at September 30, 2016 and at September 30, 2015. The compensation cost charged
against income for those plans was approximately $5,000 and $48,000 respectively for the three and nine month periods ended September

2015 was $34,000 and $98,000, respectively.  

During
2001 the Bank adopted, with shareholder approval, an Incentive Stock Option Plan (the  2001 Employee Plan ) and a
Non-statutory Stock Option Plan (the  2001 Director Plan ). Each plan makes available options to purchase 100,771
shares of the Bank s common stock, for an aggregate number of common shares reserved for options under these plans of 201,542.
The exercise price of all options granted to date under these plans is $3.14.

compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock grants under all of the Bank s stock benefit plans. This cost is
expected to be recognized during 2016. 

Upon exercise of the options, the Bank
issues shares from authorized but unissued shares. The Bank does not typically purchase shares to fulfill obligations of the stock
benefit plans.

Recent Developments  

Bank Holding Company Reorganization  

As previously
reported, at Carolina Trust Bank s (the  Bank ) annual meeting held on May 10, 2016, the Bank s shareholders
approved the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company form of organization. On August 16, 2016, the Company announced
that it had consummated the statutory share exchange pursuant to which it became the parent company of the Bank. Shares of the
Bank s common stock were exchanged for shares of the Company s common stock at a one-for-one exchange rate. The Company
is a North Carolina business corporation that is operating as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended. The Bank is the only subsidiary of the Company. Additional detail regarding the reorganization can be
found in the Bank s definitive proxy statement filed with the FDIC on April 6, 2016 and in the Company s current report
on Form 8-K filed with SEC on August 16, 2016.  

Clarification of Board Committee Membership  

In the Bank s proxy statement filed
on April 6, 2016, the Bank listed its Chairman, Johnathan L. Rhyne, Jr., as an ex officio member of its audit committee and its
President and CEO, Jerry L. Ocheltree, as an ex officio member of its compensation committee. This was incorrect, and Mr. Rhyne,
who is an independent director, is a member of the audit committee. Mr. Ocheltree is not a member of the compensation committee,
whether in a non-voting or an ex officio capacity. Upon the compensation committee s request, Mr. Ocheltree provides such
information or presentations as the compensation committee may request. 

Private Placement of Subordinated Notes  

On October 13, 2016, the Company entered
into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with certain institutional accredited investors
(the  Purchasers ) pursuant to which the Company issued and sold $10 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.900%
fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2026 (the  Notes ). The Notes were issued by the Company to the Purchasers
at a price equal to 100% of their face amount. 

The Notes have a stated maturity of October
15, 2026 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.900% per year, from and including October 13, 2016, to but excluding October 15,
2021, computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, payable semi-annually in arrears. From and including
October 15, 2021, to but excluding the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest
rate per year equal to the then-current three-month LIBOR plus 571.8 basis points, computed on the basis of a 360-day year and
the actual number of days elapsed, payable quarterly in arrears. The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, on or after October
13, 2021, and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events.    

Discussion of Financial Condition
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 

During the period from December 31, 2015
to September 30, 2016, total assets increased by approximately $38.1 million, or 11.41%. The increase, reflected primarily in interest
earning deposits with banks, investment securities available for sale, and loans, was funded by an increase in deposits and Federal
Home Loan Bank advances. Interest-earning deposits with banks, federal funds sold, and securities available for sale at September
30, 2016 totaled $54.0 million compared to $23.0 million at December 31, 2015. 

The Company s investment securities
portfolio as of September 30, 2016 totaled $26.9 million, an increase of $4.0 million from the $22.9 million reported at December
31, 2015. All of the company s investment securities are classified as Available for Sale (AFS). During the third quarter
of 2016, in order to reduce risk-weighted assets and to increase earnings and risk-based capital, the Company made a decision to
sell an investment security in the amount of $747,000. The Company realized a net gain of $55,000 on this transaction. At September
30, 2016, the Company had net unrealized gains on available for sale securities of $197,000, net of tax, as compared to net unrealized
loss of $218,000, net of tax, at December 31, 2015. 

At September 30, 2016, net loans constituted
80.00% of the Company s total assets. Net loans increased by $9.1 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. All
of the portfolio segments increased during the first nine months of 2016, with commercial real estate experiencing the largest
amount of growth at $5.2 million or 3.17%. Management s continued goal is to grow the loan portfolio to provide maximum income
proportionate with acceptable risks. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 impaired loans, which consisted primarily of troubled debt restructures and non-accrual loans, were $8.5 million and $7.5
million respectively. Impaired loans of $2.7 million and $1.6 million had related allowances for loan losses aggregating $811,000
and $214,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. There were $5.8 million and $5.9 million of impaired loans
without an allowance at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Impaired loans at September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of commercial
real estate, commercial and industrial and residential mortgage loans. At September 30, 2016 there were ten loans amounting to
approximately $4.7 million, which were restructured to facilitate the borrowers  ability to repay the outstanding balance.
These ten restructured loans are considered troubled debt restructurings at September 30, 2016 and have specific reserves amounting
to approximately $178,000. Of these ten loans, nine loans totaling $4.6 million were accruing interest at September 30, 2016. At
December 31, 2015, there were ten loans totaling $4.9 million which were restructured to facilitate the borrowers  ability
to repay the outstanding balance and of these ten loans, nine loans totaling $4.7 million were accruing interest. Reserves for
loans not considered impaired were approximately $2.9 million and $3.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is 1.22% and 1.27% respectively of gross loans outstanding.
This decrease in this percentage is due to decrease in the historical charge offs used in the model which uses the prior three
years of losses that are part of the general allowance for non-impaired loans. 

The Company records provisions for loan
losses based upon known problem loans and estimated probable losses in the existing loan portfolio. The Company s methodology
for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key components, which are a specific allowance
for identified problem or impaired loans and a model estimating probable losses for the remainder of the portfolio. 

Identified problem and impaired loans are
measured for impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate,
the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. This evaluation is
inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. The adequacy of the allowance
is also reviewed by management based upon its evaluation of then-existing economic and business conditions affecting the key lending
areas of the Company and other conditions, such as new loan products, collateral values, loan concentrations, changes in the mix
and volume of the loan portfolio, trends in portfolio credit quality, including delinquency and charge-off rates and current economic
conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay. Although management believes it has established and maintained the allowance
for loan losses at appropriate levels, future adjustments may be necessary if economic, real estate and other conditions differ
substantially from the current operating environment. 

Non-interest earning assets consisting
of cash and due from banks, bank premises, equipment and software, foreclosed assets and other assets decreased to $15.5 million
at September 30, 2016 compared to $17.5 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease is attributed mostly to the decrease in foreclosed
assets of $1.1 million due to the sale of nine properties. At September 30, 2016 foreclosed assets consisted of seven properties
valued at $879,000. 

Deposit accounts represent the Company s
primary funding source and are comprised of non-interest bearing demand deposits, interest bearing demand deposits, savings accounts
and time deposits. Total deposits increased by approximately $38.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The
increase is primarily due to the increase in institutional deposits of $21 million. Non-interest bearing demand deposits, money
market and NOW deposits, savings deposits and time deposits increased by approximately $8.4 million, $15.6 million, $0.3 million
and $13.9 million respectively. 

Federal Home Loan Bank advances totaled
$14.1 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $1.1 million over the $13.0 million advanced at December 31, 2015. 

Stockholders  equity amounted to
$31.7 million, or 8.52% of total assets at September 30, 2016, compared to $30.5 million, or 9.12% of total assets at December
31, 2015. 

Discussion of Results of Operations

For the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Net Income and Net Income Available
to Common Shareholders  

Net income for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $85,000 compared to $431,000 for the third quarter of 2015, a decrease of $346,000. Net income available to common
shareholders (which includes the effect of dividends on the aforementioned non-controlling interest) was $27,000 for the third
quarter of 2016 compared to $372,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The net income available to common shareholders
for the third quarter of 2016 is a decrease of $345,000 when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Diluted earnings per common
share was $0.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.08 for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in
net income is primarily due to an increase in the loan loss provision of $372,000 or $238,000 net of taxes. The provision for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 of $202,000 was attributed to a specific reserve for one commercial loan that was downgraded
during the quarter. 

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income is the primary source
of earnings for the Company. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets (primarily loans and
investment securities) and the interest expense on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities. Net interest spread is the
difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest
margin is the ratio of net interest income to average assets for the period. Changes in net interest income result from changes
in interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, totaled $3,274,000 compared to $3,292,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The Company s net
interest spread was approximately 3.52% and 4.04% for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net interest
margin on average interest earning assets was 3.67% and 4.17% for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Net interest spread decreased by 52 basis points, and net interest margin decreased by 50 basis points. The decreases in net interest
spread and net interest margin are due primarily to a lower yields on average earning assets. The bank grew deposits in the first
quarter of 2016 to build liquidity, following its rapid loan growth in 2015. While some of the funds were invested in securities,
most of the cash was invested in overnight interest bearing accounts to maintain liquidity for future loan growth. This growth
in overnight funds as a percentage of earning assets in 2016 resulted in a lower yield as compared to 2015. 

Provision for Loan Losses  

The Company recorded a provision for loan
losses of $202,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and recovery of $170,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
This increase in the provision for loan losses is due to an increase in impaired loans and also an increase in the amount of loans
outstanding. The recovery in the prior-period was the result of improvement in credit quality trends, including lower nonperforming
assets, lower charge-off levels and lower classified asset levels. The ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage
of total loans decreased from 1.34% at September 30, 2015 to 1.22% at September 30, 2016. This decrease in this percentage is due
to decrease in the historical charge offs used in the model which uses the prior three years of losses that are components of the
general allowance for non-impaired loans. The provision for loan losses is charged to operations to bring the allowance to a level
deemed appropriate based on management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. 

The following table sets forth information
with respect to the asset quality of our loan portfolio. 

Non-interest Income  

Non-interest income for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 totaled $349,000, an increase of $65,000 over the $284,000 reported for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
The primary factor contributing to the overall increase was the gain on the sale of an investment security of $55,000 recorded
in the third quarter of 2016. Interchange fee income increased $16,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 when compared to
the same period in 2015. The increase in interchange fees is due to an increase in the number of deposit accounts. Overdraft fees
on deposits, service charges on deposits, mortgage fee income, customer service fees, ATM income and other income remained relatively
constant for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

Non-interest Expense  

Non-interest expenses for the September
30, 2016 and 2015 quarters totaled $3,172,000 and $2,848,000, respectively. The $324,000 increase was due in part to a $106,000
or 134% increase in professional fees due to legal fees, audit fees, compliance support, strategic planning, and other consultants.
Legal fees related to the reorganization to a bank holding company accounted for most of the increase. There was also an increase
of $98,000 or 196% in foreclosed asset expense, due to an increase in impairment losses on foreclosed properties. Salaries and
employee benefits expense increased by $69,000 or 4.3% due to health insurance cost increases. An increase of $50,000 was also
recorded in data processing expense due to an increase in the number of customer accounts and also due to expenses for conversion
of our core processing systems that is in progress. The conversion is scheduled to be completed in second quarter of 2017. Insurance
expenses decreased $63,000. This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in deposit insurance. 

Income Tax Expense  

The Company recorded income tax expense
of $164,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 resulting in an effective tax rate of 66%. For the same period
in 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $467,000 with an effective tax rate of 52%. The state of North Carolina reduced
its corporate tax rate to 4% in 2016 and is reducing the tax rate to 3% in 2017. Income tax expense for both periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 include rate revaluations of $79,000 and $99,000, respectively, of the deferred tax asset to reflect these decreases
in state corporate tax rates. If the rate revaluations are excluded, the effective tax rates would be 34% for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 and 41% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 

Discussion of Results of Operations

For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Net Income and Net Income Available
to Common Shareholders  

Net income for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $959,000 compared to $967,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $8,000. Net income available
to common shareholders (which includes the effect of dividends on the aforementioned non-controlling interest) was $784,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $791,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a $7,000 decrease.
Diluted earnings per common share was $0.17 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, totaled $10,042,000 compared to $9,239,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s
net interest spread was approximately 3.72% and 4.05% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net
interest margin on average interest earning assets was 3.87% and 4.18% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The decreases in net interest spread and net interest margin were 0.33% and 0.31% respectively. The decreases in net interest spread
and net interest margin are due primarily to a lower yields on average earning assets. The increase in net interest income at September
30, 2016 when compared to September 30, 2015 is due to the increase in the volume of interest earning assets, primarily loans. 

Provision for Loan Losses  

The Company recorded provisions for loan
losses of $122,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and recorded a recovery of provision for loan losses of $170,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in the provision for loan losses is due to an increase in impaired
loans and also an increase in the amount of loans outstanding. The recovery in the prior-period was the result of improvement in
credit quality trends, including lower nonperforming assets, lower charge-off levels and lower classified asset levels. The provision
for loan losses is charged to operations to bring the allowance to a level deemed appropriate based on management s evaluation
of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. 

45  

Non-interest Income  

Non-interest income for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $947,000 and $807,000, respectively. The increase of $140,000 is comprised of interchange
fee income, gain on the sale of an investment security of $55,000, and overdraft fees. Interchange fee income increased $59,000
or 21.9% and overdraft fees increased $34,000 or 12.6% due to the increase in the number of deposit accounts. 

Non-interest Expense  

Non-interest expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $9,245,000 and $8,401,000, respectively. The $844,000 increase was due in part to a $287,000
or 6.0% increase in salaries and employee benefits as a result of health insurance increases, merit increases and performance bonus
increases. There was also an increase of $312,000 or 162.5% in professional fees due to legal fees, audit fees, compliance support,
strategic planning, and other consulting services. Legal fees related to the reorganization to a bank holding company accounted
for most of the increase. Foreclosed asset expense also increased $188,000 or 98.4% due to an increase in impairment losses on
foreclosed property. An increase of $75,000 or 15.6% was also recorded in data processing expense due to an increase in the number
of customer accounts and also due to expenses for conversion of our core products that is currently in process. The conversion
is to be completed in second quarter of 2017. These increases were offset partially by decreases in insurance expense and loan
expense of $77,000 and $84,000, respectively. The decrease in insurance expense is due to the decrease in the deposit insurance.
The decrease in loan expense is due to decreases in loan collection expense. 

Income Tax Expense  

The Company recorded income tax expense
of $663,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting in an effective tax rate of 41%. For the same period in 2015,
the Company recorded income tax expense of $848,000 with an effective tax rate of 47%. The state of North Carolina reduced its
corporate tax rate to 4% in 2016 and is reducing the tax rate to 3% in 2017. Income tax expense for both periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 include rate revaluations of $79,000 and $99,000, respectively, of the deferred tax asset to reflect these decreases
in state corporate tax rates. If the rate revaluations are excluded, the effective tax rates would be 36% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 41% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity   

The Company s liquidity is a measure
of its ability to fund loans, withdrawals and maturities of deposits, and other cash outflows in a cost effective manner. The Company s
principal sources of liquidity are deposits, scheduled payments and prepayments of loan principal, maturities of investment securities,
access to liquid assets, and funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively
predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions
and competition. Liquid assets, which consist of cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits with banks, certificates of
deposits with banks, federal funds sold and investment securities classified as available for sale, comprised 16.14% and 8.75%
of total assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

46  

Should the need arise, management believes
the Company would have the capability to sell securities classified as available for sale or to borrow funds as necessary to meet
the Company s cash flow demands. The Company has established credit lines with other financial institutions to purchase up
to $13 million in federal funds and to borrow up to $10 million under a reverse repurchase agreement. There were no borrowings
outstanding against these credit lines at September 30, 2016. The Company has also established a credit line with the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Atlanta. The credit line is secured by a portion of the Company s loan portfolio that qualifies under FHLB guidelines
as eligible collateral. Total availability, based on collateral pledged at September 30, 2016 was $60.7 million, of which $14.1
million was advanced. 

Total deposits were $323 million and $284.8
million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively. Time deposits, which are the only deposit accounts that have
stated maturity dates, are generally considered to be rate sensitive. Time deposits represented 51.28% and 53.29% of total deposits
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company had brokered
time deposits of $25.7 million and $27.3 million respectively. Management accepts time deposits from outside the Bank s local
market area when such funding sources are necessary to fund growth and the rates paid are comparable to rates offered to retail
customers or lower. Management believes most time deposits are relationship-oriented.  While
the Company will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at their maturities, there are other subjective factors
that will determine their continued retention. Based upon prior experience, the Company anticipates that a substantial portion
of outstanding certificates of deposit will renew upon maturity.  

Management believes that the Company s
current sources of funds provide adequate liquidity for its current cash flow needs. 

Capital Resources  

Future growth and expansion of the Company
are dictated by the ability to create capital, which is generated principally by retained earnings. Adequacy of the Company s capital
is also monitored to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. One of management s primary objectives is to maintain
a strong capital position in order to warrant confidence from customers, investors, bank regulators and stockholders. A measure
of capital position is capital adequacy, defined as the amount of capital needed to maintain future asset growth and absorb unforeseen
losses. Regulators consider a variety of factors in determining an institution s capital adequacy, including quality and
stability of earnings, asset quality, guidance and expertise and liquidity. Regulatory guidelines place an emphasis on stockholders 
equity in relationship to total assets adjusted for risk. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve issued
final rules to include technical changes to its market risk capital rules to align them with the Basel III regulatory capital framework
and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Effective January 1, 2015, the final rules require the Company and the Bank
to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets;
(ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital
ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the prior requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets
(unchanged from the prior requirement). These are the initial capital requirements, which will be phased in over a four-year period.
When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the rules will require the Company and the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common
equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5%  capital conservation buffer  (which is added to
the 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier
1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets
of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is
phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of
total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total
capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation),
and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. 

47  

The capital conservation buffer requirement
began January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, and will increase by the same amount each year until fully implemented
at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking
institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will
face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 

Management considers the Company and the
Bank to be well-capitalized and expects to be able to meet future needs caused by growth and expansion, as well as capital requirements
implemented by the regulatory agencies. 

Beginning January 1,
2015, the Company and the Bank calculate regulatory capital under the U.S. Basel III Standardized Approach. 

The Table below presents
the regulatory capital ratios for the Bank.  

Item 4. - Controls and Procedures  

As of the end of the period covered by
this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management,
including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
No change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.
