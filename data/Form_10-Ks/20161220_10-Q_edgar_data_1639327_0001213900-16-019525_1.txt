NOTE
1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with both accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation
S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes
that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.  

In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair presentation
of the financial information for the interim periods reported have been made. Results of operations for the six months ended October
31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year ending April 30, 2017 or any period thereafter.  

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management s
Discussion and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended April 30, 2016.  

NOTE
2 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND   

Gushen,
Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated on March 9, 2015 in the state of Nevada. The Company is a development stage
company with nominal operations. The principal activities of the Company are the provision of managerial assistance services including
funding, administrative and IT support services for small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) and money lending service
in Hong Kong through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Gushen Holding Limited ( Gushen Holding ), a company incorporated
in the Republic of Seychelles, and Gushen Credit Limited ( Gushen Credit), a company incorporated in Hong Kong. The Company
attempts to assist the SMEs which are recently established and at an early stage of operations, but will not participate in board
of the SMEs or making business decision. The primary purpose behind focusing on providing services to companies at this early
stage of development will be for the Company to establish and nurture long-term relationships with clients during their growth
and development.  

On
August 5, 2016, Gushen Holding acquired 100% equity interest of Gushen Credit Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, for
a cash consideration of $0.13. Gushen Credit Limited has obtained a Money Lender License by Hong Kong Licensing Court for a period
of 12 months commencing from December 3, 2015 and is authorized to carry on money lending business in Hong Kong under the Hong
Kong Money Lender Ordinance (Chapter 163 of the Laws of Hong Kong). Mr. Huang Pin Lung, the director of the Company, is the sole
stockholder and director of Gushen Credit. The merger of Gushen Credit into Gushen Holding, which has nominal net assets, is considered
to be acquisition transactions under common control. For accounting purpose, Gushen, Inc., the holding company of Gushen Holding,
presents consolidated financial statements as of the beginning of the period as though the acquisition had occurred at the beginning
of the period. Financial statements of all prior periods are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. No goodwill
was recognized for these acquisition transactions under common control.  

Gushen,
Inc. and its subsidiaries are herein after referred to as the  Company .  

NOTE
3 - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business
for the foreseeable future.  

As
of October 31, 2016, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $605,015 and incurred a continuous net operating loss of $350,303
for the six months ended October 31, 2016. Although the Company has generated revenues from its money lending services, the Company s
cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s daily operations. The continuation of the Company as
a going concern through April 30, 2017 is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from
its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet
the Company s obligations as they become due.  

These
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going
concern.

NOTE
4 -  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as
described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.  

Basis
of presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ( US GAAP ).  

Basis
of consolidation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of estimates   

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those
estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
in the balance sheet, and the reported revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.  

Plant
and equipment  
 
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is
calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational.   

Categories     
       
      Expected
useful life    
 
      Furniture, fixtures, and office equipment  
       
      5 years   
 
      Leasehold improvement  
       
      5 years   

Cash
and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.  

Loans
receivables   

Loans
receivables primarily represent loan amount due from customers. Loans receivables are recorded at unpaid principal balances and
net of an allowance that reflects the Company s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. As of October 31,
2016, the loans receivables portfolio consists of personal loans.  

Allowance
for loan losses   

Management s
policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated probable incurred losses in the
loan portfolio. The loan loss allowance is a valuation allowance established to provide for estimated incurred credit losses in
the portfolio of loans at the balance sheet. The Company may incur losses in connection with loans if borrowers fail to pay their
monthly loan payments. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries and is decreased
by charged-off loans. When the loans become uncollectible, a charge-off will be recorded by reducing both loan balance (credit)
and allowance for loan losses (debit).  

The
Company provides for incurred losses on loans with an allowance for loan losses in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
310-10   Receivables   ( ASC310-10 ). A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events,
it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016  

  (Currency expressed in United States Dollars ( US$ ))  

  (Unaudited)  

An
insignificant delay or insignificant shortfall in amount of payments does not require application of this Statement. A loan is
not impaired during a period of delay in payment if the creditor expects to collect all amounts due including interest accrued
at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay.   

The
allowance for loan losses, which management evaluates on a periodic basis, represents an estimate of potential credit losses inherent
in the portfolio and is based on a variety of factors, including the composition and quality of the loan portfolio, delinquency
levels and trends, indication of credit deterioration, deterioration of the fair value of the loan collateral and the inability
of the borrower to provide additional collateral to make up for the shortfall.   

Determining
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subjective, complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain.   

For
the six months ended October 31, 2016, there was no provision for allowance for loan losses.  

Revenue
recognition   

In
accordance with the Accounting Standard Codification Topic 605  Revenue Recognition  ( ASC 605 ), the
Company recognizes revenue when the following four criteria are met: (1) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (2) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (3) there are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related
accounts receivable is probable.  

(a)     Loan
                                         interest income     

The
Company uses the effective interest method to recognize income on loans. Interest on loans is comprised largely of interest and
late fees on loans. Interest income is recognized based upon the amount of loans outstanding and their contractual interest rate.
Late fees are recognized when billable to the customer. Interest income is accrued and recorded in the consolidated statement
of operations as earned. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when any portion of scheduled loan principal or interest payments
is impaired, or earlier, when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of outstanding principal or interest. When loans
are placed on non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest
income. Income on non-accrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash is received. Loans are written off when
deemed uncollectible. Loans return to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are anticipated to be fully
collectible on a timely basis.  

(b)    Service
                                         income    

Revenue
from the provision of IT consulting and support service based upon the customer s specifications. The services are billed
either on a fixed-fee basis or on a time-and-material basis. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue when services are performed
and accepted by the customers.  

Cost
of revenues   

Cost
of revenues represented the purchase costs of computer hardware for re-sale to customer and subcontractor fee for loans collection  

Income
taxes   

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC Topic 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized
in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
facts.  

The
Company did not have any unrecognized tax positions or benefits and there was no effect on the financial condition or results
of operations for the six months ended October 31, 2016. The Company and its subsidiary are subject to local and foreign tax jurisdictions.
The Company s tax returns remain open subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.  

Net
loss per share   

The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260  Earnings per share . Basic loss per share
is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss
per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional
common shares were dilutive.

Foreign
currencies translation   

  Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting
exchange differences are recorded in the statements of operations.   

  The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars ( US$ ) and the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company s subsidiary in Seychelles and Hong Kong also maintain its
books and record in US$.   

   Related
parties    

  Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly,
to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions.
Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.   

   Fair
value of financial instruments:    

  The
carrying value of the Company's financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, loans receivables, prepayment, deposits, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities and amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature
of these financial instruments.   

  The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:   

Level
    1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;   

Level
2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and   

Level
                                                                     3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own  assumptions.   
 
   Recent
accounting pronouncements    

  The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.   

   NOTE

Company
Overview  

Gushen,
Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 9, 2015. Gushen is a development
stage company that intends to provide managerial, capital and IT support to start-ups companies as well as small and medium enterprises
( SMEs ) to assist them in their early stages of operations as they expand and grow their own company.  

Gushen
Inc. is a holding company which operates exclusively through its wholly owned subsidiary, Gushen Holding Limited. Gushen Holding
Limited was incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles, however at this time any and all physical operations take place in Hong
Kong. Gushen Inc. shares the same business plan as Gushen Holding Limited and any reference to one or the other is synonymous
when referencing the business plan or plan of operations.  

Gushen
attempts to assist companies that are just getting off the ground and that are at an early stage of operations, but will not rule
out business that are a little further along. The primary purpose behind focusing on companies at this early stage of development
will be for Gushen, Inc. to establish and nurture long-term lasting relationships with our clients as they grow and develop. Gushen
will initially target companies located in Hong Kong.  

As
mentioned in our Form S-1, the Company intends to assist any future clients through various methods beyond just capital support,
although that may be included. On August 5, 2016, Gushen Holding Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gushen Inc., acquired 100%
equity interest of Gushen Credit Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, for a cash consideration of $0.13. The purchase
price is determined based on the mutual agreement between Gushen Holding Limited and Gushen Credit Limited, which is believed
to be beneficial to both parties. Gushen Holding Limited funded the cash consideration through its own working capital. Mr. Huang
Pin Lung, the director of the Company, is the sole stockholder and director of Gushen Credit Limited.  

Gushen
Credit Limited, which was incorporated on June 29, 2015 and granted a Money Lenders License by Hong Kong Licensing Court for a
period of 12 months from the 3rd day of December 2015, is allowed to carry on money lending business in Hong Kong. Gushen Credit
Limited is an authorized financial company incorporated under the Hong Kong Money Lender Ordinance (Chapter 163 of the Laws of
Hong Kong). With the use of a web-based loan management system and credit system, Gushen Credit Limited provides a full range
of flexible and diversified quality money lending services to customers, including SME financing, mortgage loan and personal loan
to help resolve customers  financial needs. In the future, the Company expects to shift the business to focus on money lending
activities and to generate income from provision of various loan services to financially support clients.  

Results
of Operation   

For
the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015   

Revenue   

For
the three and six months ended October 31, 2016, we earned loan interest income of $10,079 and $14,134 respectively from our money
lending business in Hong Kong. For the three and six months ended October 31, 2015, we had revenue amount of $3,800 which mainly
represented the provision of IT consulting and support service based upon the customer s specifications.   

General
and administrative expenses   

We
incurred a total of $176,347 and $360,953 general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016
respectively. The general and administrative expenses are mainly comprised of rent and rates, salary and bonus, and building management
fee. The Company expects operating expenses to increase when the money lending business starts to expand. For the three and six
months ended October 31, 2015, we incurred a total of $47,662 and $60,223 general and administrative expenses, which are mainly
comprised of rent and rates, salary and bonus, and building management fee.  

Net
loss   

For
the three and six months ended October 31, 2016, we incurred a total net loss of $169,752 and $350,303 respectively. For the three
and six months ended October 31, 2015, we incurred a total net loss of $45,662 and $58,223, respectively. The increases in net
loss is mainly attributed to the general and administrative expenses incurred for the commencement of money lending business.  

Loans
to customers and loans receivable   

The
following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan to customers.  

For
the three months and six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company has provided loans to customers. The loans to customers carry
interest rate ranging from 36% to 51% per annum with credit terms mutually agreed with the customers. The Group has not made impairment
on these loans to customers because, in the opinion of directors of the Company, it is probable the Company is able to collect
all outstanding amounts and there is no significant change in credit quality of the customers.   

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Operating
Activities    

Net
cash used in operating activities was $404,231 for the six months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to net cash used in operating
activities of $76,715 for the six months ended October 31, 2015. The cash used in operating activities for the six months ended
October 31, 2016 was a result of our net loss of $350,303 attributable to the general and administrative expenses incurred and
the increase in deposits of $77,591. The substantial increase in net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended
October 31, 2016 was due to the business operation of the subsidiary.  

Investing
Activities    

For
the six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the cash used in investing activities was $156,808 and $385 respectively, which
was mainly attributed to the purchase of plant and equipment. The substantial increase in net cash used in investing activities
for the six months ended October 31, 2016 was due to the leasehold improvement on the office premises of the Company.  

Financing
Activities    

For
the six months ended October 31, 2016, the net cash used in financing activities was $1,073,998 which was mainly attributed to
the repayment to a director of the Company. For the six months ended October 31, 2015, the net cash provide in financing
activities was $69,964, which was mainly attributed to the advances from a director of the Company.  

Going
Concern  

As
of October 31, 2016, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $605,015 and incurred a continuous net operating loss of $350,303
for the six months ended October 31, 2016. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern
and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable
or settlement values. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty  

Off-balance
                                         Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that are material to our stockholders as of October 31, 2016.  

Item
3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

Item
4 Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:     

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of October 31, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of October 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude
that, as of October 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties
and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with
respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the six months ended October 31, 2016, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II -- OTHER INFORMATION

or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any beneficial shareholder
are an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to us.
