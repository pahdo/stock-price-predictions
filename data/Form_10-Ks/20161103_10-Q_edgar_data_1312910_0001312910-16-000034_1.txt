(1) Organization 
    
   ICON Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC (the  LLC ) was formed on December 2, 2004 as a Delaware limited liability company. When used in these notes to consolidated financial statements, the terms  we,   us,   our  or similar terms refer to the LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
   We operated as an equipment leasing and finance program in which the capital our members invested was pooled together to make investments, pay fees and establish a small reserve. We primarily acquired equipment subject to lease, purchased equipment and leased it to third parties, provided equipment and other financing and, to a lesser degree, acquired ownership rights to items of leased equipment at lease expiration. 
     
   Our manager is ICON Capital, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the  Manager ). Our Manager manages and controls our business affairs, including, but not limited to, the equipment leases and other financing transactions that we entered into, pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated limited liability company agreement (the  LLC Agreement ). 
    
   Our operating period ended on April 30, 2014 after having been extended for   two   years.  On May 1, 2014, we commenced our liquidation period. During our liquidation period, we have sold and will continue to sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business. Our liquidation period will continue if the sale of our remaining assets is not in the best interests of our members taking into account, among other things, current market conditions. 

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.  In the opinion of our Manager, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-01,   Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items   ( ASU 2015-01 ), which simplifies income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. We adopted ASU 2015-01 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ), which modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis by reducing the frequency of application of related party guidance and excluding certain fees in the primary beneficiary determination. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), requiring revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for goods and services. This new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Deferral of the Effective Date   ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Under such deferral, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period.

Early adoption is permitted, but not before our original effective date of January 1, 2017. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ), which provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 becomes effective for us on our fiscal year ending after December 31, 2016, and all subsequent annual and interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In November 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ), which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on a classified balance sheet. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. ASU 2015-17 may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ), which provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which modifies the measurement of credit losses by eliminating the probable initial recognition threshold set forth in current guidance, and instead reflects an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-13 through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.     
    
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The adoption of ASU 2016-15 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-15 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements. 

(3)  Investment in Joint Ventures       
    
  On May 15, 2013, a joint venture owned   39%   by us,   21%   by ICON Leasing Fund Twelve, LLC ( Fund Twelve ) and   40%   by ICON ECI Fund Fifteen, L.P., each an entity also managed by our Manager, purchased a portion of a   $208,038,290   subordinated credit facility for Jurong Aromatics Corporation Pte. Ltd. ( JAC ) from Standard Chartered Bank for   $28,462,500  . The subordinated credit facility initially bore interest at rates ranging between   12.5%   and   15.0%   per year and matures in January 2021. As a result of JAC s failure to make an expected payment that was due to the joint venture during the three months ended March 31, 2015, the interest rate payable by JAC under the facility increased from   12.5%   to   15.5%  . The subordinated credit facility is secured by a second priority security interest in all JAC s assets, which include, among other things, all equipment, plant and machinery associated with a condensate splitter and aromatics complex. Our initial contribution to the joint venture was   $11,100,376  .

During 2015, JAC experienced liquidity constraints as a result of a general economic slow-down in China and India, which led to lower demand from such countries, as well as the price decline of energy and other commodities. As a result, JAC s manufacturing facility ceased operations and JAC was not able to service interest payments under the facility. In addition, an expected tolling arrangement with JAC s suppliers that would have allowed JAC s manufacturing facility to resume operations did not commence in 2015 as originally anticipated. Discussions among the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan ended as the senior lenders did not agree to amendments to their credit facilities as part of the broader restructuring that was being contemplated. As a result, JAC entered receivership on September 28, 2015. 
  As a result of these factors, during the three months ended   June 30, 2015  , our Manager determined that there was doubt regarding the joint venture s ultimate collectability of the facility and commenced recording credit losses. During the three months ended   June 30, 2015  , the joint venture recorded a credit loss of   $17,342,915  , of which our share was   $6,421,994  . Commencing with the three months ended   June 30, 2015   and on a quarterly basis thereafter, our Manager had reassessed the collectability of the facility by considering the following factors, among others (i) what a potential buyer may be willing to pay to acquire JAC based on a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples and (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries. During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the joint venture recorded an aggregate credit loss of   $31,637,426   related to JAC based on our Manager s quarterly collectability analyses, of which our share was   $11,996,247  . Our Manager also assessed impairment under the equity method of accounting for our investment in the joint venture and concluded that there was no impairment. 
  In January 2016, our Manager engaged in further discussions with JAC s other subordinated lenders and the Receiver regarding a near term plan for JAC s manufacturing facility. Based upon such discussions, our Manager anticipated that a   one  -year tolling arrangement with JAC s suppliers would be implemented to allow JAC s facility to recommence operations. In July 2016, the tolling arrangement was finally implemented and the manufacturing facility resumed operations. Although our Manager believes that the marketability of JAC s facility should improve now that it has recommenced operations, our Manager does not anticipate that JAC will make any payments to the joint venture while operating under the tolling arrangement. As part of the tolling arrangement and the receivership process, JAC incurred additional senior debt, which could be up to   $55,000,000  , to fund its operations as well as any receivership-related costs. As a result, our Manager determined that the joint venture s ultimate collectability of the facility was further in doubt. As of   June 30, 2016  , our Manager updated its quarterly assessment by considering (i) a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples; (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries and (iii) the additional senior debt incurred by JAC, which has priority over the joint venture s facility. Based upon this reassessment, our Manager determined that the joint venture should fully reserve the outstanding balance of the facility due from JAC as of   June 30, 2016  . As a result, the joint venture recorded an additional credit loss of $  5,365,776   for the three months ended   June 30, 2016  , of which our share was $  2,092,652  . Our Manager continues to closely monitor the operations of JAC and the receivership process through regular communications with certain other stakeholders. The joint venture did not recognize finance income for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the joint venture recognized finance income of   $0   and   $1,152,580  , respectively, prior to the facility being considered impaired. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total net investment in notes receivable held by the joint venture was   $0   and   $5,365,776  , respectively, and our total investment in the joint venture was   $0   and   $2,098,529  , respectively. 
  Information as to the results of operations of this joint venture is summarized as follows: 

(4) Income Taxes 
  We are taxed as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. Therefore,   no   provision for federal and state income taxes has been recorded since the liability for these taxes is the responsibility of each of the individual members rather than us. However, certain of our direct and indirect wholly-owned Canadian subsidiaries are unlimited liability companies and are taxed

as corporations under the laws of Canada. Other indirect wholly-owned Barbados subsidiaries are taxed as corporations in Barbados. There was   no   income tax expense or benefit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Under the laws of Canada, our Canadian subsidiaries are subject to income tax examination for the 2011 tax year and subsequent tax years. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset of CAD   2,608,818    and CAD   2,606,811  , respectively, (translated to USD as of the respective balance sheet dates) in relation to unused net operating losses. We believe it is more likely than not that our wholly-owned subsidiaries, ICON Teal Jones, LLC and ICON Teal Jones, ULC, will not realize this deferred tax asset. 

(5)  Transactions with Related Parties 
  We did not pay any distributions to our Manager for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We paid distributions to our Manager of $  0   and $  10,101   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Our Manager s interest in the net loss attributable to us was $  1,169   and $  49,430   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Our Manager s interest in the net loss attributable to us was $  36,253   and   $101,241   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Our Manager has waived the following fees and administrative expense reimbursements in relation to services provided during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(6)  Fair Value Measurements 
  Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
             
    Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 
                
    Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. 
                
    Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable and are supported by little or no market data. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value either on a recurring or nonrecurring basis.

Fair value information with respect to certain of our assets and liabilities is not separately provided since the carrying value of such financial assets and liabilities approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. 

(7)  Commitments and Contingencies 
  At the time we acquire or divest of our interest in an equipment lease or other financing transaction, we may, under very   limited circumstances, agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Our Manager believes that any liability of ours that may arise as a result of any such indemnification obligations may or may not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. 
  During 2008, ICON EAR, LLC ( ICON EAR ), a joint venture owned   45%   by us and   55%   by Fund Twelve, purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Equipment Acquisition Resources, Inc. ( EAR ) for   $15,729,500  . In addition, our wholly owned subsidiary, ICON EAR II, LLC ( ICON EAR II ), purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to EAR for a purchase price of   $6,347,500  . On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against ICON EAR and ICON EAR II (collectively, the  ICON EAR entities ) seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleged were fraudulently transferred from EAR to the ICON EAR entities. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to the ICON EAR entities during the   90  -day period preceding EAR s bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that the ICON EAR entities received as security in connection with their investment. Our Manager filed an answer to the complaint that included certain affirmative defenses. Since that time, substantial discovery was completed. Given the risks, costs and uncertainty surrounding litigation in bankruptcy, our Manager engaged in mediation with the trustee to resolve this matter, which resulted in a tentative settlement in May 2016 subject to bankruptcy court approval. On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement. The settlement released all claims against the ICON EAR entities, Fund Twelve and us for an aggregate settlement payment of   $3,100,000  . As a result, we recorded our proportionate share of the litigation settlement expense of   $1,891,000   during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The settlement amount was paid on July 15, 2016.  
  On January 4, 2012, MW Universal, Inc. ( MWU ) and certain of its subsidiaries satisfied their obligations relating to   two   of the   three   lease schedules. On August 20, 2012, we sold the automotive manufacturing equipment subject to lease with LC Manufacturing, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MWU ( LC Manufacturing ), and terminated warrants issued to us for aggregate proceeds of approximately   $8,300,000  . As a result, based on our   6.33%   ownership interest in ICON MW, LLC ( ICON MW ), our joint venture with Fund Twelve, we received proceeds in the amount of approximately   $525,000   and recognized a loss on the sale of approximately   $6,000  . In addition, our Manager evaluated the collectability of the personal guaranty of a previous owner of LC Manufacturing and, based on the findings, ICON MW recorded a credit loss of approximately   $5,411,000  , of which our portion was approximately   $343,000  . In February 2013, ICON MW commenced an action against the guarantor. On October 5, 2015, ICON MW received summary judgment against the guarantor on the issue of liability. A hearing to determine damages was held in July 2016. In September 2016, the Court Referee issued a report recommending a judgment in favor of ICON MW for (i)   $5,660,000   in damages; (ii)   $120,000   in attorney's fees; and (iii)   $540,000   in prejudgment interest. ICON MW filed a motion to confirm such report, which is currently pending. 
  In 2011, Kreif Group ( Kreif ) entered into an agreement with ICON French Equipment I, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary ( ICON French Equipment ), to acquire certain assets from ICON French Equipment. Subsequently, Kreif breached its purchase obligation to acquire such assets, which resulted in ICON French Equipment filing a legal claim against Kreif. In 2013, a court awarded ICON French Equipment    1,484,956   to be paid over a period of   10 years  . Gain on litigation will be recognized to the extent cash is received. To date, we have received   one   payment of    74,248   (USD   $82,298  ) on April 1, 2015.

Item 2.   Manager s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following is a discussion of our current financial position and results of operations.  This discussion should be read together with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. This discussion should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures below regarding  Forward-Looking Statements.  
    
  As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to  we,   us,   our  or similar terms include ICON Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Overview 
   We operated as an equipment leasing and finance program in which the capital our members invested was pooled together to make investments, pay fees and establish a small reserve. We primarily acquired equipment subject to lease, purchased equipment and leased it to third parties, provided equipment and other financing and, to a lesser degree, acquired ownership rights to items of leased equipment at lease expiration. Some of our equipment leases were acquired for cash and were expected to provide current cash flow, which we refer to as  income  leases. For our other equipment leases, we financed the majority of the purchase price through borrowings from third parties. We refer to these leases as  growth  leases. These growth leases generated little or no current cash flow because substantially all of the rental payments received from the lessee were used to service the indebtedness associated with acquiring or financing the lease. For these leases, we anticipated that the future value of the leased equipment would exceed our cash portion of the purchase price. 
    
   Our Manager manages and controls our business affairs, including, but not limited to, our equipment leases and other financing transactions, under the terms of our LLC Agreement. 
   Our operating period ended on April 30, 2014 after having been extended for two years. On May 1, 2014, we commenced our liquidation period. During our liquidation period, we have sold and will continue to sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business. Our liquidation period will continue if the sale of our remaining assets is not in the best interests of our members taking into account, among other things, current market conditions. 

Recent Significant Transaction 
  Notes Receivable 
  In connection with our investment in joint venture related to JAC, in January 2016, our Manager engaged in further discussions with JAC s other subordinated lenders and the Receiver regarding a near term plan for JAC s manufacturing facility. Based upon such discussions, our Manager anticipated that a one-year tolling arrangement with JAC s suppliers would be implemented to allow JAC s facility to recommence operations. In July 2016, the tolling arrangement was finally implemented and the manufacturing facility resumed operations. Although our Manager believes that the marketability of JAC s facility should improve now that it has recommenced operations, our Manager does not anticipate that JAC will make any payments to the joint venture while operating under the tolling arrangement. As part of the tolling arrangement and the receivership process, JAC incurred additional senior debt, which could be up to $55,000,000, to fund its operations as well as any receivership-related costs. As a result, our Manager determined that the joint venture s ultimate collectability of the facility was further in doubt. As of June 30, 2016, our Manager updated its quarterly assessment by considering (i) a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA  
  
   10 

     Table of contents  

multiples; (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries and (iii) the additional senior debt incurred by JAC, which has priority over the joint venture s facility. Based upon this reassessment, our Manager determined that the joint venture should fully reserve the outstanding balance of the facility due from JAC as of June 30, 2016. As a result, the joint venture recorded an additional credit loss of $5,365,776 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, of which our share was $2,092,652.  Our Manager continues to closely monitor the operations of JAC and the receivership process through regular communications with certain other stakeholders.  The joint venture did not recognize finance income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the joint venture recognized finance income of $0 and $1,152,580, respectively, prior to the facility being considered impaired. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total net investment in notes receivable held by the joint venture was $0 and $5,365,776, respectively, and our total investment in the joint venture was   $0   and   $2,098,529  , respectively.

Financing Transactions 
  During the   2016   Quarter and the   2015   Quarter, we did not recognize any finance income.      

Operating Lease Transaction 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not own any equipment subject to operating leases in our portfolio. During the 2016 Quarter, we did not recognize any rental income. During the   2015   Quarter, one customer generated all of our rental income as follows: 

Revenue and other income (loss) for the   2016   Quarter and the   2015   Quarter is summarized as follows: 

Total revenue and other income (loss) changed by   $1,687,605  , or   107.2%  , from a loss of   $1,573,934   in the   2015   Quarter to income of   $113,671   in the   2016   Quarter. The change was primarily due to no credit loss recorded during the   2016   Quarter as compared to the credit loss recorded during the   2015   Quarter by our joint venture related to JAC (see  Recent Significant Transaction  above) and an increase in other revenue as a result of insurance proceeds that we received during the 2016 Quarter.  Rental income decreased as a result of the expiration of our lease with Murray Energy Corporation and certain of its affiliates (collectively,  Murray ) subsequent to the   2015   Quarter.  
    
  Expenses for the   2016   Quarter and the   2015   Quarter are summarized as follows: 

Total expenses for the   2016   Quarter decreased   $1,749,187  , or   88.4%  , as compared to the   2015   Quarter. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in (i) depreciation expense as a result of the sale of equipment previously on lease to Murray in October 2015 and (ii) general and administrative expenses primarily due to lower audit and legal fees incurred in the 2016 Quarter as compared to the 2015 Quarter.   
    
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased   $71,729  , from   $71,729   in the   2015   Quarter to   $0   in the   2016   Quarter. The decrease was the result of the expiration of our lease with Murray subsequent to the   2015   Quarter. 
    
  Net Loss Attributable to Fund Eleven 
    
  As a result of the foregoing factors, net loss attributable to us for the   2016   Quarter and the   2015   Quarter was   $116,820   and   $3,625,341  , respectively. Net loss attributable to us per weighted average additional share of limited liability company interests ( Share ) outstanding for the   2016   Quarter and the   2015   Quarter was   $0.32   and   $9.90  , respectively. 

Results of Operations for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   (the    2016   Period ) and   2015   (the    2015   Period )

Financing Transactions 
  During the   2016   Period and the   2015   Period, we did not recognize any finance income.                           
    
  Non-performing Assets within Financing Transaction 
    
  As of December 31, 2014, we had a net investment in notes receivable related to ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. ( ZIM ) totaling $5,350,503, which was accounted for on a non-accrual basis, and an accrued obligation on the seller s credits to ZIM in the same amount. On January 19, 2015, we entered into a letter of mutual release with ZIM to release and discharge ZIM s obligation on our notes receivable as well as our accrued obligation on the seller s credits in the same amount. For the   2015   Period, no finance income was recognized as a result of the notes receivable being accounted for on a non-accrual basis.

Revenue and other income (loss) for the   2016   Period and the   2015   Period is summarized as follows: 

Total revenue and other income (loss) changed by   $1,627,096  , or   45.0%  , from a loss of   $3,619,323   in the   2015   Period to a loss of   $1,992,227   in the   2016   Period. The change was primarily due to a lower credit loss recorded during the   2016   Period as compared to the   2015   Period by our joint venture related to JAC (see  Recent Significant Transaction  above) and an increase in other revenue as a result of insurance proceeds that we received during the 2016 Period. Rental income decreased as a result of the expiration of our lease with Murray subsequent to the   2015   Period. 
    
  Expenses for the   2016   Period and the   2015   Period are summarized as follows:

     Table of contents  

Total expenses for the   2016   Period decreased   $3,344,822  , or   53.2%  , as compared to the   2015   Period. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in (i) depreciation expense as a result of the sale of equipment previously on lease to Murray in October 2015 and (ii) general and administrative expenses primarily due to lower audit and legal fees incurred in the   2016   Period as compared to the 2015 Period. These decreases were partially offset by the recording of our share of the litigation settlement payment related to the ICON EAR entities during the   2016   Period. 
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased   $209,237  , from   $215,714   in the   2015   Period to   $6,477   in the   2016   Period. The decrease was primarily a result of the expiration of our lease with Murray subsequent to the   2015   Period. 
    
  Net Loss Attributable to Fund Eleven 
  As a result of the foregoing factors, net loss attributable to us for the   2016   Period and the   2015   Period was   $4,942,978   and   $10,124,133  , respectively. Net loss attributable to us per weighted average additional Share outstanding for the   2016   Period and the   2015   Period was   $13.49   and   $27.64  , respectively. 

Financial Condition 
          This section discusses the major balance sheet variances at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015  . 
  Total Assets 
  Total assets decreased   $5,224,645  , from   $5,885,335   at   December 31, 2015   to   $660,690   at   September 30, 2016  .  The decrease was primarily the result of (i) writing down our investment in joint venture related to JAC to zero as a result of the credit loss recorded by the joint venture, and (ii) the use of cash to pay our share of the litigation settlement related to the ICON EAR entities and other liabilities and operating expenses during the   2016   Period. 
  Current Assets 
  Current assets decreased   $3,126,116  , from   $3,786,806   at   December 31, 2015   to   $660,690   at   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was primarily due to the payment of our share of the litigation settlement related to the ICON EAR entities and other liabilities and operating expenses during the   2016   Period. 
  Total Liabilities 
  Total liabilities decreased   $273,954  , from   $581,126   at   December 31, 2015   to   $307,172   at   September 30, 2016  .  The decrease was due to the use of cash to pay certain liabilities during the   2016   Period. 
    
  Equity 
  Equity decreased   $4,950,691  , from   $5,304,209   at   December 31, 2015   to   $353,518   at   September 30, 2016  .  The decrease was primarily due to our net loss during the   2016   Period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Summary 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $511,948   and   $3,459,766  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our main use of cash was to pay our share of the litigation settlement related to the ICON EAR entities and other liabilities and operating expenses. During our remaining liquidation period, we expect our main source of cash will be from distributions from our joint venture, if any, and our main use of cash will be to pay operating expenses. Our liquidity will vary in the future, increasing to the extent proceeds from the sale of our remaining investment exceed expenses and decreasing as we pay distributions and to the extent that expenses exceed cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of our remaining investment. 
    
  We anticipate being able to meet our liquidity requirements into the foreseeable future using cash on hand as of   September 30, 2016  . Our ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that affect us and our borrower's business that are beyond our control. 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of our offering, we established a cash reserve in the amount of 0.5% of the gross offering proceeds. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we used the cash reserve to pay certain of our operating expenses.

     Table of contents  

As we previously indicated to our members, we experienced liquidity pressures in our portfolio after the U.S. economy entered into a recession in December 2007, coupled with our prior investment strategy that, among other things, relied significantly on third parties to originate investments, used a substantial amount of long-term debt to make investments, and was highly dependent on the residual value of equipment to achieve investment returns. As a result, we reduced our distribution rate from 9.1% per year to 4.0% per year effective January 1, 2011 through April 2012. We extended our operating period two years and did not pay any distributions during this extended operating period.  We commenced our liquidation period on May 1, 2014. While we believe that these actions taken by our Manager have improved our financial position, we will be unable to meet our investment objectives. 
  Cash Flows 
  Operating Activities 
  Cash flows from operating activities decreased   $6,898,268  , from a source of cash of   $3,975,626   in the   2015   Period to a use of cash of   $2,922,642   in the   2016   Period. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a decrease in rental receipts due to the expiration of an operating lease subsequent to the   2015   Period and (ii) the use of cash to pay our share of the litigation settlement related to the ICON EAR entities and other liabilities and operating expenses during the 2016 Period. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
   Cash used in investing activities decreased   $3,231  , from   $14,217   in the   2015   Period to   $10,986   in the   2016   Period. This decrease was due to the use of less cash to pay expenses on behalf of our joint venture related to JAC during the   2016   Period as compared to the   2015   Period. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
   Cash used in financing activities decreased   $2,883,411  , from   $2,897,601   in the   2015   Period to   $14,190   in the   2016   Period. This decrease was due to a decrease in distributions paid to our members and noncontrolling interests during the   2016   Period as compared to the   2015   Period. 
    
  Distributions 
    
  We, at our Manager s discretion, paid monthly distributions to our members and noncontrolling interests starting with the first month after each member s admission and the commencement of our joint venture operations, respectively.  During the   2016   Period, we paid distributions to our Manager, additional members and noncontrolling interests of   $0  ,   $0   and   $14,190  , respectively. Distributions paid during our liquidation period will vary, depending on the timing of the sale or the maturity of our remaining investment. 

Commitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  At the time we acquire or divest of our interest in an equipment lease or other financing transaction, we may, under very limited circumstances, agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Our Manager believes that any liability of ours that may arise as a result of any such indemnification obligations may or may not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. 
  During 2008, ICON EAR purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to EAR for $15,729,500. In addition, ICON EAR II purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to EAR for a purchase price of $6,347,500.  On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against the ICON EAR entities seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleged were fraudulently transferred from EAR to the ICON EAR entities. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to the ICON EAR entities during the 90-day period preceding EAR s bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that the ICON EAR entities received as security in connection with their investment. Our Manager filed an answer to the complaint that included certain affirmative defenses. Since that time, substantial discovery was completed. Given the risks, costs and uncertainty surrounding litigation in bankruptcy, our Manager engaged in mediation with the trustee to resolve this matter, which resulted in a tentative settlement in May 2016 subject to bankruptcy court approval. On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement. The settlement released all claims against the ICON EAR entities, Fund Twelve and us for an  
  
   15 

     Table of contents  

aggregate settlement payment of $3,100,000. As a result, we recorded our proportionate share of the litigation settlement expense of $1,891,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The settlement amount was paid on July 15, 2016.   
    
  On January 4, 2012, MWU and certain of its subsidiaries satisfied their obligations relating to two of the three lease schedules. On August 20, 2012, we sold the automotive manufacturing equipment subject to lease with LC Manufacturing and terminated warrants issued to us for aggregate proceeds of approximately $8,300,000. As a result, based on our 6.33% ownership interest in ICON MW, we received proceeds in the amount of approximately $525,000 and recognized a loss on the sale of approximately $6,000. In addition, our Manager evaluated the collectability of the personal guaranty of a previous owner of LC Manufacturing and, based on the findings, ICON MW recorded a credit loss of approximately $5,411,000, of which our portion was approximately $343,000. In February 2013, ICON MW commenced an action against the guarantor. On October 5, 2015, ICON MW received summary judgment against the guarantor on the issue of liability. A hearing to determine damages was held in July 2016. In September 2016, the Court Referee issued a report recommending a judgment in favor of ICON MW for (i)   $5,660,000   in damages; (ii)   $120,000   in attorney's fees; and (iii)   $540,000   in prejudgment interest. ICON MW filed a motion to confirm such report, which is currently pending. 
    
  In 2011, Kreif entered into an agreement with ICON French Equipment to acquire certain assets from ICON French Equipment.  Subsequently, Kreif breached its purchase obligation to acquire such assets, which resulted in ICON French Equipment filing a legal claim against Kreif.  In 2013, a court awarded ICON French Equipment  1,484,956 to be paid over a period of 10 years.  Gain on litigation will be recognized to the extent cash is received.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
    
  In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our Manager carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the management of our Manager, including its Co-Chief Executive Officers and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Manager s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on the foregoing evaluation, the Co-Chief Executive Officers and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that our Manager s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  In designing and evaluating our Manager s disclosure controls and procedures, our Manager recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our Manager s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Disclosure controls and procedures cannot detect or prevent all error and fraud. Some inherent limitations in disclosure controls and procedures include costs of implementation, faulty decision-making, simple error and mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all anticipated and unanticipated future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with established policies or procedures. 
    
  Evaluation of internal control over financial reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
