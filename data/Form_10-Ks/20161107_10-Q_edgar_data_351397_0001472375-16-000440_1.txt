  STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
  FOR THE QUARTER ENDING 
  September 30, 2016  
  (UNAUDITED) 

Item 2:  
                Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial                 Condition and Results of Operations  
  
 The partnership does not conduct any operations.  Income is booked when royalties      or fees only at such time are paid to the partnership.  
 No royalties or other income were booked in the third  quarter of 2016. 
  The partnership originally had licensed the manufacturing and sale  of its products to Detonics Manufacturing Corporation (DMC) a  subsidiary of Energy Sciences Corporation, (ESC).  DMC, ESC and  the Partnership entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings on April  29, 1986.  In late 1987, the Bankruptcy Court approved a sale of  all of DMC's assets to a new entity, formed by outside third  parties, called New Detonics Manufacturing Corporation, (NDMC).  By subsequent majority vote of the limited partners of the  Partnership, a new license was entered into between the  Partnership and NDMC, which called for royalties to begin in late  1991 at the rate of 4% of gross sales.  No partnership income was  expected before that time. 
  On May 13, 1988, ESC's bankruptcy was dismissed and all remaining assets were repossessed by the sole secured creditor of ESC, the firm of Murphy   Elgot.  These assets are primarily amounts owed to ESC by the partnership and the rights to produce products owned by the partnership.  The general partners had discussions with Mr. Murphy, (who was also counsel for ESC and the partnerships), on the elimination of most or all the debt owed by the Partnership to ESC, (and, therefor to Murphy   Elgot).  
 As previously reported, the general partners learned in late 1991 that production of firearms at NDMC was suspended in 1991. The general partners have subsequently been advised that Murphy   Elgot, the sole secured creditors of the original DMC, have moved to have the "soft" assets (the name "Detonics" and the right to manufacture the Detonics designs) which were assigned to NDMC by the Bankruptcy Court be returned to Murphy   Elgot and Moore. This occured in September 1992. Mr. Murphy passed away in 1997. The general partners have had discussions with Mr. Elgot regarding future attempts to recommercialize the products and he indicated he would approve any recommercialization plan that the general partners would be able to obtain. The general partners had been discussing such plans with a third party, Mr.Jerry Ahern. Royalty amounts of 5% of gross sales had been verbally agreed to, but no written agreement had been prepared or signed as of December 31, 2002. It was learned in April 2003 that this plan would not take place. Mr. Ahern continued to explore other financing sources and the partnership signed a three year agreement with Mr. Ahern giving him the exclusive right to seek funding or a partner to reestablish production.  
  Mr. Ahern was successful in finding a backer and a new company  named Detonics USA LLC was formed (not owned by the partnership)  The partnership signed a license agreement with Detonics USA  LLC which involves a royalty of about 5% of gross sales of each of  the partnership's products manufactured and sold, appropriately  divided among all the firearms partnerships and shared with Mark  Elgot and Richard Moore in the ratio of 35% to Elgot and Moore  combined and 65% to the partnership(s) whose products have been  sold.  
 Detonics USA was subsequently purchased by Double Nickel LLC in late 2007 and operates as a division of that company and has been renamed Detonics Defence Technologies. The partnership payments have been changed to a flat $25.00 per Detonics/1911 style gun sold and $5.00 per non-Detonics gun sold. The split between the partnership and Mark Elgot and Richard Moore remains the same 65%/35%. There can be no assurance that Double Nickel will succeed and that royalties/fees will be paid.   
 Parts are being manufactured by Detonics Defense Technologies.  
 Sid Woodcock, the co-General Partner of the partnership, who was involved solely in early stage technical design and production matters, passed away in June 2011 at age 87. Michel Maes is now sole General Partner of the partnership. He is a co-owner of an electronics company and is not a stock holder and does not play any role in the Double Nickel, dba Detonics Defense Technologies. 
  
  Item 3:  
                Market Risk  
  
 The partnership's units are not tradeable and no market exists for them. 
The units can be transfered to or from family trusts or by inheritence.
