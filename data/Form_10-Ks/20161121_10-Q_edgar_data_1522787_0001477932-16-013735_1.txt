Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are not historical facts. Because they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking statements may include words such as  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   intend,   could,   should,   would,   may,   seek,   plan,   might,   will,   expect,   anticipate,   predict,   project,   forecast,   potential,   continue  negatives thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, are based on various underlying assumptions and current expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievement to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.     We cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that the results or conditions described in such statements or that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are found at various places throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and include information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations, including statements about potential acquisition or merger targets; business strategies; future cash flows; financing plans; plans and objectives of management; any other statements regarding future acquisitions, future cash needs, future operations, business plans and future financial results, and any other statements that are not historical facts.     These forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time than we have described. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.     Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or otherwise.      CERTAIN TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT      All references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the terms  we ,  our ,  us , the  Company ,  Cyberfort  and the  Registrant  refer to Cyberfort Software, Inc. unless the context indicates another meaning.

     Table of Contents          Cyberfort Software, Inc     Notes to Financial Statements     (Unaudited)         NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION      On September 26, 2016, the board of Directors and the majority shareholders of the Patriot Berry Farms, Inc. approved an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to change its name from Patriot Berry Farms, Inc to Cyberfort Software, Inc. The name change has been affected prior to the filing of this report. Cyberfort Software, Inc., ( Cyberfort  or the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 2010 under the name of Gaia Remedies, Inc. The main focus of the Company is the development of security software technology. This will result in a total rebranding and change in industry sector which the Company operates.      NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       BASIS OF PRESENTATION      Interim Accounting     The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three month period and six month period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended March 31, 2017.     The Company's 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, filed on September 7, 2016, should be read in conjunction with this Report.       USE OF ESTIMATES      The preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include, where applicable, disclosures of estimates, assumptions, uncertainties and markets that could affect the financial statements and future operations of the Company.      CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS      Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with original maturities of less than three months, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value. The Company had $3,968 and $0 in cash as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.                 8       
     Table of Contents          Cyberfort Software, Inc    Notes to Financial Statements    (Unaudited)         NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $3,736,686 and $2,569,399, respectively. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the next twelve months.     The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing. In response to this and other potential problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.      NOTE 4 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS      On September 20, 2016, the Company entered into an Assignment Agreement with Ferlin Corp. to assume a Purchase and Sale Agreement between Ferlin Corp and Mistrin Pty, Ltd. that results in the Company effectively purchasing the title, rights, and interest to a software application, (including the source code) in exchange for various consideration. Under the Assignment and the assumed Purchase and Sale Agreement with Mistrin, the Company has assumed a Note Payable to Mistrin for $150,000, will issue 10,688,588 shares of common stock, valued at $0.085 per share, to the seller, assignor, and various individuals, and received $40,000. Consequently, the Company has recorded intangible property related to the transaction of $1,018,530. The Company has not fully issued all the required shares of common stock at this time. They will issue the shares as soon as practicable. However, the Company has treated all shares as issued and outstanding within these financial statement.     Per the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company was required to make a $50,000 payment related to the assumed Note Payable on September 25, 2016. As of the date of this filing the Company has yet to make the required payment and is in Material Breach of said agreement. Additionally, the Purchase and Sale Agreement obligates the Company to hire several identified individuals, fund $10,000 of marketing and development cost per month, and migrate the acquired technology into an Enterprise Class security software product prior to being able to begin the effort of generating revenue. The Company is in negotiations with the Assignor and Seller to amend the various agreements to enable the Company to raise additional funds in order for the Company to accomplish the execution of its current business plan. There are no guarantees that the Company will be able to renegotiate the agreements, raise the required funds, or successfully execute its business plan.     Consequently, the Company has determined that the newly acquired intangible property s value is impaired as of September 30, 2016, due to the material breach and significant uncertainties related to its business plan and has written off the entire value of the intangible property at that date.                 9

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other reports filed by Cyberfort Systems, Inc. (the  Company ) from time to time with the SEC (collectively, the  Filings ) contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the Filings, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan,  or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including the risks relating to the Company s business, industry, and the Company s operations and results of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.     Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.     Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.      Overview      Cyberfort Software, Inc., formerly Patriot Berry Farms, Inc ( Cyberfort  or the  Company ). was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 2010 under the name of Gaia Remedies, Inc.). On December 27, 2012, a change in control occurred as a director of the Company purchased 54,400,000 shares of common stock of the Company. On January 28, 2013, the Company changed its name to Patriot Berry Farms, Inc.     On May 15, 2013, the Company began implementation of its new business plan: the acquisition and operation of established and profitable berry farms throughout the United States. The Company s main focus is on blueberry production with a secondary focus on strawberry and raspberry production.     In August, 2013, the Company hired a Director of Farming and entered into an agreement, wherein the Company will pay a fee of $5,000 per month to the director for a period of 24 months in exchange for assistance in identifying, underwriting, and negotiating the terms of potential farm acquisitions on the Company s behalf. Further, the director will assist the Company in the development of its operations and distribution, amongst other responsibilities. Upon the expiration of the initial 24 months of the director s agreement s term, the Company will ascertain if an increase in the monthly fee is warranted.     In November, 2013, the Company acquired the Morningstar Farm, an operational blueberry farm in Levy County, Florida.           On April 4, 2014, the Company, through Douglas Harmon, who was the Company s Farm Manager of the Morningstar Farm entered into the Sale Agreement with Dole Berry Company. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, Dole was acting as the exclusive sales agent of the Company to market and sell all of the blueberries produced by the Grower from the Farm for a period of five (5) harvest years beginning January 1, 2014 until December 31, 2018 unless terminated earlier. The Company received advances equal to $1.00 per pound of finished product weight each week minus receiving and handling charges, as well as 10% commission that was paid to Dole. The Company was due to pay to the Mr. Harmon a commission equal to 2% of the revenues from the sales of finished products, but has since made a settlement within the sale of the farm, which included this payment.      On April 23, 2015, the Company sold the Morningstar Farm to Douglas and Gail Harmon.     The Company is based in San Francisco, California, with principal executive offices located at 388 Market Street, Suite 1300, San Francisco, California 94111 and our telephone number is (415) 295 4507.      Plan of Operation      The company s overall plan is to identify and acquire potential technologies, positioning itself to deal with the various and increasing cyber threats through innovative protection technologies for mobile, personal and business tech devices, stretching across a number of the available platforms.      There has been a very limited activity within the Company since September 2014 due to the fact that the Company has not been able to secure the necessary financing to sustain its operations.       Results of Operations        For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        Revenues      During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not generate any revenues.      Expenses      We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $1,122,513 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $44,632 for the corresponding period in 2015. This is due to an impairment of intangible property of $1,018,513 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to same period in 2015.            Net Loss      We incurred a net loss of $1,122,513 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $44,632 for the corresponding period in 2015.        For the Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Six Months Ended September 30, 2015            Revenue      During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not generate any revenues.      Expenses      We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $1,167,287 during the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $97,565 for the corresponding period in 2015. This is mainly due to an impairment of intangible property of $1,018,530 during the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to same period in 2015.      Gain on settlement of debt      During the six months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had $12,000 in gain on settlement of debt.      Net Loss      We incurred a net loss of $1,167,287 during the six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $85,565 for the corresponding period in 2015.       Liquidity and Capital Resources      Since its inception, the Company has financed its cash requirements from the sale of common stock and advances from related party. Uses of funds have included activities to establish our business, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses.     We believe the Company will need additional resources to implement its strategic objectives in upcoming quarters. Due to our lack of operating history, however, our auditors have stated their opinion that there currently exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $3,736,686. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the next twelve months.     The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations. In response to this and other potential problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.            Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      The Company has no off-balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.       We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.         (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.       In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our Principal Executive Officer ( PEO ) and Principal Financial Officer ( PFO ) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our PEO and PFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.       (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.       There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.             PART II   OTHER INFORMATION        Item 1. Legal Proceedings.      We are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.       Item 1A. Risk Factors       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.      See Note 4 for information related to Convertible Notes Payable. Other than the information presented in Note 4, or those previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K, there were no unregistered sales of the Company s equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.      Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.      There has been no default in the payment of principal, interest, sinking or purchase fund installment, or any other material default, with respect to any indebtedness of the Company.       Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.       Not applicable.             Item 5. Other Information.       On September 20, 2016, the Company entered into an Assignment Agreement with Ferlin Corp., to assume a Purchase and Sale Agreement between Ferlin Corp and Mistrin Pty, Ltd. that results in the Company effectively purchasing the title, rights, and interest to a software application,(including the source code) in exchange for various consideration. Under the Assignment and the assumed Purchase and Sale Agreement with Mistrin, the Company has assumed a Note Payable to Mistrin for $150,000, will issue 10,688,588 shares of common stock to the seller, assignor, and various individual, and received $40,000. Consequently, the Company has recorded intangible property related to the transaction of $1,018,530.     Per the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company was required to make a $50,000 payment related to the assumed Note Payable on September 25, 2016. As of the date of this filing the Company has yet to make the required payment and is in Material Breach of said agreement. Additionally, the Purchase and Sale Agreement obligates the Company to hire several identified individuals, fund $10,000 of marketing and development cost per month, and migrate the acquired technology into an Enterprise Class security software product prior to being able to begin the effort of generating revenue. The Company is in negotiations with the Assignor and Seller to amend the various agreements to enable the Company to raise additional funds in order for the Company to accomplish the execution of its current business plan. There are not guarantees that the Company will be able to renegotiate the agreements, raise the required funds, or successfully execute its business plan.     Consequently, the Company has determined that the newly acquired intangible property s value is impaired as of September 30, 2016, due to the material breach and significant uncertainties related to its business plan and has written off the entire value of the intangible property at that date.     On September 28, 2016, the Company entered into four consulting agreements with consultants to act in the role of Technology Development Manager, Chief Technology Officer, Corporate Development Officer, and Advisory Director. The term of each agreement shall be one year and shall be a rolling contract until terminated or extended. The Company shall issue each consultant a total of 200,000 shares of common stock per annum to a total of 800,000 shares per annum.       On October 18, 2016, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada and changed its name from Patriot Berry Farms, Inc. to Cyberfort Software, Inc.      On November 15, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced the Company's name and symbol change and it effective November 16, 2016. The Company will trade under its new name, Cyberfort Software, Inc. under the symbol CYBF.             Item 6. Exhibits.
