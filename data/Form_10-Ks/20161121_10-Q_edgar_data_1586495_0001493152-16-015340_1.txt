BLOW   DRIVE INTERLOCK CORPORATION  

Note 1 - Organization and Nature of Business  

Blow   Drive Interlock ( the Company )
was incorporated on July 2, 2013 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including,
but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company markets and rents alcohol ignition interlock devices to DUI/DWI
offenders as part of their mandatory court or motor vehicle department programs. The Company has approval for its device in the
following states: California, Colorado, Kansas, New York, Tennessee, Arizona, Oregon, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Texas. 

In 2015, The Company formed BDI Manufacturing,
Inc., an Arizona corporation, which is a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of Blow   Drive Interlock Corporation. 

The Company markets, installs and monitors
a breath alcohol ignition interlock device (BAIID) called the BDI-747/1, which is a mechanism that is installed on the steering
column of an automobile and into which a driver exhales. The device in turn provides a blood-alcohol concentration analysis. If
the driver s blood-alcohol content is higher than a certain pre-programmed limit, the device prevents the ignition from engaging
and the automobile from starting. These devices are often required for use by DUI or DWI ( driving under the influence 
or  driving while intoxicated ) offenders as part of a mandatory court or motor vehicle department program. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the
Company began to license others to distribute the BDI-747/1 and provide services related to the device. The distributorships are
for specific geographical areas (either entire states or certain counties within states). The Company currently has entered into
four distributorship agreements. Under the distribution agreements the Company typically receives a onetime fee, and then is entitled
to receive a per unit registration fee and a per unit monthly fee for each BDI-747/1 unit the distributor has in inventory or on
the road beginning thirty (30) days after the distributor receives the unit. 

Since December 31, 2015, the Company has received
the monthly fees related to one distributor. In addition, the company has begun recognizing monthly fee income from units the Company
has installed into customer s vehicles 

Note 2   Basis of Presentation and
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared by the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America,
and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and reflect all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the Company. 

Going Concern  

The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to
a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The
Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as
a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $1,247,039. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.
If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease or reduce its operations. 

In order to continue as a going concern, the
Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. The Company will continue to raise funds through the sale
of its equity securities or issuance of notes payable to obtain additional operating capital. The Company is dependent upon its
ability, and will continue to attempt to secure additional equity and/or debt financing until the Company can earn revenue and
realize positive cash flow from its operations. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in earning revenue
and realizing positive cash flow from its operations. Without sufficient financing it would be unlikely that the Company will continue
as a going concern. 

BLOW   DRIVE INTERLOCK CORPORATION  

Based on the Company s current rate of
cash outflows, cash on hand and proceeds from the prior sale of equity securities and issuance of convertible notes, management
believes that its current cash will not be sufficient to meet the anticipated cash needs for working capital for the next 12 months.
The Company s plans with respect to its liquidity issues include, but are not limited to, the following: 

1)  
      Continue to issue restricted stock for compensation due to consultants and for its legacy accounts payable in lieu of cash payments; and   

2)  
      Seek additional capital to continue its operations as it rolls out its current products. The Company is currently evaluating additional debt or equity financing opportunities and may execute them when appropriate. However, there can be no assurances that the Company can consummate such a transaction, or consummate a transaction at favorable pricing.   

The ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually
secure other sources of financing and achieve profitable operations. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities
that might result from this uncertainty. 

Reclassifications  

Certain reclassifications have been made to
amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. All reclassifications have been applied consistently to
the periods presented. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue when earned
and related costs of sales and expenses when incurred. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605-10-S99,
 Revenue Recognition, Overall, SEC Materials  ( Section 605-10-S74 ). Section 605-10-S99 requires that four basic
criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred
or services rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Cost of revenue consists
of the cost of the purchased goods and labor related to the corresponding sales transaction. When a right of return exists, the
Company defers revenues until the right of return expires. The Company recognizes revenue from services at the time the services
are completed. 

Distributorships   

Revenue is recognized pursuant to ASC Topic
605,  Revenue Recognition  (ASC 605). Monthly per unit fee revenue is earned and recognized over the term of the contract
as support services are provided. Revenues from territory exclusivity are earned when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement,
delivery has occurred, the sales price has been determined and collectability has been reasonably assured. 

The Company enters into arrangements that include
multiple deliverables, which typically consist of the sale of exclusive distributorship territory rights, startup supplies package,
promotional material, three weeks of onsite training and ongoing monthly support services. The Company accounts for each material
element within an arrangement with multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting. Revenue is allocated to each unit of
accounting under the guidance of ASC Topic 605-25, Multiple-Element Revenue Arrangements, which provides criteria for separating
consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price
of a deliverable. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE )
if available, third-party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor third-party evidence
is available. The Company is required to determine the best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that
used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. The Company generally does not separately sell distributorships
or training on a standalone basis. Therefore, the Company does not have VSOE for the selling price of these units nor is third
party evidence available and thus management uses its best estimate of selling prices in their allocation of revenue to each deliverable
in the multiple element arrangement. 

BLOW   DRIVE INTERLOCK CORPORATION  

Monitoring fees on Company installed
units   

The Company rents units directly to customers
and installs the units in the customer s vehicles. The rental periods range from a few months to 2 years and include a combination
of down payments made by the customer and monthly payments paid under the agreements with the Company. Revenue is recognized from
these companies on the straight line basis over the term of the agreement. Amounts collected in excess of those earned are classified
as deferred revenue in the balance sheet, and amounts earned in excess of amounts collected are reflected in accounts receivable
in the balance sheet at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts  

The Company s accounts receivable primarily
consist of trade receivables. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts that is based on historical trends, customer
knowledge, any known disputes, and the aging of the accounts receivable balances combined with management s estimate of future
potential recoverability. Receivables are written off against the allowance after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed.
The Company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is adequate, but actual
write-offs could exceed the recorded allowance. 

Convertible Debt and Warrants Issued with
Convertible Debt  

Convertible debt is accounted for under the
guidelines established by ASC 470,  Debt with Conversion and Other Options  and ASC 740,  Beneficial Conversion Features .
The Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ) when convertible debt is issued with conversion features
at fixed or adjustable rates that are below market value when issued. If, however, the conversion feature is dependent upon a condition
being met or the occurrence of a specific event, the BCF will be recorded when the related contingency is met or occurs. The BCF
for the convertible instrument is recorded as a reduction, or discount, to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal
to the fair value of the conversion feature. The discount is then amortized to interest over the life of the underlying debt using
the effective interest method. 

The Company calculates the fair value of warrants
issued with the convertible instruments using the Black-Scholes valuation method, using the same assumptions used for valuing employee
options for purposes of ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation , except that the contractual life of the warrant
is used. Under these guidelines, the Company allocates the value of the proceeds received from a convertible debt transaction between
the conversion feature and any other detachable instruments (such as warrants) on a relative fair value basis. The allocated fair
value is recorded as a debt discount or premium and is amortized over the expected term of the convertible debt to interest expense. 

For modifications of convertible debt, the
Company recorded a modification that changes the fair value of an embedded conversion feature, including a BCF, as a debt discount
which is then amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. If modification is considered substantial (i.e.
greater than 10% of the carrying value of the debt), an extinguishment of debt is deemed to have occurred, resulting in the recognition
of an extinguishment gain or loss. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The Company utilizes ASC 820-10, Fair Value
Measurement and Disclosure, for valuing financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as
the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants as of the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring
fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most
observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability
and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect
the Company s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The guidance
establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices
in active markets; 

Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices
in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there
is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

BLOW   DRIVE INTERLOCK CORPORATION  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company did not have any level 3 assets or liabilities. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the derivative liabilities
are considered level 2 items. 

Net Income (Loss) Per Share  

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing
income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during
the period. 

Stock Based Compensation  

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation
in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718  Stock Compensation , which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock
purchases related to an employee stock purchase plan based on the estimated fair values. 

For non-employee stock-based compensation,
the Company applies FASB ASC Topic 505  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees , which requires stock-based compensation related
to non-employees to be accounted for based on the fair value of the related stock or options or the fair value of the services
on the grant date, whichever is more readily determinable in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. 

Concentrations  

All of the Company s ignition interlock
devices are purchased from one supplier in China. The loss of this supplier could have a material impact on the Company s
ability to timely obtain additional units. 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for its income taxes in
accordance with Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC 740, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes
the enactment date. 

The Company also follows ASC 740-10-25, which
provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized
in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 740,   Accounting for Income Taxes  .
ASC 740-10-25 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB and the International
Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU No. 2014-9,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which clarifies the principles
for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The
core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
and services. The ASU, as amended, is effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2017. Early adoption is not permitted under U.S. GAAP and retrospective application is permitted, but not required. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,
 Presentation of Financial Statement-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern , which provides guidance under U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote
disclosures. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The ASU is
effective for all entities and for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 is not expected to have a significant impact
on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

BLOW   DRIVE INTERLOCK CORPORATION  

In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance
related to the presentation of deferred income taxes. The guidance requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified
as non-current in a consolidated balance sheet. This guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2017 and is not expected to
materially impact financial position or net earnings. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting
standard on leasing. The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet,
and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early
adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that adopting this guidance will have on consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3   Furniture and Equipment  

Furniture and equipment consist of the following: 

Depreciation expense for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $16,041 and $32,971 and $972, and $1,655, respectively. 

Note 4   Accrued Expenses  

Accrued Expense consist of the following: 

Note 5 - Deferred revenue  

The Company classifies income as deferred until
the terms of the contract or time frame have been met within the Company s revenue recognition policy. As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 deferred revenue totaled $63,553 and 81,674, with $0, and $50,000, respectively, related to distributorship
agreements. The remaining deferred revenue relates to Company serviced ignition interlock monitoring customers. 

BLOW   DRIVE INTERLOCK CORPORATION  

Note 6   Notes Payable  

Notes payable consist of the following: 

Convertible note #1:  

On August 7, 2015, the Company entered into
an agreement with a third party non-affiliate and issued a 7.5% interest bearing convertible debenture for $15,000 due on August
7, 2017, with conversion features commencing after 180 days following the date of the note. Payments of interest only are due monthly
beginning September 2015. The loan is convertible at 70% of the average of the closing prices for the common stock during the five
trading days prior to the conversion date. In connection with this Convertible note payable, the Company recorded a $5,770 discount
on debt, related to the beneficial conversion feature of the note to be amortized over the life of the note or until the note is
converted or repaid. This note was bifurcated with the embedded conversion option recorded as a derivative liability at fair value
(See Note 8). On May 6, 2016 the note holder elected to convert $7,500 in principal into 30,000 shares of common stock. 

In connection with the issuance of the August
Convertible Note Payable, the Company issued a warrant on August 7, 2015 to purchase 30,000 shares of the Company s common
stock at a purchase price of $0.50 per share. The Black Scholes model was used in valuing the warrants in determining the relative
fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible note payable using the following inputs: Expected Term  
3 years, Expected Dividend Rate   0%, Volatility   100%, Risk Free Interest Rate -1.08%. The Company recorded an additional
$4,873 discount on debt, related to the relative fair value of the warrants issued associated with the note to be amortized over
the life of the note. 

Convertible note #2  

On November 24, 2015, the Company entered into
an agreement with an existing non-affiliated shareholder, and issued a 10% interest bearing convertible debenture for $50,000 due
on November 19, 2017. Payments of interest only are due monthly beginning December 2015. The loan is convertible at 70% of the
average of the closing prices for the common stock during the five trading days prior to the conversion date, but may not be converted
if such conversion would cause the holder to own more than 9.9% of outstanding common stock after giving effect to the conversion
(which limitation may be removed by the holder upon 61 days advanced notice to the company). In connection with this Convertible
Note Payable, the Company recorded a $32,897 discount on debt, related to the beneficial conversion feature of the note to be amortized
over the life of the note or until the note is converted or repaid. This note was bifurcated with the embedded conversion option
recorded as a derivative liability at fair value (See Note 7). As of September 30, 2016 this note has not been converted.

CORPORATION  

In connection with the issuance of the November
convertible note payable, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 80,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.80
per share. The warrant has an exercise period of two years from the date of issuance. The Black Scholes model was used in valuing
the warrants in determining the relative fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible note payable using
the following inputs: Expected Term   2 years, Expected Dividend Rate   0%, Volatility   100%, Risk Free Interest
Rate -.61%. The Company recorded an additional $13,783 discount on debt, related to the relative fair value of the warrants issued
associated with the note to be amortized over the life of the note.

Royalty note #3:  

On September 30, 2016,
the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the  LSA ) with Doheny Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ( Doheny ), under which Doheny agreed to loan up to $542,400 in two phases, to be used to acquire additional
parts and supplies to manufacture the Company s proprietary breath alcohol ignition interlock devices. Under the terms of
the LSA, the first phase will be a loan of up to $192,000 to acquire parts and supplies to manufacture 600 Devices; and the second
phase will be a loan of up to $350,400 to acquire parts and supplies to manufacture 1,000 Devices. 

The Phase 1 Loan was
funded in the amount of $192,000 by Doheny on September 30, 2016, upon which the Company forwarded the funds to its supplier on
or about October 5, 2016, in order to acquire parts and supplies to manufacture 600 Devices. Both the Phase 1 Loan and the Phase
2 Loan mature three years from the date of funding, and are at an interest rate of 25% per annum. The Company can prepay the Phase
1 Loan and the Phase 2 Loan (if applicable) at any time without penalty. In exchange for Doheny funding the Phase 1 Loan, the Company
issued Doheny a promissory note for $192,000 and also issued Doheny shares of common stock equal to 4.99% of the then-outstanding
common stock, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement. As a result, on or about October 7, 2016, the Company issued
Doheny 845,913 shares of common stock. If Doheny funds the Phase 2 Loan then the Company is obligated to issue Doheny that number
of additional shares of common stock that equals 5% of the then-outstanding common stock. Until the Company repays the Phase 1
Loan and the Phase 2 Loan, as applicable, Doheny has anti-dilution rights for the percentage of stock Doheny owns in the event
the Company issues additional shares of common stock during that period. The Company also entered into a Royalty Agreement with
Doheny, under which Doheny was granted perpetual royalty rights on all Devices when the Company has 500 or more Devices in service
whether leased to end users or distributors. The royalty amounts vary between $1 and $2 per Device depending on a variety of factors.
The Company recorded a debt discount of $192,000 related to the relative fair value of the issued shares associated with the Phase
1 note to be amortized over the life of the note. 

Subsequent to September
30, 2016, the Company has issued an additional 54,508 common shares in connection with the anti-dilution provisions of this note. 

Related party promissory note  

On February 16, 2014, the Company entered into
a note payable agreement with Laurence Wainer, the director, President and sole officer of the Company. The note was for a principal
balance of $160,000 and bears interest at 7.75% per annum. Principal and interest payments are due in 60 equal monthly installments
beginning in March 2014 of $3,205. The Company and Laurence Wainer entered into an additional agreement effective April 2014 suspending
loan repayments until January 2015. As of January 2015, the payments have resumed. 

BLOW   DRIVE INTERLOCK CORPORATION  

Note 7   Derivative Financial Instruments  

The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic
815-40, Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ( ASC Topic 815-40 ), under which convertible instruments, which contain
terms that protect holders from declines in the stock price, may not be exempt from derivative accounting treatment. As a result,
embedded conversion options (whose exercise price is not fixed and determinable) in convertible debt (which is not conventionally
convertible due to the exercise price not being fixed and determinable) are initially recorded as a liability and are revalued
at fair value at each reporting date using the Black Sholes Model. 

The Company has a $7,500 and a $50,000 convertible
note with variable conversion pricing outstanding at September 30, 2016. The following inputs were used in within the Black Sholes
Model to determine the initial relative fair value: Expected Term   .85 and 1.11 years, Expected Dividend Rate   0%,
Volatility   312%, Risk Free Interest Rate - 0.55%. 

The Company revalues these derivatives each
quarter using the Black Sholes Model. The change in valuation is accounted for as a gain or loss in derivative liability. The following
table describes the Derivative liability as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Note 8   Accrued Royalties Payable  

In connection with the Royalty Notes number
1 and 2 as discussed in Note 6 above the Company has estimated the royalties to be paid out in perpetuity. No payments are due
for royalties until February 2018 unless the Company hits certain sales milestones as set forth in the royalty agreements earlier. 

Note 9   Stockholders  Equity

Preferred Stock  

The Company s articles of incorporation
authorize the Company to issue up to 50,000,000 preferred shares of $0.001 par value, having preferences to be determined by the
Board of Directors for dividends, and liquidation of the Company s assets. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company had no preferred shares outstanding. 

Common Stock  

Holders of common stock are entitled to one
vote for each share held. There are no restrictions that limit the Company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock,
subject to the requirements of the Delaware Revised Statutes. The Company has not declared any dividends since incorporation. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 326,417 shares of $0.001 par value common stock for services with
a value of $166,883. The Company also issued shares in connection with debt of 1,568,754 for an aggregate fair value of $402,158.
Additionally, the Company issued and sold 1,142,667 shares of its common stock to several investors for an aggregate purchase price
of $172,500. The total number of shares issued or issuable as of September 30, 2016 was 18,044,588.

Note 11   Income (Loss) Per Share  

Net income (loss) per share is provided in
accordance with FASB ASC 260-10,   Earnings per Share .  Basic net income (loss) per common share ( EPS )
is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average shares outstanding,
assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued, unless doing so is anti-dilutive. 

The following shares are not included in the
computation of diluted income (loss) per share, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive: 

If all dilutive securities had been exercised
at September 30, 2016 the total number of common shares outstanding would be as follows:

Legal Proceedings   

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
from time to time is involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation process is inherently uncertain and
it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon the Company s financial condition
and/or results of operations. However, in the opinion of management, other than as set forth herein, matters currently pending
or threatened against the Company are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position
or results of operations. 

Note 16   Subsequent Events

Overview

We
are a previous development stage company that was incorporated in the State of Delaware in July 2013. In the year ending December
31, 2015, we generated our first revenues of $30,569 as well as deferred revenues of $81,674. From July 2, 2013 (inception) to
December 31, 2015, we experienced a net loss and accumulated deficit of $731,111 and total liabilities of $366,568 including $140,407
in notes payable to our president, Laurence Wainer. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had revenues of
$143,758 and $278,413, repespectively, and a net loss of $173,571 and $515,928, respectively.  

We
are in the business of renting a breath alcohol ignition interlock device called the BDI-747/1, which is a mechanism that is installed
on the steering column of an automobile and into which a driver exhales. The device in turn provides a blood-alcohol concentration
analysis. If the driver s blood-alcohol content is higher than a certain pre-programmed limit, the device prevents the ignition
from engaging and the automobile from starting. We also have the option of in-car camera technology, which some states require
for state approval. The in-car camera feature is just one of several anti-circumvention features found on the BDI-747. These devices
are often required for use by DUI or DWI ( driving under the influence  or  driving while intoxicated )
offenders as part of a mandatory court or motor vehicle department program.   

On
June 17, 2015, our BDI-747 Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device, together with our patent pending BDI Model #1 power line
filter, were certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) as meeting or exceeding the 2013 NHSTA guidelines.
As a result, on July 27, 2015 we began production of our BDI-747 Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device with the attached BDI
Model #1 power line filter.   

Since
receiving our NHSTA Certification and as of August 15, 2016 we have submitted applications to 14 states to be considered as a
state-certified breath alcohol ignition interlock manufacturer and provider for all Ignition Interlock Mandated DUI/DWI offenders
throughout each state. As of November 15, 2016, 11 of these applications have been approved, specifically California, Colorado,
Oregon, Texas, Arizona, Kentucky, Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York, Tennessee, and are functionally operating in California, Oregon,
Arizona, Texas, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.   

In
some states we market, rent, install and support the devices directly and in other states we sell distributorships to authorized
distributors allowing them to lease, install, service, remove and support the BDI-747/1 devices. As of November 15, 2016, we lease
the devices directly in six states   California, Kentucky, Oregon, Pennsylvania, New York and Tennessee - and license the
device to distributors in three different areas   two counties in Texas and in the state of Arizona. In several of the states
where we lease directly we may eventually work with distributors in those states as well and lease both directly and through distributors.  

In
states where we rent the devices directly to consumers, we currently typically charge $198 in upfront fees for the user (which
covers two months of the lease payment), and then $99/month for the other ten months of the lease for the typical one year lease.
The lease payment covers the installation of the device in the consumer s vehicle, the rental of the device, recalibration
of the device as required by each state (typically every 30 to 60 days) and the monitoring services for the device, which are
then reported to the state in accordance with each state s requirements. In states and areas where we do not have a direct
presence, which we only have in Los Angeles, California, we contract with independent service centers, such as car alarm installation
companies or other auto services companies, to perform the installations of our BDI-747/1 device, which centers must be approved
by the states in which the perform the installations. Because our devices are installed in consumers  vehicles are part
of a judicially-mandated program, and since the use of the device controls the individual s driving privileges, collection
rates of the monthly leasing fees is close to 100%. The failure to make the payment could be a violation of the consumer s
sentence or probation and could cause them to lose the device and their driving privileges.  

In
areas where we have a distributor, in our typical distributorship arrangement, we charge the distributor a flat fee distributorship
territory fee up front (which fee varies based on the size and location of the distributorship), a $150 per unit registration
fee, and then a $35 monthly fee for each device the distributor has in its inventory. These fees may vary on a case-by-case basis.
The relationship with our distributors may either be on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis depending upon the location of the
distributorship and the fees charged.  

As
of November 21, 2016, between the devices we rent directly and those devices leased through our distributors, we have approximately
1,100 units on the road. We plan to increase our marketing of the device, and more aggressively pursue sales and distributors
once we have funds to manufacture additional units.  

Results
of Operations for Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Summary
of Results of Operations   

Operating
Loss; Net Income (Loss)   

Our
net income/(loss) changed by $49,812, from ($123,759) to ($173,571), from the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to
September 30, 2016. Our operating loss decreased by $78,144, from ($110,199) to ($32,055) for the same periods. The change in
our net income/(loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior year period, is primarily a result
of a significant increase loss on extinguishment of debt, an increase in our interest expense, an increase in depreciation expense,
and an increase in our common stock issued for services, partially offset by our revenues for the period, as well as decreases
in our payroll and research and development expenses. These changes are detailed below.  

Revenue   

We
had our first revenue during the latter part of 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we had $143,758 in revenues,
with $65,533 coming from revenue from the monthly recurring payments we received from our customers that rent our BDI-747/1 breathalyzer
device for the ongoing monitoring services related to the devices, and $78,225 coming from revenues paid to us from our distributors,
compared to $2,134 and $0 from these revenue sources for the same period one year ago. We expect the revenue we receive from monitoring
our devices on the road will continue to increase as we have more units on the road.  

Cost
of Revenue   

Our
cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $8,899, compared to $801 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Our cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was completely related to
our monthly monitoring services we provide to our customers.  

Payroll   

Our
payroll decreased by $9,919, from $40,658 to $30,739, from the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to September 30,
2016. We expect our payroll in future quarterly periods will be approximately $30,000-$40,000 per quarter until we are able to
expand our operations.  

Professional
Fees   

Our
professional fees decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015. Our professional fees were $4,266 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $12,554 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. These fees are largely related to fees paid for legal, accounting and audit services. We expect these fees to continue
grow steadily as our business expands. In the event we undertake an unusual transaction, such as an acquisition or file a registration
statement, we would expect these fees to substantially increase during that period.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses remained the same for the periods presented, from $55,193 for the three months ended September 30,
2015 to $56,348 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. We expect our general and administrative expenses to be around
$50,000 to $75,000 per quarter for the foreseeable future.  

Research
and Development   

We
did not incur any research and development expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,155 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Our research and development expenses in 2015 were related to our design and development of the
BDI-747/1 device. Since the device is now developed we did not incur any such expenses in the three months ended September 30,
2016.  

Depreciation   

We
had depreciation of $16,041 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $972 for the same period one year ago.
Our depreciation and amortization expenses in 2016 were primarily related to the depreciation of the BDI-747/1 device.  

Common
Stock Issued for Services   

We
had common stock issued for services of $59,250 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0 for the same period
one year ago.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense increased by $35,214 from $6,575 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $41,789 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. For both periods these amounts are largely due to the interest we owe on outstanding debt including amortization of
debt discount costs. The interest expense significantly increased for the period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same
period one year ago, due to our increase in outstanding debt compared to one year ago.  

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liability   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a change in fair value of derivative liability of $16,814 compared to $0 for
the same period in 2015. The change in fair value of derivative liability in the three months ended September 30, 2016, relates
to the conversion feature of a promissory note we had outstanding during this period. Since the conversion price on the promissory
note is calculated based on a discount to the closing price of our common stock, as our closing price fluctuates it changes the
fair value of the derivative liability.  

Loss
on Extinguishment of Debt   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a loss on extinguishment of debt of $116,541 compared to $0 for the same period
in 2015. The loss on extinguishment of debt in the three months ended September 30, 2016, relates to the deemed extinguishment
of royalty note #1 as discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements.  

Results
of Operations for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Summary
of Results of Operations   

Operating
Loss; Net Income (Loss)   

Our
net income/(loss) changed by $138,339, from ($377,589) to ($515,928), from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to
September 30, 2016. Our operating loss decreased by $73,110, from ($357,985) to ($284,875) for the same periods. The change in
our net income/(loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior year period, is primarily a result of
a significant increase loss on extinguishment of debt, an increase in our general and administrative expenses, an increase in
our interest expense, an increase in depreciation expense, and an increase in our common stock issued for services, partially
offset by our increase in revenues for the period, as well as decreases in our payroll and research and development expenses.
These changes are detailed below.  

Revenue   

We
had our first revenue during the latter part of 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had $278,413 in revenues,
with $200,188 coming from revenue from the monthly recurring payments we received from our customers that rent our BDI-747/1 breathalyzer
device for the ongoing monitoring services related to the devices, and $78,225 coming from revenues paid to us from our distributors,
compared to $2,134 and $0 from these revenue sources for the same period one year ago. We expect the revenue we receive from monitoring
our devices on the road will continue to increase as we have more units on the road.  

Cost
of Revenue   

Our
cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $26,617, compared to $801 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Our cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, was completely related to our
monthly monitoring services we provide to our customers.  

Payroll   

Our
payroll decreased by $37,166, from $133,152 to $95,986, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to September 30,
2016. We expect our payroll in future quarterly periods will be approximately $30,000-$40,000 per quarter until we are able to
expand our operations.  

Professional
Fees   

Our
professional fees increased slightly during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Our professional fees were $65,887 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $59,554 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. These fees are largely related to fees paid for legal, accounting and audit services. We expect these fees
to continue grow steadily as our business expands. In the event we undertake an unusual transaction, such as an acquisition or
file a registration statement, we would expect these fees to substantially increase during that period.  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses increased by $143,135, from $105,172 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $248,307 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We expect our general and administrative expenses to be around $50,000 to $75,000 per
quarter for the foreseeable future.  

Research
and Development   

We
did not incur any research and development expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $59,785 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Our research and development expenses in 2015 were related to our design and development of the
BDI-747/1 device. Since the device is now developed we did not incur any such expenses in the nine months ended September 30,
2016.  

Depreciation   

We
had depreciation of $32,971 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1,655 for the same period one year ago.
Our depreciation and amortization expenses in 2016 were primarily related to the depreciation of the BDI-747/1 device.  

Common
Stock Issued for Services   

We
had common stock issued for services of $166,833 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0 for the same period
one year ago.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense increased by $99,095 from $12,619 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $111,714 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. For both periods these amounts are largely due to the interest we owe on outstanding debt including amortization of
debt discount costs. The interest expense significantly increased for the period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same
period one year ago, due to our increase in outstanding debt compared to one year ago.  

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative Liability   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a change in fair value of derivative liability of $2,798 compared to $0 for the
same period in 2015. The change in fair value of derivative liability in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, relates to
the conversion feature of a promissory note we had outstanding during this period. Since the conversion price on the promissory
note is calculated based on a discount to the closing price of our common stock, as our closing price fluctuates it changes the
fair value of the derivative liability.  

Loss
on Extinguishment of Debt   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a loss on extinguishment of debt of $116,541 compared to $0 for the same period
in 2015. The loss on extinguishment of debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, relates to the deemed extinguishment
of royalty note #1 as discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Introduction    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, because of our operating losses, we did not generate positive operating cash
flows. Our cash on hand as of September 30, 2016 was $194,871 and our cash used in operations is approximately $50,000 per month.
As a result, we have short term cash needs. These needs are being satisfied through proceeds from the sales of our securities
and loans from both related parties and third parties. We currently do not believe we will be able to satisfy our cash needs from
our revenues for some time.  

Our
cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and as of December 31,
2015, respectively, are as follows:  

Our
current assets increased significantly as of September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015, due to us having more cash on
hand and higher accounts receivable, net as of September 30, 2016. The increase in our total assets between the two periods was
also related to the increase in our cash on hand, accounts receivable, net, as well as an increase in furniture and equipment
as of September 30, 2016.  

Our
current liabilities decreased by $3,350, as of September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily
due to decreases in our accrued expenses, deferred revenue, and notes payable   related party, current portion, offset by
slight increases in our accounts payable, accrued interest, income taxes payable, derivative liability, and notes payable  
current portion.  

In
order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise significant capital from other sources.
There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts.  

Sources
and Uses of Cash   

Operations   

We
had net cash used in operating activities of $182,150 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $301,188 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the period in 2016, the net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily
of our net income (loss) of ($515,928), adjusted primarily by change in fair value of derivative liability of $2,798, shares issued
for services of $166,883, amortization of debt discount of $89,109, depreciation of $32,971, and loss on extinguishment of debt
of $116,541 as well as changes in, accrued expenses of ($8,397), deferred revenue of ($18,121), deposits of ($12,000), accounts
payable of $10,767, and accounts receivable of ($47,898). For the period in 2015, the net cash used in operating activities consisted
primarily of our net income (loss) of ($377,589), adjusted primarily by change in fair value of derivative liability of $6,985,
and depreciation of $1,655, as well as changes in, accrued expenses of $23,656, deferred revenue of $92,885, deposits of ($6,225),
accrued interest of ($9,412), and accounts receivable of ($32,500).  

Investments   

We
had cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $176,433, compared to $63,649 for September
30, 2015. For both periods the cash used in investing activities related to purchases of furniture and equipment.  

Financing   

Our
net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $544,351, compared to $105,497 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net cash from financing activities
consisted of proceeds from notes payable of $471,199 and proceeds from issuance of common stock of $172,500, partially offset
by repayments of notes payable of ($99,348). For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our net cash from financing activities
consisted of proceeds from notes payable of $15,000 and proceeds from issuance of common stock of $101,235, partially offset by
repayments of notes payable of ($10,738).  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Commitments
and Contingent Liabilities   

Liabilities
for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection
with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. As of September 30, 2016, we have no contingent liability that is required to
be recorded nor disclosed.  

On
January 21, 2015, we and Mr. Wainer entered into a two-year lease with Marsel Plaza LLC for a storefront location at 1080 South
La Cienega Boulevard, Suite 304, Los Angeles, California 90035. Our base rent under the lease is $1,450 per month. The lease began
on February 1, 2015.

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.  

ITEM
4 Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Pursuant
to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This
evaluation was done as of the end of September 30, 2016 under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive
officer and our principal financial officer.  

Based
upon our evaluation, our principal executive and financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our existing disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective. Disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. With only two officers in charge of such reporting controls, there is
no backup to the oversight of such individual and thus such disclosure controls and procedures may not be considered effective.  

We
have engaged outside accounting and finance advisors to assist us in better implementing effective disclosure controls and procedures.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

On
November 15, 2016, we hired Mr. Abraham Summers as our Chief Executive Officer, which will help segregate the duties of our executive
offices between two individuals rather than just one, which we believe will improve our internal controls over financial reporting.
Except hiring Mr. Summers, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection
with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our first quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting   

We
are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Rule 13a-15
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our president conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, based on the criteria establish in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of September 30, 2016, based on those criteria. A control system
can provide only reasonably, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected.  

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 and identified the following
material weaknesses, which are outlined further in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015:  

Inadequate
segregation of duties:  We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures.  

We
have not documented our internal controls:  We have limited policies and procedures that cover the recording and reporting
of financial transactions and accounting provisions. As a result we may be delayed in our ability to calculate certain accounting
provisions.  

We
do not have effective controls over the control environment.  A formally adopted written code of business conduct and ethics
that governs our employees, officers, and directors was not in place. Additionally, management has not developed and effectively
communicated to our employees its accounting policies and procedures. This has resulted in inconsistent practices. We also do
not have independent members on our Board of Directors.  

We
have not been able to timely and accurately record convertible debt transactions, deferred revenue, and derivative liabilities
in the financial statements.  As a result, we have needed additional time, beyond the filing deadlines, to file our periodic
reports.

ITEM
1 Legal Proceedings  

On
April 5, 2016, we were sued in the District Court of Sedgwick County, State of Kansas (Case No. 16CV0822) by Theenk, Inc., a company
we sold an independent distributorship. According to the Complaint, Theenk, Inc. alleges we failed to perform under the Exclusive
Distribution Agreement we entered into with them on September 4, 2015 by failing to obtain approval for our BDI-747 breathalyzer
interlock device from the State of Kansas within 60 days from the execution of the Agreement, and further, that we failed to compensate
Theenk, Inc. for certain engineering hours and manufacturing and testing costs related to a potential add-on component to the
BDI-747 device. The Complaint seeks damages of $64,726.06. We were served with the Complaint on or about April 19, 2016. We originally
received an extension of time to file our Answer from Theenk, Inc. On June 2, 2016, prior to the time an Answer was due by us,
we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Theenk, Inc., whereby we agreed to pay Theenk, Inc. $17,500 in full settlement of
the lawsuit, including a dismissal of the lawsuit. Theenk, Inc. deposited the funds around August 30, 2016. On October 11, 2016,
the Court entered a Dismissal With Prejudice dismissing this lawsuit with prejudice. As a result, this lawsuit has been resolved
and dismissed.  

In
the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation
process is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon
our financial condition and/or results of operations. However, in the opinion of our management, other than as set forth herein,
matters currently pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position
or results of operations.

2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we issued the following unregistered securities:  

On
September 30, 2016, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to Secured Promissory Note and Agreement (the  Edris Note Amendment )
with Edris Consulting, Inc., a California corporation ( Edris ), under which we agreed to issue Edris 425,000 shares
of our common stock. On October 6, 2016, we issued the shares to Edris, with a standard restrictive legend. The issuance of the
was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, due to the fact Edris is a sophisticated
investor and familiar with our operations having entered into the Edris Original Note in January 2016.  

On
September 30, 2016, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to Secured Promissory Note and Agreement (the  Wainer Note Amendment )
with Chaim Wainer ( Wainer ), pursuant to which we amended the terms of that certain Secured Promissory Note and Agreement
dated March, 2016. Pursuant to the Wainer Note Amendment, we agreed to issue Wainer 50,000 shares of our common stock. On October
6, 2016, we issued the shares to Wainer, with a standard restrictive legend. The issuance of the was exempt from registration
pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, due to the fact Wainer is a sophisticated investor and familiar with
our operations having entered into the Wainer Original Note in March 2016. Wainer is the father of our sole officer and director.  

On
September 30, 2016, we entered into an Loan and Security Agreement (the  LSA ) with Doheny Group, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ( Doheny ), under which Doheny agreed to loan us up to $542,400 in two phases, to be used
by us to acquire additional parts and supplies to allow us to manufacture our proprietary breath alcohol ignition interlock devices.
Pursuant to the LSA with Doheny, we agreed to issue Doheny shares of our common stock that equals 4.99% of our then outstanding
common stock on the date of issuance after Doheny funded the Phase 1 Loan. The Phase 1 Loan was funded in the amount of $192,000
by Doheny on September 30, 2016. On October 7, 2016, we issued Doheny 845,913 shares of our common stock, with a standard restrictive
legend. The issuance of the was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, due to the
fact Doheny is an accredited investor and familiar with our operations according the representations and warranties in the LSA
and accompanying stock purchase agreement.  

No
underwriters were involved in any of the issuances provided in this Item 2. The shares were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Act ) because the individuals either represented that they were  accredited
investors  as such term is defined in the rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Act, were our employees
and/or were known to our management and in possession of the information that registration of the securities would provide them.
The sale of the securities did not involve any form of general solicitation or general advertising.

Doheny
Group Transaction    

On
September 30, 2016, we entered into an Loan and Security Agreement (the  LSA ) with Doheny Group, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ( Doheny ), under which Doheny agreed to loan us up to $542,400 in two phases, to be used
by us to acquire additional parts and supplies to allow us to manufacture our proprietary breath alcohol ignition interlock devices
(the  Devices ). Under the terms of the LSA, the first phase will be a loan of up to $192,000 (the  Phase 1
Loan ), when we request it in accordance with the LSA, in order to for us to acquire parts and supplies to manufacture 600
Devices; and the second phase will be a loan of up to $350,400 (the  Phase 2 Loan ), when we request it in accordance
with the LSA and assuming we are in compliance with the other terms of the LSA, in order for us to acquire parts and supplies
to manufacture 1000 Devices.  

The
Phase 1 Loan was funded in the amount of $192,000 by Doheny on September 30, 2016, and we forwarded the funds to our supplier
on or about October 5, 2016, in order to acquire parts and supplies to manufacture 600 Devices. Both the Phase 1 Loan and the
Phase 2 Loan mature three (3) years from the date of funding, and are at an interest rate of 25% per annum. We can prepay the
Phase 1 Loan and the Phase 2 Loan (if applicable) at any time without penalty. In exchange for Doheny funding the Phase 1 Loan,
we issued Doheny a promissory note. As additional consideration for Doheny agreeing to enter into the LSA and fund the Phase 1
Loan, we agreed to issue Doheny shares of our common stock equal to 4.99% of our then-outstanding common stock, pursuant to the
terms of a stock purchase agreement. As a result, on or about October 7, 2016, we issued Doheny 845,913 shares of our common stock.
If Doheny funds the Phase 2 Loan then we are obligated to issue Doheny that number of additional shares of our common stock that
equals 5% of our then-outstanding common stock. Until we repay the Phase 1 Loan and the Phase 2 Loan, as applicable, Doheny has
anti-dilution rights for the percentage of our stock Doheny owns in the event we issue additional shares of common stock during
that period. We also entered into a Royalty Agreement with Doheny, under which we granted Doheny perpetual royalty rights on all
Devices that we receive money from customers or distributors after we have 500 Devices leased to end users or distributors. The
royalty amounts vary between $1 and $2 per Device depending on a variety of factors.  

Amendment
to Loan Agreement with Edris Consulting    

On
September 30, 2016, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to Secured Promissory Note and Agreement (the  Edris Note Amendment )
with Edris Consulting, Inc., a California corporation ( Edris ), pursuant to which we amended the terms of that certain
Secured Promissory Note and Agreement dated January 20, 2016 (the  Edris Original Note ) in order to remove Edris 
security interest in our assets to secure our repayment of the Edris Original Note and amend the royalty provisions of the Edris
Original Note to be $1 for each Device we have on the road beginning in the 25 th  month after the date of the Edris
Original Note. In exchange for Edris agreeing to forfeit its security interest in our assets and modify the royalty payments under
the Edris Original Note we agreed to issue Edris 425,000 shares of our common stock, restricted in accordance with Rule 144.  

Amendment
to Loan Agreement with Chaim Wainer    

On
September 30, 2016, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to Secured Promissory Note and Agreement (the  Wainer Note Amendment )
with Chaim Wainer ( Wainer ), pursuant to which we amended the terms of that certain Secured Promissory Note and Agreement
dated March, 2016 (the  Wainer Original Note ) in order to amend the royalty provisions of the Wainer Original Note
to be $1 for each Device we have on the road beginning in the 25 th  month after the date of the Wainer Original Note.
In exchange for Wainer agreeing to modify the royalty payments under the Wainer Original Note we agreed to issue Wainer 50,000
shares of our common stock, restricted in accordance with Rule 144. Wainer is the father of our sole officer and director.  

Amendment
to Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Jay Lopez    

On
September 30, 2016, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to Exclusive Distribution Agreement (the  Lopez Amendment )
with Jay Lopez ( Lopez ), pursuant to which we amended the terms of that certain Exclusive Distribution Agreement
dated July 24, 2015 in order to amend the territories where Lopez is an exclusive distributor of ours for the BDI-747/1 device,
removing the State of Nevada and granting Lopez rights in the State of Pennsylvania. With the execution of the Lopez Amendment,
we do not have a distributor in the State of Nevada and Lopez is our exclusive distributor in Pennsylvania.  

Hiring
of Abraham Summers as our Chief Financial Officer    

On
November 15, 2016, we hired Mr. Abraham Summers as our Chief Financial Officer. Under our Employment Agreement with Mr. Summers,
we agreed to compensate Mr. Summers at a salary equal to 40% of the compensation we are paying Mr. Laurence Wainer, our Chief
Executive Officer, at any given time. In addition, we agreed to retain Gnossis International, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr.
Summers, to consult with us regarding economics, project management   business development. We agreed to compensate Gnossis
International at the same rate of 40% of the compensation we are paying Mr. Wainer. We also have a pre-existing finder s
agreement with Gnossis International, under which we agreed to compensate Gnossis International one share of our common stock
for every dollar of financing we receive from any individuals or entities introduced to us by Gnossis.  

Mr.
Abraham Summers  was hired as our Chief Financial Officer in November 2016. Since 2011, Mr. Summers has been the managing member

upon the rate or rates of interest and manner of payment stated within it;  provided, however , that, anything contained herein
to the contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or rates of interest or manner of payment exceeds the maximum allowable under Applicable
Laws, then, ipso facto, as of the date of this Agreement, Borrower is and shall be liable only for the payment of such maximum

   CONSIDERATION: EQUITY GRANT AND ROYALTIES.  

3.1  Equity Grant
In BDIC  . 

(a) In consideration of Lender
agreeing to extend credit to Borrower in connection with the Phase 1 Loan and the Phase 2 Loan, respectively, and in lieu of other
fees and charges associated with the Loan, BDIC shall issue to Lender, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and
without further consideration, the requisite amount of fully paid, non-assessable shares (the   Shares  ) of common
stock of Borrower (  Common Stock  ) as follows: 

(i) Upon Lender's delivery
of funds as provided herein associated with one or more Advances of the Phase 1 Loan in the full amount of the Phase 1 Maximum
Amount, BDIC shall issue to Lender Shares of Common Stock (the   Initial Share Issuance  ) in an amount equal to
4.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of such issuance date (the   Initial Anti-Dilution Threshold  
and 

(ii) Upon Lender's delivery
of funds as provided herein associated with one or more Advance of the Phase 2 Loan in the full amount of the Phase 2 Maximum Amount,
BDIC shall issue to Lender additional Shares of Common Stock (the   Subsequent Share Issuance  ) in an amount such
that, after consideration of the Initial Share Issuance, the Shares owned by Lender following the Subsequent Share Issuance represents
9.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of such issuance date (the   Anti-Dilution Threshold  
provided, however, that if Lender sells to any unrelated Person any shares of Common Stock granted in connection with the Initial
Share Issuance prior to the Subsequent Share Issuance, then the Anti-Dilution Threshold hereunder will be adjusted such that it
will be the sum of (x) the Initial Anti-Dilution Threshold, as reduced pursuant to  Section 3.1(e)  below, plus (y) with respect
to the Subsequent Share Issuance, 5.00% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of such issuance date, subject
to subsequent adjustment following the Subsequent Share Issuance pursuant to  Section 3.1(e)  below. 

(iii) For the avoidance
of doubt, the Shares, including, without limitation, Shares from each of the Initial Share Issuance and the Subsequent Share Issuance,
shall be subject to anti-dilution protection as provided in this Section 3.1, with the Lender's maximum ownership of Shares of
Common Stock being 9.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment as set forth in  Section
3.1(e)  below. 

(b) In connection with each
said issuance, (1) BDIC shall deliver to Lender the documentation attached hereto required to be executed and delivered between
the parties hereto to effectuate the issuance of the Shares (including, without limitation, the Initial Share Issuance and the
Subsequent Share Issuance, as appropriate) , a copy of the form of which is attached hereto as   Exhibit D   (the   Issuance
Documents  ), and BDIC and Lender shall execute and deliver all of said documentation as required to effectuate the issuance
of the Shares as contemplated herein in compliance with Applicable Laws, (2) BDIC shall file such documents, instruments, certificates
and agreements, and take such action as reasonable and appropriate, to comply with any and all Applicable Laws, and in connection
therewith, provide such assistance as reasonable and appropriate to Lender concerning Lender's compliance with Applicable Laws
relating to the issuance of the Shares, and (3) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, Borrower and BDIC shall agree
to allocate in good faith a  cost  basis in said Shares of Common Stock in an amount equal to the fair market of BDIC's
Common Stock on or about the end of July, 2016, which represents the time at which the parties entered into negotiations and tentatively
agreed that if Lender loaned Borrower funds sufficient to acquire the necessary base units and other parts from Supplier to manufacture
at least 1500 Devices then BDIC, among other things, would issue to Lender shares of Common Stock. 

(c) Commencing as of the
Effective Date and continuing until the later of (x) the expiration of the Term or (y) three (3) years from the date of any issuance
of Shares as contemplated herein (the   Anti-Dilution Period  ), BDIC will provide Lender with anti-dilution protection
to permit Lender, at no additional cost or expense, to maintain the Initial Anti-Dilution Threshold and/or the Anti-Dilution Threshold,
as applicable, as of such date in the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. By way of illustration and not of limitation,
upon such time during the Anti-Dilution Period as (i) BDIC grants, issues or conveys in any manner any shares of Common Stock in
BDIC, including, without limitation, the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock and/or (ii) any Person converts any convertible
preferred stock (if any) in BDIC into Common Stock and/or any Person exercises any option, warrant or convertible debt or equity
instrument, the result of which is such Person is entitled to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, then BDIC will immediately
and simultaneously issue to Lender, without cost or expense, additional Shares of Common Stock so that, immediately after such
event, Lender maintains its Initial Anti-Dilution Threshold interest or its Anti-Dilution Threshold interest, as the case may be,
in the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. 

(d) Anything to the contrary
contained herein notwithstanding, if the issuances of the Shares as contemplated herein result in Lender having the right to own
 fractional shares  of Common Stock, to the extent that such fractional shares, if  rounded up  to the next
whole share of Common Stock, would result in Lender owning Shares in excess of the Anti-Dilution Threshold, then such fractional
shares shall be rounded down such that Lender's ownership of shares of Common Stock is not in excess of the Anti-Dilution Threshold. 

(e) Furthermore, to the extent
that Lender sells to any unrelated Person any shares of Common Stock during the Anti-Dilution Period, then, upon the closing of
such sale, the Initial Anti-Dilution Threshold interest or the Anti-Dilution Threshold interest, as applicable, shall be adjusted
to reflect, immediately after said closing, the (1) number of Shares of Common Stock held by Lender as of such date (as may be
increased for any additional issuances as contemplated in Section 3.1(c) above), divided by (2) the number of issued and outstanding
shares of Common stock in BDIC. By way of illustration and not of limitation, to the extent that Lender owns 9,999 Shares of Common
Stock, representing ownership of 9.99% of all shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding (i.e., BDIC has 100,000 shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding as of said date), and during the Anti-Dilution Period Lender sells to an unrelated person 1,999 shares
of Common Stock, then, for purposes of this Section 3.1, the Anti-Dilution Threshold has decreased from 9.99% to 8.00% (representing
8000 Shares of Common Stock compared to 100,000 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding). 

3.2  Royalties  . 

(a) In consideration of Lender
agreeing to extend credit to Borrower in connection with the Loan, and in lieu of other fees and charges associated with the Loan,
concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and without further consideration, Borrower shall promptly enter into
and deliver to Lender that certain Royalty Agreement in favor of Lender, a copy of which is attached hereto as   Exhibit E  
(the   Royalty Agreement  ), the terms and conditions of which are incorporated herein and made a part hereof. 

(b) As more fully set forth
in the Royalty Agreement, Borrower agrees to grant Lender the following per calendar month cum ulative
royalties in perpetuity on Total Units:  

(c)
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Royalty Agreement, the royalty payment obligation shall commence from and after the
occurr ence of the number of Total Units being in excess of 500 Devices (the   Royalty Commencement Date  ).
Once this occurs, then beginning on the first calendar month thereafter, and for every subsequent calendar month thereafter in
perpetuity, Borrower will pay the applicable royalty payments per calendar month for each of the Total Units in accordance with
the above schedule based on each Total Unit for which Borrower received cash or other consideration from or on behalf of the Client
thereof (or for which Borrower voluntarily elected to waive any right to payment or other consideration from the Client thereof).
Such payments will be payable to Lender on the 15 th  of each calendar month following the Royalty Commencement Date
in perpetuity, even after all Obligations due under the Loan Documents (other than the Royalty Agreement) have been indefeasibly
paid in full (and not subject to disgorgement or recovery). 

(d) In connection with each
royalty payment, Borrower shall provide a statement setting forth the calculation of the royalty amount, along with such supporting
documentation as reasonable and appropriate or as may be reasonably requested from time to time by Lender. The parties expressly
acknowledge and agree that (1) to the extent that Borrower elects to forgo, defer or waive any such payment due from a Client with
respect to a Device, or receive other consideration concerning said Device, such amount shall nonetheless be included in the determination
of royalties due thereunder, and (2) each will meet on no less than an annual basis to work in good faith to  true up 
the amount of royalties due under the Royalty Agreement, and in connection therewith, to the extent that an adjustment is needed
(either because too little or too much was paid in royalties in a given year (or other period), either Borrower will promptly advance
additional liquid funds to Lender, or Borrower will offset present or future royalties due Lender under the Royalty Agreement,
as the case may be. 

(e) By way of illustration
and not of limitation, Borrower will only pay royalties to Lender for each of the Total Units from and after the Royalty Commencement
Date that it receives payment or other consideration from the Client of said Total Unit (or for which Borrower voluntarily elected
to waive any right to payment or other consideration from the Client thereof). Solely for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes
of determining the proper amount of royalties under the Royalty Agreement, (1) in the event that Borrower receives an advance payment
from a Client (for example, $1,200 for twelve monthly payments due from a Retail Unit Client of $100 per month, when there are
only 550 Total Units), then in such a situation, the amount of royalties due with respect to said Total Unit shall be $12, all
of which is payable on the 15 th  day of the calendar month immediately following receipt of said $1,200, (2) in the event
that Borrower does not receive payment from a client until after the Device has been provided to said Client (for example, a Device
representing a Retail Unit is given to a Client on January 1 for a 12 month period, the rental amount is $100/month, and payment
is not received by Borrower until December 20 th  of said year, when there are only 550 Total Units), then in such a situation,
the amount of royalties due with respect to said Total Unit shall be $12, all of which is payable on January 15 of the following
year, and (3) assuming the same facts as set forth in subsection 3.2(d)(1) above, except that the Client returns the Device within
6 months and is permitted to recover the remaining 6 months of payments (representing a refund of $600 from Borrower to said Client),
then in such a situation, Lender and Borrower will  true up  the amount of royalties due, and in this situation, Borrower
will offset present or future royalties due Lender by the amount of $6, representing the 6 months advanced by said Client which
was refunded from amounts received by Borrower at the commencement of the lease of said Total Unit. 

(f) Pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Royalty Agreement, Borrower shall provide Lender with, among other things, (i) financial statements and reports
consistent with Section 7.1 below, and (ii) audit and inspection rights consistent with Section 7.2 below, to permit Lender to
ascertain Borrower's compliance with the terms and conditions of the Royalty Agreement, which obligations shall survive the expiration
of the Term and the indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations hereunder. 

(g) Pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Royalty Agreement, in the event that Borrower enters into any transaction (regardless of form) or upon the
occurrence whereby (x) Borrower sells, conveys, transfers or assigns (in any manner, including, without limitation, pursuant to
a license, lease, assignment for the benefit of creditors, merger or other consolidation) all or substantially all of the Devices
and/or its assets, or (y) all or substantially all of the equity of Borrower is sold, conveyed, transferred, or assigned, or (z)
Borrower transfers, sells, assigns or conveys in any manner the Business and/or control of Borrower and/or the Business, then,
as an express condition of said transaction or occurrence, Borrower expressly acknowledges and agrees that it shall cause the acquirer/surviving
Person (the   Acquirer  ) to include in any acquisition/merger/transfer document a requirement that the royalty
obligations of Borrower under the Royalty Agreement are expressly assumed by such Acquirer, who shall be liable with respect to
the royalties due under the Royalty Agreement as if an original party thereto. Without limiting any of its rights or remedies whatsoever,
to the extent that the Acquirer is not bound by and/or does not honor the terms and conditions of the Royalty Agreement, then,
Borrower shall pay to Lender as a  liquidated damage  resulting therefrom in one lump sum an amount equal to the product
of the last 12 calendar months of royalty payments pursuant to the Royalty Agreement, multiplied by 100.

any and all balances and deposits of Borrower held by Lender, and any amounts received by or on behalf of Lender, to secure the
full and final repayment of all of the Obligations;

store, finish, maintain, repair, prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell (in the manner provided for herein) the Collateral.

trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and advertising matter, or any property of a similar nature, as it pertains
to the Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale, and selling any Borrower Collateral and Borrower s
rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to Lender s benefit; 

(j) Sell the Collateral at
either a public or private sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or transactions, for cash or on terms, in such manner

the Collateral be present at any such sale.

by Lender of one right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and no waiver by Lender of any Event of Default shall be deemed a
continuing waiver. No delay by Lender shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it.

ROYALTIES and Payments   .  

2.1
 Royalties  . In consideration of TDG agreeing to extend credit to BDI Group in connection with the Loan, and in lieu
of other fees and charges associated with the Loan, BDI Group hereby grants to TDG as of the Effective Date and in perpetuity
and without further consideration the right to payment of royalties (a   Royalty   or   Royalties  )
as set forth herein. The Royalty obligation due in favor of TDG hereunder shall vest fully and immediately upon the Effective
Date.  

2.2
 Determination of Royalty Amounts  . The amount of Royalties due to TDG shall be determined as follows per calendar month
on a cumulative basis in perpetuity:  

2.3
 Payment of Royalties  .  

(a)
The Royalty obligation due hereunder shall commence from and after the occurrence of the number of Total Units being in excess
of 500 Devices (the   Royalty Commencement Date  ). Once this occurs, then beginning on the first calendar month
thereafter, and for every subsequent calendar month thereafter in perpetuity, BDI Group will pay the applicable Royalty payments
per calendar month for each of the Total Units in accordance with the above schedule based on each Total Unit for which BDI Group
received cash or other consideration from or on behalf of the Client thereof (or for which BDI Group voluntarily elected to waive
any right to payment or other consideration from the Client thereof). Such payments will be payable to TDG on the 15 th 
of each calendar month following the Royalty Commencement Date in perpetuity, even after all Obligations due under the Loan Documents
(other than the Royalty Agreement) have been indefeasibly paid in full (and not subject to disgorgement or recovery).  

(b)
In connection with each Royalty payment, BDI Group shall provide a statement setting forth the calculation of the Royalty amount,
along with such supporting documentation as reasonable and appropriate or as may be reasonably requested from time to time by
TDG. The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that (1) to the extent that BDI Group elects to forgo, defer or waive any such
payment due from a Client with respect to a Device, or receive other consideration concerning said Device, such amount shall nonetheless
be included in the determination of Royalties due thereunder, and (2) the parties hereto will meet on no less than an annual basis
to work in good faith to  true up  the amount of royalties due under this Agreement, and in connection therewith,
to the extent that an adjustment is needed (either because too little or too much was paid in Royalties in a given year (or other
period), either BDI Group will promptly advance additional liquid funds to TDG, or BDI Group will offset present or future Royalties
due TDG under this Agreement, as the case may be.  

(c)
By way of illustration and not of limitation, BDI Group will only pay Royalties to TDG for each of the Total Units from and after
the Royalty Commencement Date that it receives payment or other consideration from the Client of said Total Unit (or for which
BDI Group voluntarily elected to waive any right to payment or other consideration from the Client thereof). Solely for the avoidance
of doubt, for purposes of determining the proper amount of Royalties hereunder, (1) in the event that BDI Group receives an advance
payment from a Client (for example, $1,200 for twelve monthly payments due from a Retail Unit Client of $100 per month, when there
are only 550 Total Units), then in such a situation, the amount of Royalties due with respect to said Total Unit shall be $12,
all of which is payable on the 15 th  day of the calendar month immediately following receipt of said $1,200, (2) in
the event that BDI Group does not receive payment from a client until after the Device has been provided to said Client (for example,
a Device representing a Retail Unit is given to a Client on January 1 for a 12 month period, the rental amount is $100/month,
and payment is not received by BDI Group until December 20 th  of said year, when there are only 550 Total Units), then
in such a situation, the amount of Royalties due with respect to said Total Unit shall be $12, all of which is payable on January
15 of the following year, and (3) assuming the same facts as set forth in  subsection 2.3(c)(1)  above, except that the Client
returns the Device within 6 months and is permitted to recover the remaining 6 months of payments (representing a refund of $600
from BDI Group to said Client), then in such a situation, TDG and BDI Group will  true up  the amount of Royalties
due, and in this situation, BDI Group will offset present or future Royalties due TDG by the amount of $6, representing the 6
months advanced by said Client which was refunded from amounts received by BDI Group at the commencement of the lease of said
Total Unit.  

(d)
All payments by BDI Group hereunder shall be made in the lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available
funds on the date specified herein and shall be delivered to TDG or its designee as follows:  

(i)
If via wire transfer, pursuant to wire instructions provided from time to time by TDG for deposit into an account designated from
time to time by TDG for TDG s benefit;  

(ii)
If via check, to the following address:  THE DOHENY GROUP, LLC,  ________________________, Los Angeles, CA 9____, Attention:
David Haridim, Managing Member, or to such other address or to the attention of such other person as specified by prior written
notice to BDIC.  

(e)
Time is of the essence in all obligations of BDI Group hereunder, including, without limitation, payment of the Royalties as expressly
provided herein.  

2.4
 Liquidation Event  . Upon the occurrence of a Transfer Event, then, as an express condition of said Transfer Event, BDI
Group expressly acknowledges and agrees that it shall cause the acquirer/surviving Person (the   Acquirer  )
to include in any acquisition/merger/transfer document a requirement that the obligations hereunder of BDI Group with respect
to the Royalty pursuant to this Agreement be expressly assumed by such Acquirer, who shall be directly liable with respect to
the Royalties due hereunder as if an original party hereto. Without limiting any of its rights or remedies whatsoever, to the
extent that the Acquirer is not bound by and/or does not honor the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, failing to perform its obligation to pay the Royalties as provided herein, upon written notice to BDI Group, BDI Group
shall pay to TDG as a  liquidated damage  resulting therefrom in one lump sum an amount equal to the product of the
then (as of the date of the Transfer Event) last 12 calendar months of payments of Royalties hereunder multiplied by 100.  

3.

COMMON
STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT   

This
Common Stock Purchase Agreement (this  Agreement ) is made and entered into effective as of the 30th day of September,
2016 (the  Effective Date ) by and between Blow   Drive Interlock Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the  Company 
or  BDIC ), and The Doheny Group, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (the  Purchaser  or  TDG ).
The Company and Purchaser shall each be referred to as a  Party  and collectively as the  Parties.   

R
E C I T A L S   

WHEREAS,
 BDIC is a publicly-traded company quoted on the OTCQB-tier of OTC Markets in the business of manufacturing and leasing breath
alcohol ignition interlock devices (the   Business  ), including, without limitation, the BDI-747/1 breath/alcohol
ignition interlock device, along with its patent pending BDI Model #1 power line filter. As of December 31, 2015, the BDI-747/1
breath/alcohol ignition interlock device was  approved  by ten states, including, without limitation, California,
with applications for additional state approvals pending. In states where the Device is approved as a breath alcohol ignition
interlock device (  BAID  ), BDIC leases these devices to offenders depending upon the sentence received by such
offender. In some states, BDIC leases, installs and supports these devices directly; in other states, BDIC sells distributorships
to authorized distributors allowing the distributor to lease, install, service, remove and support said devices;  

WHEREAS ,
pursuant to that certain Loan and Security Agreement of even date herewith entered into between BDIC, as BDIC, and TDG, as TDG,
a copy of which is attached hereto as   Exhibit A   (the   Loan Agreement  ), TDG agreed to loan funds
and extend credit to BDIC to permit it to manufacture more Devices and expand the Business, subject to the terms and conditions
of the Loan Agreement; and  

WHEREAS ,
pursuant to the Loan Agreement, in consideration of TDG agreeing to extend credit to BDIC in connection with the Loan, BDIC agrees
to enter into this Agreement with TDG to set forth the terms under which BDIC is issuing shares of its common stock.  

NOW,
THEREFORE , in consideration of the mutual conditions and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for good and valuable
consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, BDIC and TDG hereby agree to enter into this Agreement as follows:  

AGREEMENT   

1.
 PURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK : Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Loan Agreement, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Loan Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to issue to the Purchaser Eight Hundred
Forty Five Thousand Nine Hundred Thirteen (845,913) shares of the Company s Common Stock (the  Shares ) in exchange
for the Purchaser loaning the Company funds under the Loan Agreement (the  Purchase Price ). To the extent permitted,
the Shares will be allocated a cost-basis equal to the highest trading price of the Common Stock over the 52-week period immediately
preceding the issuance date, or at the highest cost-basis permitted under the law.  

2.
 CLOSING AND DELIVERY :  

a)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares (the  Closing )
shall be held simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement, or at such other time mutually agreed upon between the constituent
Parties (the  Closing Date ). The Closing shall take place at the offices of counsel for the Company set forth in
Section 6 hereof, or by the exchange of documents and instruments by mail, courier, facsimile and wire transfer to the extent
mutually acceptable to the Parties hereto.  

b)
At the Closing:  

(i)
The Company and the Purchaser shall execute the Loan Agreement and this Agreement, which shall serve as evidence of ownership
of the Shares, free from restrictions on transfer except as set forth in this Agreement. Subsequent to the Closing, but as expeditiously
as possible, the Company will issue a stock certificate to the Purchaser to evidence the Shares.  

(ii)
The Purchaser shall deliver to the Company the Purchase Price by loaning the Company the funds set forth in the Loan Agreement.  

3.
 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS BY PURCHASER : The Purchaser hereby represents, warrants and agrees as follows:  

a)
 Purchase for Own Account . Purchaser represents that it is acquiring the Shares solely for its own account and beneficial
interest for investment and not for sale or with a view to distribution of the Shares or any part thereof, has no present intention
of selling (in connection with a distribution or otherwise), granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same,
and does not presently have reason to anticipate a change in such intention.  

b)
 Ability to Bear Economic Risk . Purchaser acknowledges that an investment in the Shares involves a high degree of risk,
and represents that it is able, without materially impairing its financial condition, to hold the Shares for an indefinite period
of time and to suffer a complete loss of his investment.  

c)
 Access to Information.  The Purchaser acknowledges that it s members and managers, as applicable, have been furnished
with such financial and other information concerning the Company, the directors and officers of the Company, and the business
and proposed business of the Company as the Purchaser considers necessary in connection with the Purchaser s investment
in the Shares. As a result, the Purchaser is thoroughly familiar with the proposed business, operations, properties and financial
condition of the Company and has discussed with officers of the Company any questions the Purchaser may have had with respect
thereto. The Purchaser understands:  

(i)
The risks involved in this investment, including the speculative nature of the investment;  

(ii)
The financial hazards involved in this investment, including the risk of losing the Purchaser s entire investment;  

(iii)
The lack of liquidity and restrictions on transfers of the Shares; and  

(iv)
The tax consequences of this investment.  

The
Purchaser has consulted with the Purchaser s own legal, accounting, tax, investment and other advisers with respect to the
tax treatment of an investment by the Purchaser in the Shares and the merits and risks of an investment in the Shares.  

d)
 Shares Part of Private Placement . The Purchaser has been advised that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the  Act ), or qualified under the securities law of any state, on the ground, among others,
that no distribution or public offering of the Shares is to be effected and the Shares will be issued by the Company in connection
with a transaction that does not involve any public offering within the meaning of section 4(a)(2) of the Act and/or Regulation
D as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Act, and under any applicable state blue sky authority. The
Purchaser understands that the Company is relying in part on the Purchaser s representations as set forth herein for purposes
of claiming such exemptions and that the basis for such exemptions may not be present if, notwithstanding the Purchaser s
representations, the Purchaser has in mind merely acquiring the Shares for resale on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of some predetermined
event. The Purchaser has no such intention.  

e)
 Further Limitations on Disposition . Purchaser further acknowledges that the Shares are restricted securities under Rule
144 of the Act, and, therefore, if the Company, in its sole discretion, chooses to issue any certificates reflecting the ownership
interest in the Shares, those certificates will contain a restrictive legend substantially similar to the following:  

THESE
SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE  ACT ). THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD,
OFFERED FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER THE
ACT OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.  

Without
in any way limiting the representations set forth above, Purchaser further agrees not to make any disposition of all or any portion
of the Shares unless and until:  

(i)
There is then in effect a Registration Statement under the Act covering such proposed disposition and such disposition is made
in accordance with such Registration Statement; or  

(ii)
Purchaser shall have obtained the consent of the Company and notified the Company of the proposed disposition and shall have furnished
the Company with a detailed statement of the circumstances surrounding the proposed disposition, and if reasonably requested by
the Company, Purchaser shall have furnished the Company with an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that
such disposition will not require registration under the Act or any applicable state securities laws.  

Notwithstanding
the provisions of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above, no such registration statement or opinion of counsel shall be necessary for
a transfer by such Purchaser to a partner (or retired partner) of Purchaser, or transfers by gift, will or intestate succession
to any spouse or lineal descendants or ancestors, if all transferees agree in writing to be subject to the terms hereof to the
same extent as if they were Purchasers hereunder as long as the consent of the Company is obtained.  

f)
 Accredited Investor Status.  The Purchaser is an accredited investor, and has truthfully completed the Accredited Investor
Questionnaire attached hereto as  Exhibit A .  

g)
 Purchaser Authorization.  The Purchaser, if not an individual, is empowered and duly authorized to enter into this Agreement
under any governing document, partnership agreement, trust instrument, pension plan, charter, certificate of incorporation, bylaw
provision or the like; this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Purchaser enforceable against the Purchaser
in accordance with its terms; and the person signing this Agreement on behalf of the Purchaser is empowered and duly authorized
to do so by the governing document or trust instrument, pension plan, charter, certificate of incorporation, bylaw provision,
board of directors or stockholder resolution, or the like.  

h)
 No Backup Withholding.  The Social Security Number or taxpayer identification shown in this Agreement is correct, and the
Purchaser is not subject to backup withholding because (i) the Purchaser has not been notified that he or she is subject to backup
withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest and dividends or (ii) the Internal Revenue Service has notified the
Purchaser that he or she is no longer subject to backup withholding.  

4.
 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS BY COMPANY : The Company hereby represents, warrants and agrees as follows:  

a)
 Authority of Company . The Company has all requisite authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to carry out and
perform its obligations under the terms of this Agreement.  

b)

obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, the relief of debtors and, with respect to rights to indemnity, subject to federal and state securities laws. The
issuance of the Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, will not violate any preemptive rights, rights of
first refusal, or any other rights granted by the Company, and will be issued in compliance with all applicable federal and state
securities laws, and will be free of any liens or encumbrances, other than any liens or encumbrances created by or imposed upon
the Purchaser through no action of the Company; provided, however, that the Shares may be subject to restrictions on transfer
under state and/or federal securities laws as set forth herein or as otherwise required by such laws at the time the transfer
is proposed.  

c)
 Governmental Consents . All consents, approvals, orders, or authorizations of, or registrations, qualifications, designations,
declarations, or filings with, any governmental authority required on the part of the Company in connection with the valid execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the offer, sale or issuance of the Shares, or the consummation of any other transaction contemplated
hereby shall have been obtained, except for notices required or permitted to be filed with certain state and federal securities
commissions, which notices will be filed on a timely basis.  

5.
 INDEMNIFICATION : The Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and defend the Company and its officers and directors and hold
them harmless from and against any and all liability, damage, cost or expense incurred on account of or arising out of:  

(a)
Any breach of or inaccuracy in the Purchaser s representations, warranties or agreements herein;  

(b)
Any disposition of any Shares contrary to any of the Purchaser s representations, warranties or agreements herein;
