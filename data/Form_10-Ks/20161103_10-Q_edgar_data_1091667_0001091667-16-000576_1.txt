The United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) allows us to  incorporate by reference  information that we file with the SEC, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents.

Explanatory Note 
  On May 18, 2016, Charter Communications, Inc. (formerly known as CCH I, LLC, the  Company  or  Charter ) completed its previously reported merger transactions among Charter, Time Warner Cable Inc. ( Legacy TWC ), Charter Communications, Inc. ( Legacy Charter ), and certain other subsidiaries of Charter (the  TWC Transaction ). Also on May 18, 2016, Charter completed its previously reported acquisition of Bright House Networks, LLC ( Legacy Bright House ) from Advance/Newhouse Partnership (the  Bright House Transaction,  and, together with the TWC Transaction, the  Transactions ).  As a result of the Transactions, Charter became the new public parent company that holds the combined operations of Legacy Charter, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House and was renamed Charter Communications, Inc. The financial statements presented in this quarterly report reflect the operations of Legacy Charter through May 17, 2016 and the Company on and after May 18, 2016. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2,  Mergers and Acquisitions - Selected Pro Forma Financial Information  for certain financial information presented as if the Transactions had closed on January 1, 2015. Also see Exhibit 99.1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 for pro forma financial information for each quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarter of 2016.  Throughout this report references to the  Company  or to  Charter  refer to the combined company following the completion of the Transactions. 
    
  As a result of the Transactions and by operation of Rule 12g-3(c) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), Charter is the successor issuer to Legacy Charter and succeeds to the attributes of Legacy Charter as the registrant.  Charter s Class A common stock is deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Charter is subject to the Exchange Act to the same extent as Legacy Charter.

1.    Organization and Basis of Presentation  
    
  Organization  
    
  Charter Communications, Inc. (together with its controlled subsidiaries,  Charter,  or the  Company ) is the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications company providing video, Internet and voice services to residential and business customers.  The Company also sells video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers, and networking and enterprise-class, cloud-enabled hosting, managed applications and transport services to business customers and owns and operates regional sports networks and local sports, news and lifestyle channels.  The Company s residential services also include security and home management services.    
    
  Charter is a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Charter Communications Holdings, LLC ( Charter Holdings ), an indirect owner of Charter Communications Operating, LLC ( Charter Operating ) under which substantially all of the operations reside. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions among consolidated entities have been eliminated. 
    
  The Company s operations are managed and reported to its Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), the Company s chief operating decision maker, on a consolidated basis. The CEO assesses performance and allocates resources based on the consolidated results of operations. Under this organizational and reporting structure, the Company has   one   reportable segment, cable services. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).   Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures typically included in Charter s Annual Report on Form 10-K have been condensed or omitted for this quarterly report.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited and are subject to review by regulatory authorities.  However, in the opinion of management, such financial statements include all adjustments, which consist of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.      
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Areas involving significant judgments and estimates include capitalization of labor and overhead costs; depreciation and amortization costs; purchase accounting valuations of assets and liabilities including, but not limited to, property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill; pension benefits; income taxes; contingencies and programming expense.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

2.         Mergers and Acquisitions 
    
  TWC Transaction 
    
  On May 18, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Mergers dated as of May 23, 2015 (the  Merger Agreement ), by and among Time Warner Cable Inc. ( Legacy TWC ), Charter Communications, Inc. prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement ( Legacy Charter ), CCH I, LLC, previously a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Charter ( New Charter ) and certain other subsidiaries of New Charter were completed (the  TWC Transaction,  and together with the Bright House Transaction described below, the  Transactions ).  As a result of the TWC Transaction, New Charter became the new public parent company that holds the operations of the combined companies and was renamed Charter Communications, Inc.  
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the TWC Transaction, each outstanding share of Legacy TWC common stock (other than Legacy TWC common stock held by Liberty Broadband Corporation ( Liberty Broadband ) and Liberty Interactive Corporation ( Liberty Interactive  and, collectively, the  Liberty Parties )), was converted into the right to receive, at the option of each such holder of Legacy TWC common stock, either (a)   $100   in cash and Charter Class A common stock equivalent to   0.5409   shares of Legacy Charter Class A common stock (the  Option A Consideration ) or (b)   $115   in cash and Charter Class A common stock equivalent to   0.4562   shares of Legacy Charter Class A common stock (the  Option B

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
  (dollars in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated) 

Consideration ). The actual number of shares of Charter Class A common stock that Legacy TWC stockholders received, excluding the Liberty Parties, was calculated by multiplying the exchange ratios of   0.5409   or   0.4562   specified above by   0.9042   (the  Parent Merger Exchange Ratio ), which was also the exchange ratio that was used to determine the number of shares of Charter Class A common stock that Legacy Charter stockholders received per share of Legacy Charter Class A common stock.  Such exchange ratio did not impact the aggregate value represented by the shares of Charter Class A common stock issued in the TWC Transaction; however, it did impact the actual number of shares issued in the TWC Transaction.   
    
  Out of approximately   277 million   shares of TWC common stock outstanding at the closing of the TWC Transaction, excluding TWC common stock held by the Liberty Parties, approximately   274 million   shares were converted into the right to receive the Option A Consideration and approximately   3 million   shares were converted into the right to receive the Option B Consideration.  The Liberty Parties received approximately   one   share of Charter Class A common stock for each share of Legacy TWC common stock they owned (equivalent to   1.106   shares of Legacy Charter Class A common stock multiplied by the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio).   
    
  As of the date of completion of the Transactions, the total value of the TWC Transaction was approximately   $85 billion  , including cash, equity and Legacy TWC assumed debt.  The purchase price also included an estimated pre-combination vesting period fair value of   $514 million   for Legacy TWC equity awards converted into Charter awards upon closing of the TWC Transaction ( Converted TWC Awards ) and   $69 million   of cash paid to former Legacy TWC employees and non-employee directors who held equity awards, whether vested or not vested.  
    
  Bright House Transaction 
    
  Also, on May 18, 2016, Legacy Charter and Advance/Newhouse Partnership ( A/N ), the former parent of Bright House Networks, LLC ( Bright House ), completed their previously announced transaction, pursuant to a definitive Contribution Agreement (the  Contribution Agreement ), under which Charter acquired Bright House (the  Bright House Transaction ).  Pursuant to the Bright House Transaction, Charter became the owner of the membership interests in Bright House and the other assets primarily related to Bright House (other than certain excluded assets and liabilities and non-operating cash).  As of the date of acquisition, the purchase price totaled approximately   $12.2 billion   consisting of (a)   $2.0 billion   in cash, (b)   25 million   convertible preferred units of Charter Holdings with a face amount of   $2.5 billion   that pay a   6%   annual preferential dividend, (c) approximately   31.0 million   common units of Charter Holdings that are exchangeable into Charter Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis and (d)   one   share of Charter Class B common stock.  See Note 9 for conversion features of the Charter Holdings preferred units and common units and Note 8 for the terms of the Charter Class B common stock. 
    
  Liberty Transaction  
    
  In connection with the TWC Transaction, Legacy Charter and Liberty Broadband completed their previously announced transactions pursuant to their investment agreement, in which Liberty Broadband purchased for cash approximately   22.0 million   shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at   $4.3 billion   at the closing of the TWC Transaction to partially finance the cash portion of the TWC Transaction consideration, and in connection with the Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband purchased approximately   3.7 million   shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at   $700 million   at the closing of the Bright House Transaction (the  Liberty Transaction ).  
    
  Financing for the Transactions 
    
  Charter partially financed the cash portion of the purchase price of the Transactions with additional indebtedness and cash on hand.  In 2015, Legacy Charter issued   $15.5 billion   aggregate principal amount of CCO Safari II, LLC ( CCO Safari II ) senior secured notes,   $3.8 billion   aggregate principal amount of CCO Safari III, LLC ( CCO Safari III ) senior secured bank loans and   $2.5 billion   aggregate principal amount of CCOH Safari, LLC ( CCOH Safari ) senior unsecured notes.  The net proceeds were initially deposited into escrow accounts.  Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, the proceeds were released from escrow and the CCOH Safari notes became obligations of CCO Holdings, LLC ( CCO Holdings ), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Charter Holdings, and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. ( CCO Holdings Capital ), and the CCO Safari II notes and CCO Safari III credit facilities became obligations of Charter Operating and Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp. CCOH Safari merged into CCO Holdings and CCO Safari II and CCO Safari III merged into Charter Operating.  In connection with the closing of the Bright House Transaction, Charter Operating closed on a   $2.6 billion   aggregate principal amount term loan A facility ( Term Loan A ).  See Note 7.

Acquisition Accounting 
    
  The Transactions enable Charter to apply its operating strategy to a larger set of assets, accelerate product development and innovation through greater scale as well as more effectively compete in medium and large commercial markets.  The operating results of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House have been included in the Company s consolidated statements of operations for the period from the date of the Transactions through   September 30, 2016  .  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues included in the Company s consolidated statements of operations were   $6.4 billion   and   $9.5 billion  , respectively, and consolidated net income was   $83 million   and   $319 million  , respectively, for Legacy TWC. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues included in the Company s consolidated statements of operations were   $1.0 billion   and   $1.5 billion  , respectively, and consolidated net income was   $84 million   and   $125 million  , respectively, for Legacy Bright House.  Consolidated net income includes non-operating expenses such as interest expense and income taxes based on what is included in the respective legal entities and does not include allocations of additional corporate level non-operating expenses. 
    
  Charter applied acquisition accounting to the Transactions. The total purchase price was allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.  The fair values were primarily based on third-party valuations using assumptions developed by management and other information compiled by management including, but not limited to, future expected cash flows.  The excess of the purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill.  Goodwill recognized in the Transactions is representative of resources that do not meet the definition of an identifiable intangible asset and include buy-side synergies, economies of scale of the combined operations, increased market share, assembled workforces and improved credit rating.   
    
  The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were preliminarily determined using the income, cost and market approaches.  The fair values were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement, other than long-term debt assumed in the TWC Transaction which represents a Level 1 measurement.  See Note 11.  
    
  Property, plant and equipment was valued utilizing the cost approach.  The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of all forms of depreciation as of the appraisal date as described below: 

Physical depreciation - the loss in value or usefulness attributable solely to use of the asset and physical causes such as wear and tear and exposure to the elements. 
                
    Functional obsolescence - the loss in value due to factors inherent in the asset itself and due to changes in technology, design or process resulting in inadequacy, overcapacity, lack of functional utility or excess operating costs. 
                
    Economic obsolescence - the loss in value due to unfavorable external conditions such as economics of the industry or geographic area, or change in ordinances. 
       
  The cost approach relies on assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment.  
    
  Franchise rights and customer relationships were valued using an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flows attributable to each of the intangible assets identified.  See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information on the income approach model.  The weighted average life of customer relationships acquired in the TWC Transaction and Bright House Transaction was   11   years and   10   years, respectively.  
    
  The fair value of equity investments was based on either applying implied multiples to estimated cash flows or utilizing a discounted cash flow model. The implied multiples were estimated based on precedent transactions and comparable companies. The discounted cash flow model required estimating the present value of future cash flows of the investee.   
    
  Legacy TWC long-term debt assumed was adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices.  At the acquisition date, the quoted market values of all but two of Legacy TWC s bonds were higher than the principal amount of the related debt instrument, which resulted in the recognition of a net debt premium of approximately   $2.4 billion  .  The quoted market value of a debt instrument is

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
  (dollars in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated) 

higher than the principal amount of the debt when the market interest rates are lower than the stated interest rate of the debt. This debt premium is amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the applicable debt. 
    
  Generally, no fair value adjustments were reflected in current assets and current liabilities as carrying value is estimated to approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of the items.  However, fair value adjustments were reflected in other noncurrent assets and other long-term liabilities relating to contract-based assets and liabilities, capital lease obligations, deferred liabilities and pension liabilities.  Out-of-market contract-based assets and liabilities relating to non-cancelable executory contracts and operating leases were recognized based on discounted cash flow models to the extent the terms of the non-cancelable contracts are favorable or unfavorable compared with the relative market terms of the same or similar contract at the acquisition date.  The out-of-market element will be amortized as if the contract were consummated at market terms on the acquisition date.  Capital lease obligations were measured at fair value based on the present value of amounts to be paid under the lease agreement using a market participant discount rate.  Deferred liabilities were not recorded in acquisition accounting to the extent there was no associated payment obligation or substantive performance obligation.  The pension liabilities assumed in the TWC Transaction are measured at fair value based on an actuarially determined projected benefit obligation, less the fair value of pension investments, as of the acquisition date. See Note 19 for fair value assumptions considered in acquisition accounting for the pension liabilities. 
    
  An adjustment was recorded for the deferred tax impact of acquisition accounting adjustments primarily related to property, plant and equipment, franchises, customer relationships and assumed Legacy TWC long-term debt. The incremental deferred tax liabilities were calculated primarily based on the tax effect of the step-up in book basis of net assets of Legacy TWC excluding the amount attributable to nondeductible goodwill. 
    
  The Charter Class A common stock issued to Legacy TWC stockholders and Charter Holdings common units issued to A/N were valued based on the opening share price of Charter Class A common stock on the acquisition date.  The convertible preferred units of Charter Holdings issued to A/N were valued at approximately   $3.2 billion   based on a binomial lattice model for convertible bonds that models the future changes in the common equity value of Charter.  The valuation relies on management s assumptions including risk-free interest rate, volatility and discount yield.  The pre-combination vesting period fair value of the Converted TWC Awards was based on the portion of the requisite service period completed at the acquisition date by Legacy TWC employee award holders applied to the total fair value of the Converted TWC Awards. See Note 18 for fair value assumptions considered in acquisition accounting for the Converted TWC Awards.  
    
  The allocation of the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and certain liabilities is preliminary and is subject to change based on finalization and review of such valuations.  During the measurement period, the Company will continue to obtain information to assist in finalizing the fair value of net assets acquired, which may differ materially from the preliminary estimates. The Company will apply any measurement period adjustments, including any related impacts to net income (loss), in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined.  The tables below present the calculation of the purchase price and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Transactions.

The accreted values presented in the table above represent the principal amount of the debt less the original issue discount at the time of sale, deferred financing costs, and, (i) in regards to the Legacy TWC debt assumed, a fair value premium adjustment as a result of applying acquisition accounting plus the accretion of those amounts to the balance sheet date and (ii) in regards to the fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated notes (the  Sterling Notes ), a remeasurement of the principal amount of the debt and any premium or discount into US dollars as of the balance sheet date.  See Note 10.  However, the amount that is currently payable if the debt becomes immediately due is equal to the principal amount of the debt.  The Company has availability under the Charter Operating credit facilities of approximately   $2.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  CCO Holdings 
    
  In February 2016, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital jointly issued   $1.7 billion   aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   senior notes due 2024 (the  2024 Notes ) and, in April 2016, they issued   $1.5 billion   aggregate principal amount of   5.500%   senior notes due 2026 (the  2026 Notes ) at a price of   100.075%   of the aggregate principal amount.  The net proceeds from both issuances were used to repurchase all of CCO Holdings    7.000%   senior notes due 2019,   7.375%   senior notes due 2020 and   6.500%   senior notes due 2021 and to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.  These debt repurchases resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $110 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes are senior debt obligations of CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital and rank equally with all other current and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital. They are structurally subordinated to all obligations of subsidiaries of CCO Holdings. 
    
  CCO Holdings may redeem some or all of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes at any time with a make-whole premium. Beginning in 2019 for the 2024 notes and 2021 for the 2026 notes, the optional redemption price declines to   100%   of the respective series  principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. 
    
  In addition, at any time prior to April 1, 2019 in regards to the 2024 Notes and May 1, 2019 in regards to the 2026 Notes, CCO Holdings may redeem up to   40%   of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes at a premium plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings (as defined in the indenture);

provided that certain conditions are met.  In the event of specified change of control events, CCO Holdings must offer to purchase the outstanding CCO Holdings notes from the holders at a purchase price equal to   101%   of the total principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 
    
  In April 2015, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital closed on transactions in which they issued   $1.15 billion   aggregate principal amount of   5.125%   senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the  2023 Notes ),   $750 million   aggregate principal amount of   5.375%   senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the  2025 Notes ) and   $800 million   aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the  2027 Notes  and collectively, the  Notes ). The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes were used to finance tender offers and a subsequent call in which   $1.0 billion   aggregate principal amount of CCO Holdings  outstanding   7.250%   senior notes due 2017 and   $700 million   aggregate principal amount of CCO Holdings  outstanding   8.125%   senior notes due 2020 were repurchased, as well as for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes were used to call   $800 million   of the   $1.4 billion   aggregate principal amount of CCO Holdings  outstanding   7.000%   senior notes due 2019. These debt repurchases resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $123 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The Company also recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately   $5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as a result of the repayment of debt upon termination of the proposed transactions with Comcast Corporation ( Comcast ). 
    
  Charter Operating 
    
  In connection with the closing of the TWC Transaction, Charter Operating replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a new   $3.0 billion   senior secured revolving credit facility under Charter Operating s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated May 18, 2016 (the  Credit Agreement ).  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $220 million   of the revolving credit facility was utilized to collateralize   $325 million   of letters of credit issued on the Company s behalf.  In connection with the closing of the Bright House Transaction, Charter Operating closed on a   $2.6 billion   aggregate principal amount Term Loan A pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement of which   $2.0 billion   was used to fund the cash portion of the Bright House Transaction and of which   $638 million   was used to prepay and terminate Charter Operating s existing Term A-1 Loans.  Interest on Term Loan A was set at LIBOR plus   2%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate principal amount of Charter Operating s credit facilities was   $9.0 billion  ,   which includes   $3.8 billion   aggregate principal amount of CCO Safari III credit facilities that became obligations of Charter Operating upon the closing of the TWC Transaction.  
    
  The Credit Agreement and the Charter Operating senior notes are guaranteed by CCO Holdings, TWC, LLC (as defined below), TWCE (as defined below) and substantially all of the operating subsidiaries of Charter Operating (collectively, the  Subsidiary Guarantors ).  Term Loan A and borrowings under the incremental revolving credit facility are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Charter Operating and the Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to certain customary exceptions and the liens rank equally with the liens on the collateral securing obligations under the Charter Operating notes and credit facilities and the Time Warner Cable, LLC (the successor to Legacy TWC outstanding debt obligations,  TWC, LLC ) senior notes and debentures and the Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC ( TWCE ) senior debentures assumed in the TWC Transaction.   
    
  Assumed Legacy TWC Indebtedness 
    
  Charter assumed approximately   $22.4 billion   in aggregate principal amount of TWC, LLC senior notes and debentures and TWCE senior debentures with varying maturities.  The Company applied acquisition accounting to Legacy TWC, and as a result, the debt assumed was adjusted to fair value using quoted market values as of the closing date.  This fair value adjustment resulted in recognition of a net debt premium of approximately   $2.4 billion  .   
    
  TWC, LLC Senior Notes and Debentures 
    
  The TWC, LLC senior notes and debentures are guaranteed by CCO Holdings, Charter Operating, TWCE and the Subsidiary Guarantors and rank equally with the liens on the collateral securing obligations under the Charter Operating notes and credit facilities.

The TWC, LLC indenture also contains customary events of default. 
    
  The TWC, LLC senior notes and debentures may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at TWC, LLC s option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) all of the applicable principal amount being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the applicable TWC, LLC senior notes and debentures discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (with the exception of the Sterling Notes, which are on an annual basis), at a comparable government bond rate plus a designated number of basis points as further described in the indenture and the applicable note or debenture, plus, in each case, accrued but unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. 
    
  The Company may offer to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Sterling Notes in the event of certain changes in the tax laws of the U.S. (or any taxing authority in the U.S.). This redemption would be at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the Sterling Notes to, but not including, the redemption date. 
    
  TWCE Senior Debentures 
    
  The TWCE senior debentures are guaranteed by CCO Holdings, Charter Operating, TWC, LLC and the Subsidiary Guarantors and rank equally with the liens on the collateral securing obligations under the Charter Operating notes and credit facilities.  Interest on each series of TWCE senior debentures is payable semi-annually in arrears. The TWCE senior debentures are not redeemable before maturity. 
    
  The TWCE indenture contains customary covenants relating to restrictions on the ability of TWCE or any material subsidiary to create liens and on the ability of TWC, LLC and TWCE to consolidate, merge or convey or transfer substantially all of their assets. The TWCE indenture also contains customary events of default.  
    
  Liquidity and Future Principal Payments 
    
  The Company continues to have significant amounts of debt, and its business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on its debt, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.  As set forth below, the Company has significant future principal payments.  The Company continues to monitor the capital markets, and it expects to undertake refinancing transactions and utilize free cash flow and cash on hand to further extend or reduce the maturities of its principal obligations.  The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions. 
    
  Based on outstanding indebtedness as of   September 30, 2016  , the amortization of term loans, and the maturity dates for all senior and subordinated notes and debentures, total future principal payments on the total borrowings under all debt agreements as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows:

  In connection with the closing of the Bright House Transaction, Charter Holdings issued approximately   31.0 million   common units to A/N, which are exchangeable at any time into either Charter Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, or, at Charter s option, cash, based on the then current market price of Charter Class A common stock. Net income (loss) of Charter Holdings attributable to A/N s common noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes is based on the effective common ownership interest of approximately   10%  , and was   $24 million   and   $53 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Charter Holdings also issued approximately   25 million   convertible preferred units to A/N with a face amount of   $2.5 billion   that pay a   6%   annual preferred dividend.  The   6%   annual preferred dividend is paid quarterly in cash, if and when declared, provided that, if dividends are suspended at any time, the dividends will accrue until they are paid.  Net income (loss) of Charter Holdings attributable to the preferred noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes is based on the preferred dividend which was   $37 million   and   $55 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Each convertible preferred unit is convertible into either   0.37334   of a Charter Holdings common unit (if then held by A/N) or   0.37334   of a share of Charter Class A common stock (if then held by a third party), representing a conversion price of   $267.85   per unit, based on a conversion feature as defined in the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Charter Holdings.  After May 18, 2021, Charter may redeem the convertible preferred units if the price of Charter Class A common stock exceeds   130%   of the conversion price. These Charter Holdings common and convertible preferred units held by A/N are recorded in noncontrolling interests as permanent equity on the consolidated balance sheet.  
    
  The common units and convertible preferred units issued to A/N as consideration for the Bright House Transaction were initially measured at their fair value of   $7.0 billion   and   $3.2 billion  , respectively, in accordance with acquisition accounting. However, upon formation of Charter Holdings, the carrying amounts of the controlling and noncontrolling interests were adjusted to reflect the relative effective common ownership interest in Charter Holdings. In addition, noncontrolling interest and additional paid-in capital were adjusted during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due to changes in Charter Holdings  ownership.  These adjustments resulted in an increase to noncontrolling interest of approximately   $587 million   and a corresponding decrease to additional paid-in capital of   $587 million  , net of   $225 million   of deferred income taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

10.     Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
    
  The Company uses derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk on variable debt and foreign exchange risk on the Sterling Notes, and does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
    
  Interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage interest costs and to reduce the Company s exposure to increases in floating interest rates.  The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.  Using interest rate derivative instruments, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals through 2017, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed-upon notional principal amounts.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $1.1 billion   in notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments outstanding.  The notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of exposure to credit loss.  The amounts exchanged were determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the contracts. 
    
  Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, the Company acquired interest rate derivative instrument assets with a fair value of   $85 million   (excluding accrued interest), which were terminated and settled with their respective counterparties in the second quarter of 2016 with an   $88 million   cash payment to the Company of which   $14 million   was for interest accrued through the date of

termination. The termination resulted in an   $11 million   loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   which was recorded in gain (loss) on financial instruments, net in the consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, the Company assumed cross-currency derivative instrument liabilities with a fair value of   $72 million   (excluding accrued interest).  Cross-currency derivative instruments are used to effectively convert    1.275 billion   aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate U.S. dollar denominated debt. The cross-currency swaps have maturities of June 2031 and July 2042. The Company is required to post collateral on the cross-currency derivative instruments when the derivative contracts are in a liability position. In May 2016, the Company entered into a collateral holiday agreement for   80%   of both the 2031 and 2042 cross-currency swaps, which eliminates the requirement to post collateral for   three   years.   
    
  The effect of derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets is presented in the table below: 

The Company s interest rate and cross-currency derivative instruments are not designated as hedges and are marked to fair value each period, with the impact recorded as a gain or loss on financial instruments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.  While these derivative instruments are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, management continues to believe such instruments are closely correlated with the respective debt, thus managing associated risk.   
    
  The effect of financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations is presented in the table below.

11.    Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The accounting guidance     establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements, based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, as follows: 

Level 1   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
                
    Level 2   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
                
    Level 3   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
       
  Financial Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies.  Considerable judgment, however, is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange.  
    
  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.   
    
  The Company s cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016   and restricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 were primarily invested in money market funds and 90 day or less commercial paper.  The money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor from an actively traded exchange and commercial paper is valued at cost plus the accretion of the discount on a yield to maturity basis, which approximates fair value.  The money market funds and commercial paper potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk.  The amount invested within any one financial instrument did not exceed   $250 million   and   $1.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were no significant concentrations of financial instruments in a single investee, industry or geographic location.  
    
  Interest rate derivative instruments are valued using a present value calculation based on an implied forward LIBOR curve (adjusted for Charter Operating s and counterparties  credit risk). The weighted average pay rate for the Company s currently effective interest rate derivative instruments was   1.61%   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (exclusive of applicable spreads).  The cross-currency derivative instruments are valued using a present value calculation based on expected forward interest and exchange rates (adjusted for Charter Operating s and counterparties  credit risk).   
    
  Financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis are presented in the table below.

  (dollars in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated) 

A summary of the carrying value and fair value of debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows:  

The estimated fair value of the Company s senior notes and debentures as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is based on quoted market prices in active markets and is classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy, while the estimated fair value of the Company s credit facilities is based on quoted market prices in inactive markets and is classified within Level 2.  
    
  Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The Company s nonfinancial assets such as equity-method investments, franchises, property, plant, and equipment, and other intangible assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence that an impairment may exist.  No impairments were recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Upon closing of the Transactions, all of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House nonfinancial assets and liabilities were recorded at preliminary fair values.  See Note 2. 

12.     Operating Costs and Expenses 
    
  Operating costs and expenses, exclusive of items shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations, consist of the following for the periods presented: 

Programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, premium, digital, video on demand, and pay-per-view programming. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content costs represent payments to franchise and regulatory authorities, costs directly related to providing video, Internet and voice services as well as payments for sports, local and news content produced by the Company.  Costs to service customers include costs related to field operations, network operations and customer care for the Company s residential and small and medium business customers, including internal and third-party labor for installations, service and repairs, maintenance, billing and collection, occupancy and vehicle costs. Marketing costs represent the costs of marketing to current and potential commercial and residential customers including labor costs. Transition costs represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the TWC and Bright House operations and to increase the scale of the Company s business as a result of the Transactions.  See Note 2.

14.    Income Taxes  
    
  Substantially all of the Company s operations are held through Charter Holdings and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Charter Holdings and the majority of its subsidiaries are generally limited liability companies that are not subject to income tax. However, certain of these limited liability companies are subject to state income tax. In addition, the subsidiaries that are corporations are subject to state income tax. Generally, the taxable income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of Charter Holdings are passed through to its members, Charter and A/N. Charter is responsible for its share of taxable income or loss of Charter Holdings allocated to it in accordance with the CCH Limited Liability Company Agreement ( LLC Agreement ) and partnership tax rules and regulations. Charter also records financial statement deferred tax assets and liabilities related to its investment, and its underlying net assets, in Charter Holdings. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $16 million   of income tax expense and   $3.1 billion   of income tax benefit, respectively. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded   $142 million   and   $72 million   of income tax benefit, respectively. Income tax expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was offset by a change in a state tax law that resulted in approximately   $44 million    of tax benefit.  Income tax benefit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was recognized primarily through the reversal of approximately   $3.3 billion   of valuation allowance (see further discussion below), net of tax effect of permanent differences, a decrease to the anticipated blended state rate applied to Legacy Charter deferred tax balances as a result of the Transactions, a change in a state tax law, and prior to the closing of the Transactions, increases (decreases) in deferred tax liabilities related to Charter s franchises which are characterized as indefinite-lived for book financial reporting purposes. Income tax benefit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily the result of the deemed liquidation of Charter Holdco in July 2015. The tax provision in future periods will vary based on future operating results, as well as future book versus tax differences. 
    
  Charter Holdings, the indirect owner of the Company s cable systems, generally allocates its taxable income, gains, losses, deductions and credits proportionately according to the members  respective ownership interests, except for special allocations required under Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations ( Section 704(c) ).  Pursuant to Section 704(c) and the LLC Agreement, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the partnership shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the members so as to take into account any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its initial gross asset value using the  traditional method  as described in the Treasury Regulations. 
    
  Under the LLC Agreement, A/N has rights to: (1) convert at any time some or all of its preferred units in Charter Holdings for common units in Charter Holdings, and (2) exchange at any time some or all of its common units in Charter Holdings for Charter s Class A common stock or cash, at Charter s option. Pursuant to a tax receivable agreement between Charter and A/N, Charter must pay to A/N   50%   of the tax benefit when realized by Charter from the step-up in tax basis resulting from any future exchange or sale of the preferred and common units. Charter has not recorded a liability for this obligation since the tax benefit is dependent on uncertain future events that are outside of Charter s control, such as the timing of a conversion or exchange. A future exchange or sale is not based on a fixed and determinable date and the exchange or sale is not certain to occur. If and when an exchange or sale occurs in the future, the undiscounted value of the obligation is currently estimated to be in the range of   zero   to   $3 billion   depending on measurement of the tax step-up in the future and Charter s ability to realize the tax benefit in the periods following the exchange or sale.  Factors impacting these calculations include, but are not limited to, the fair value of the equity at the time of the exchange and the effective tax rates when the benefits are realized. 
    
  Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, Charter experienced a third  ownership change  as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code; resulting in a third set of limitations on Charter s use of its existing federal and state net operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryforwards. Both the first ownership change limitations that applied as a result of Legacy Charter s emergence from bankruptcy in 2009 and second ownership change limitations that applied as a result of Liberty Media Corporation s purchase in 2013 of a   27%   beneficial interest in Legacy Charter will also continue to apply. Since the limitation amounts accumulate for future use to the extent they are not utilized in any given year, Charter believes its loss carryforwards should become fully available to offset future taxable income. Charter s state loss carryforwards are subject to similar, but varying, limitations on their future use. If Charter was to experience another  ownership change  in the future, its ability to use its loss carryforwards could be subject to further limitations. 
    
  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account  

24 

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
  (dollars in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated) 

various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Due to Legacy Charter s history of losses, Legacy Charter was historically unable to assume future taxable income in its analysis and accordingly valuation allowances were established against the deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, from definite-lived assets for book accounting purposes. However, as a result of the TWC Transaction, deferred tax liabilities resulting from the book fair value adjustment increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized, is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that the Company will realize substantially all of its deferred tax assets. As a result, Charter reversed approximately   $3.3 billion   of its valuation allowance and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Approximately   $15 million   of valuation allowance associated with state loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax assets remains on the   September 30, 2016   consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  In determining the Company s tax provision for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be  more likely than not  of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. There is considerable judgment involved in making such a determination. In connection with the TWC Transaction, the Company assumed   $218 million   of gross unrecognized tax benefits (net of return to provision adjustments), including interest and penalties, which are recorded within other long-term liabilities. The net amount of the unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate is   $156 million  .  There were   $4 million   of additional increases to the Company s unrecognized tax benefits during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company does not currently anticipate that its reserve for uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease during 2016; however, various events could cause the Company s current expectations to change in the future. These uncertain tax positions, if ever recognized in the financial statements, would be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as part of the income tax provision. 
    
  No tax years for Charter, Charter Holdings, or Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the IRS. Legacy Charter s tax years ending 2012 through the short period return dated May 17, 2016 remain subject to examination and assessment. Years prior to 2012 remain open solely for purposes of examination of Legacy Charter s loss and credit carryforwards. The IRS is currently examining Legacy TWC s income tax returns for 2011 and 2012.  Legacy TWC s tax years ending 2013 through 2015 remain subject to examination and assessment.  Prior to Legacy TWC s separation from Time Warner Inc. ( Time Warner ) in March 2009 (the  Separation ), Legacy TWC was included in the consolidated U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns of Time Warner. The IRS is currently examining Time Warner s 2008 through 2010 income tax returns. Time Warner s income tax returns for 2005 to 2007, which are periods prior to the separation, were settled with the exception of an immaterial item that has been referred to the IRS Appeals Division.  The Company does not anticipate that these examinations will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. In addition, the Company is also subject to ongoing examinations of the Company s tax returns by state and local tax authorities for various periods. Activity related to these state and local examinations did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations in 2015, nor does the Company anticipate a material impact in the future.

15.    Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to Charter shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock and if-converted methods and is based on the weighted average number of shares used for the basic earnings per share calculation, adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, equity awards with market conditions and Charter Holdings convertible preferred units and common units.  Weighted average number of shares outstanding for all periods presented has been recast to reflect the application of the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio.  Basic loss per common share equals diluted loss per common share for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   because the Company incurred a net loss during that period. The following is the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

16.         Related Party Transactions  
    
  On May 23, 2015, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the amendment of the Contribution Agreement, Charter entered into the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement with Liberty Broadband, A/N and Legacy Charter (the  Stockholders Agreement ). As of the closing of the Merger Agreement and the Contribution Agreement on May 18, 2016, the Stockholders Agreement replaced Legacy Charter s existing stockholders agreement with Liberty Broadband, dated September 29, 2014, and superseded the amended and restated stockholders agreement among Legacy Charter, Charter, Liberty Broadband and A/N, dated March 31, 2015.  
    
  Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the number of Charter s directors is fixed at 13, and includes its chief executive officer. Upon the closing of the Bright House Transaction, two designees selected by A/N became members of the board of directors of Charter and three designees selected by Liberty Broadband continued as members of the board of directors of Charter. The remaining eight directors are not affiliated with either A/N or Liberty Broadband.  Each of A/N and Liberty Broadband is entitled

to nominate at least one director to each of the committees of Charter s board of directors, subject to applicable stock exchange listing rules and certain specified voting or equity ownership thresholds for each of A/N and Liberty Broadband, and provided that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefit Committee each have at least a majority of directors independent from A/N, Liberty Broadband and the Company (referred to as the  unaffiliated directors ). Each of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee is currently comprised of three unaffiliated directors, including one designee of each of A/N and Liberty Broadband. A/N and Liberty Broadband also have certain other committee designation and other governance rights.  Upon the closing of the Bright House Transaction, Mr. Thomas Rutledge, the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), became the chairman of the board of Charter. 
    
  The Company is aware that Dr. John Malone may be deemed to have a   36.4%   voting interest in Liberty Interactive and is Chairman of the board of directors, an executive officer position, of Liberty Interactive.  Liberty Interactive owns   38.3%   of the common stock of HSN, Inc. ( HSN ) and has the right to elect   20%   of the board members of HSN.  Liberty Interactive wholly owns QVC, Inc. ( QVC ).  The Company has programming relationships with HSN and QVC which pre-date the transaction with Liberty Media.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded payments in aggregate of approximately   $18 million   and   $33 million  , respectively, and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded payments in aggregate of approximately   $4 million   and   $12 million  , respectively, from HSN and QVC as part of channel carriage fees and revenue sharing arrangements for home shopping sales made to customers in the Company s footprint.   
    
  Dr. Malone and Mr. Steven Miron, each a member of Charter s board of directors, also serve on the board of directors of Discovery Communications, Inc., ( Discovery ) and the Company is aware that Dr. Malone owns   4.9%   in the aggregate of the common stock of Discovery and has a   28.6%   voting interest in Discovery for the election of directors.  The Company is aware that Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership ( A/N PP ), an affiliate of A/N and in which Mr. Miron is the CEO, owns   100%   of the Series A preferred stock of Discovery and   100%   of the Series C preferred stock of Discovery, representing approximately   34.0%   of the outstanding equity of Discovery s stock, on an as-converted basis. A/N PP has the right to appoint three directors out of a total of ten directors to Discovery s board to be elected by the holders of Discovery s Series A preferred stock.  In addition, Dr. Malone owns approximately   6.4%   in the aggregate of the common stock of Starz and has   48.1%   of the voting power, pursuant to certain irrevocable proxies granted by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and his ownership of common stock.  Mr. Gregory Maffei, a member of Charter s board of directors, is a non-executive Chairman of the board of Starz.  The Company purchases programming from both Discovery and Starz pursuant to agreements entered into prior to Dr. Malone, Mr. Maffei and Mr. Miron joining Charter s board of directors.  Based on publicly available information, the Company does not believe that either Discovery or Starz would currently be considered related parties.  The amounts paid in aggregate to Discovery and Starz represent less than   3%   of total operating costs and expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   
    
  The Company has agreements with certain equity-method investees (see Note 5) pursuant to which the Company has made or received related party transaction payments.

Leases and rental costs charged to expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $79 million   and   $12 million  , respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $136 million   and   $36 million  , respectively.   
    
  (2)  The Company pays programming fees under multi-year contracts ranging from   three   to   ten   years, typically based on a flat fee per customer, which may be fixed for the term, or may in some cases escalate over the term.  Programming costs included in the statement of operations were   $2.4 billion   and   $667 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $4.6 billion   and   $2.0 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Certain of the Company s programming agreements are based on a flat fee per month or have guaranteed minimum payments.  The table sets forth the aggregate guaranteed minimum commitments under the Company s programming contracts. 
    
  (3)   Other  represents other guaranteed minimum commitments, including programming rights negotiated directly with content owners for distribution on Company-owned channels or networks and commitments related to the Company s role as an advertising and distribution sales agent for third party-owned channels or networks as well as commitments to the Company s customer premise equipment vendors. 
    
  The following items are not included in the contractual obligation table due to various factors discussed below.  However, the Company incurs these costs as part of its operations: 

The Company rents utility poles used in its operations.  Generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but the Company anticipates that such rentals will recur.  Rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $36 million   and   $13 million  , respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $74 million   and   $39 million  , respectively.   

The Company pays franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year.  The Company also pays other franchise related costs, such as public education grants, under multi-year agreements.  Franchise fees and other franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $177 million   and   $52 million  , respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $356 million   and   $158 million  , respectively. 

The Company also has   $325 million   in letters of credit, of which   $220 million   is secured under the Charter Operating credit facility, primarily to its various worker s compensation, property and casualty, and general liability carriers, as collateral for reimbursement of claims.

Litigation  
    
  In 2014, following an announcement by Comcast and Legacy TWC of their intent to merge, Breffni Barrett and others filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York against Comcast, Legacy TWC and their respective officers and directors.  Later five similar class actions were consolidated with this matter (the  NY Actions ). The NY Actions were settled in July 2014, however, such settlement was terminated following the termination of the Comcast and TWC merger in April 2015.  In May 2015, Charter and TWC announced their intent to merge.  Subsequently, the parties in the NY Actions filed a Second Consolidated Class Action Complaint (the  Second Amended Complaint ), removing Comcast as a defendant and naming TWC, the members of the TWC board of directors, Charter and the merger subsidiaries as defendants. The Second Amended Complaint generally alleges, among other things, that the members of the TWC board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to TWC stockholders during the Charter merger negotiations and by entering into the merger agreement and approving the mergers, and that Charter aided and abetted such breaches of fiduciary duties. The complaint sought, among other relief, injunctive relief enjoining the stockholder vote on the mergers, unspecified declaratory and equitable relief, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, and costs and attorneys  fees.  
    
  In September 2015, the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ) to settle the action. Pursuant to the MOU, the defendants issued certain supplemental disclosures relating to the mergers on a Form 8-K, and plaintiffs agreed to release with prejudice all claims that could have been asserted against defendants in connection with the mergers. The settlement is conditioned on, among other things, approval by the New York Supreme Court. That court gave preliminary approval to the settlement in October 2016. A hearing to consider final approval of this settlement is set for March 2017.  In the event that the New York Supreme Court does not approve the settlement, the defendants intend to vigorously defend against any further litigation.   
    
  In August 2015, a purported stockholder of Charter, Matthew Sciabacucchi, filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, on behalf of a putative class of Charter stockholders, challenging the transactions between Charter, TWC, A/N, and Liberty Broadband announced by Charter on May 26, 2015 (collectively, the  Transactions ). The lawsuit names as defendants Liberty Broadband, Charter, the board of directors of Charter, and New Charter. Plaintiff alleged that the Transactions improperly benefit Liberty Broadband at the expense of other Charter shareholders, and that Charter issued a false and misleading proxy statement in connection with the Transactions.  Plaintiff requested, among other things, that the Delaware Court of Chancery enjoin the September 21, 2015 special meeting of Charter stockholders at which Charter stockholders were asked to vote on the Transactions until the defendants disclosed certain information relating to Charter and the Transactions. The disclosures demanded by the plaintiff included (i) certain unlevered free cash flow projections for Charter and (ii) a Form of Proxy and Right of First Refusal Agreement ( Proxy ) by and among Liberty Broadband, A/N, Charter and New Charter, which was referenced in the description of the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated May 23, 2015, among Charter, New Charter, Liberty Broadband and A/N. On September 9, 2015, Charter issued supplemental disclosures containing unlevered free cash flow projections for Charter. In return, the plaintiff agreed its disclosure claims were moot and withdrew its application to enjoin the Charter stockholder vote on the Transactions. Charter has filed a motion to dismiss this litigation but the court has not yet ruled upon it.  Charter denies any liability, believes that it has substantial defenses, and intends to vigorously defend this suit. 
    
  The California Attorney General and the Alameda County, California District Attorney are investigating whether certain of Legacy Charter s waste disposal policies, procedures and practices are in violation of the California Business and Professions Code and the California Health and Safety Code. That investigation was commenced in January 2014. A similar investigation involving Legacy TWC was initiated in February 2012.  Charter is cooperating with these investigations.  While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these investigations, it does not expect that the outcome will have a material effect on its operations, financial condition, or cash flows.  
    
  On December 19, 2011, Sprint Communications Company L.P. ( Sprint ) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas alleging that Legacy TWC infringes 12 patents purportedly relating to Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) services. The plaintiff is seeking monetary damages as well as injunctive relief. On October 8, 2015, the court stayed this litigation pending Sprint's appeal of a judgment in a parallel case against Cox Communications, Inc. ( Cox Communications ) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware invalidating six of the 12 patents at issue in the Legacy TWC litigation. The stay applied to all 12 patents at issue in Sprint s complaint against Legacy TWC.  On September 23, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the district court s order in the Cox Communications litigation invalidating the six patents.  On October 5, 2016, as a result of the Federal Circuit opinion, the Kansas court lifted the stay of the Legacy TWC case.  Charter intends to defend against this lawsuit vigorously, but is unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.

The Company is a defendant or co-defendant in several lawsuits involving alleged infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of its businesses. Other industry participants are also defendants in certain of these cases. In the event that a court ultimately determines that the Company infringes on any intellectual property rights, the Company may be subject to substantial damages and/or an injunction that could require the Company or its vendors to modify certain products and services the Company offers to its subscribers, as well as negotiate royalty or license agreements with respect to the patents at issue. While the Company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The Company cannot predict the outcome of any such claims nor can it reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. 
    
  The Company is party to lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of conducting its business, including lawsuits claiming violation of wage and hour laws and breach of contract by vendors, including by three programmers. The ultimate outcome of these other legal matters pending against the Company cannot be predicted, and although such lawsuits and claims are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such lawsuits could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Whether or not the Company ultimately prevails in any particular lawsuit or claim, litigation can be time consuming and costly and injure the Company s reputation. 

18.         Stock Compensation Plans 
    
  Legacy Charter s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (assumed by Charter upon closing of the Transactions) provides for grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance units and performance shares, share awards, phantom stock, restricted stock units and restricted stock.  Directors, officers and other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as others performing consulting services for the Company, are eligible for grants under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.  In April 2016, Charter s board of directors and stockholders approved an additional   9 million   shares of Charter Class A common stock (or units convertible into Charter Class A common stock) under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan. 
    
  At the closing of the TWC Transaction, Legacy TWC employee equity awards were converted into Charter Class A common stock equity awards on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Legacy TWC equity awards, except that the number of shares covered by each award and the option exercise prices were adjusted for the Stock Award Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement) such that the intrinsic value of the Converted TWC Awards was approximately equal to that of the original awards at the closing of the Transactions. The Converted TWC Awards represented approximately   4 million   Charter restricted stock units and   0.8 million   Charter stock options (  0.5 million   of which were exercisable at the time of conversion) and continue to be subject to the terms of the Legacy TWC equity plans.  The Converted TWC Awards were measured at their fair value as of the closing of the TWC Transaction. Of that fair value,   $514 million   related to Legacy TWC employee pre-combination service and was treated as consideration transferred in the TWC Transaction (See Note 2), while   $539 million   relates to post-combination service and will be amortized to stock compensation expense over the remaining vesting period of the awards.  The fair values of the Converted TWC Awards were based on a valuation using assumptions developed by management and other information compiled by management including, but not limited to, historical volatility and exercise trends of Legacy Charter and Legacy TWC.   
    
  The Parent Merger Exchange Ratio was also applied to outstanding Legacy Charter equity awards and option exercise prices; however, the terms of the equity awards did not change as a result of the Transactions.  Charter granted the following equity awards, excluding the Converted TWC Awards, for the periods presented after applying the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio, as applicable.

  (dollars in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated) 

Legacy Charter stock options granted prior to 2014 generally vest annually over   three   years from either the grant date or delayed vesting commencement dates.  Stock options generally expire   ten   years from the grant date.  Restricted stock generally vests annually   one   year from the date of grant.  Certain stock options and restricted stock units vest based on achievement of stock price hurdles.  Restricted stock units have no voting rights, and restricted stock units granted prior to 2014 vest ratably over   three   years from either the grant date or delayed vesting commencement dates.  Beginning in 2014, stock options and restricted stock units granted cliff vest upon the   three   year anniversary of each grant. Legacy TWC restricted stock units that were converted into Charter restricted stock units generally vest   50%   on each of the third and fourth anniversary of the grant date.  Legacy TWC stock options that were converted into Charter stock options vest ratably over a   four  -year period and expire   ten   years from the grant date. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation remaining to be recognized in future periods totaled   $296 million   for stock options,   $1 million   for restricted stock and   $364 million   for restricted stock units and the weighted average period over which they are expected to be recognized is   four   years for stock options,   one   year for restricted stock and   three   years for restricted stock units.    
    
  The Company recorded   $81 million   and   $168 million   of stock compensation expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, which is included in operating costs and expenses.  The Company also recorded   $57 million   and   $202 million   of expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, related to accelerated vesting of equity awards of terminated employees which is recorded in merger and restructuring costs.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded   $20 million   and   $58 million   of stock compensation expense, respectively, which is included in operating costs and expenses.  In connection with the TWC Transaction, Charter settled restricted stock units in the amount of   $59 million   for cash to be paid prior to the end of 2016 which amount is recorded in accounts payables and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016  . 

19.         Employee Benefit Plans 
    
  Upon completion of the TWC Transaction, Charter assumed sponsorship of Legacy TWC s pension plans.  The Company sponsors two qualified defined benefit pension plans, the TWC Pension Plan and the TWC Union Pension Plan, that provide pension benefits to a majority of Legacy TWC employees. The Company also provides a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees under the TWC Excess Pension Plan. 
    
  Pension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees  years of service and compensation during their employment period.  Actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions.  The Company has elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period. 
    
  Pension benefits are recorded as a net asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans and changes in the funded status are recorded in the year in which the changes occur.  As of the closing date of the TWC Transaction, the excess of the projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets was recognized as a liability and deferred actuarial losses and prior service credits previously recognized were eliminated in acquisition accounting. As of the closing date of the TWC Transaction, the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for the pension plans were   $4.0 billion   and   $2.9 billion  , respectively, and the net underfunded liability of the pension plans was recorded as a   $6 million   current pension liability and   $1.1 billion   long-term pension liability in acquisition accounting.  
    
  The rate of compensation increase used to measure the projected benefit obligation as of the closing of the TWC Transaction was an age-graded average increase of   4.25%  . The weighted average of discount rates used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the closing date of the TWC Transaction was   3.99%  .  The Company determined the discount rates based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments. The Company also utilized the RP 2015/MP 2015 mortality tables published by the Society of Actuaries to measure the projected benefit obligation as of the closing date of the TWC Transaction.  In addition, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine a component of net periodic benefit cost was   6.50%  .  In developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considered the pension portfolio s composition, past average rate of earnings and the Company s future asset allocation targets.

Pension Plan Assets 
    
  The assets of the qualified pension plans are held in a master trust in which the qualified pension plans are the only participating plans. The investment policy for the qualified pension plans is to achieve a reasonable long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to maintain adequate funding levels. The investment portfolio is a mix of fixed-income and equity securities with the objective of matching plan liability performance, diversifying risk and achieving a target investment return. The Company s allocation of plan assets includes fixed-income and equity securities of   39%   and   61%  , respectively, the substantial majority of which consist of Level 1 or Level 2 fair value measurements.   
    
  Net Periodic Pension Cost (Benefit) 
  The components of net periodic pension cost (benefit) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of the following: 

The service cost component of net periodic pension cost (benefit) is recorded in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The effects of the plan amendment made subsequent to the TWC Transaction, discussed below, resulted in a   $675 million   pension curtailment gain and   $157 million   remeasurement loss, net recorded in other operating expenses, net in the consolidated statements of operations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Pension Plan Curtailment Amendment  
  Following the closing of the TWC Transaction, Charter amended the pension plans to freeze future benefit accruals to current active plan participants as of August 31, 2016. Effective September 1, 2016, no future compensation increases or future service will be credited to participants of the pension plans and new hires will not be eligible to participate in the plans. Upon announcement and approval of the plan amendment, the assumptions underlying the pension liability and pension asset values were reassessed utilizing remeasurement date assumptions in accordance with Charter s mark-to-market pension accounting policy to record gains and losses in the period in which a remeasurement event occurs. The   $675 million   curtailment gain recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by the reduction of the compensation rate assumption to   zero   in accordance with the terms of the plan amendment, reflecting the pension liability at its accumulated benefit obligation instead of its projected benefit obligation at the remeasurement date. The   $157 million   remeasurement loss recorded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by the effects of a reduction of the discount rate from   3.99%   at the closing date of the TWC Transaction to   3.72%   at remeasurement date, net of a gain to record pension assets at June 30, 2016 fair values.  As of the remeasurement date, June 30, 2016, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans was   $3.6 billion   and   $2.9 billion  , respectively, for a net underfunded liability of   $647 million  . 
    
  Pension Plan Contributions 
  The Company made no cash contributions to the qualified pension plans during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ; however, the Company may make discretionary cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in the future. Such contributions will be dependent on a variety of factors, including current and expected interest rates, asset performance, the funded status of the qualified pension plans and management s judgment. For the nonqualified unfunded pension plan, the Company will continue to make contributions during the remainder of 2016 to the extent benefits are paid.

Defined Contribution Benefit Plans 
  Upon completion of the TWC Transaction, Charter assumed Legacy TWC s defined contribution plan, the TWC Savings Plan. In June 2016, the Company announced changes to both the Charter Communications, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the  401(k) Plan ) and the TWC Savings Plan that were effective September 1, 2016.  The Company s matching contribution to the 401(k) Plan and the TWC Savings Plan equal   100%   of the amount of the salary reduction the participant elects to defer up to   6%   of the participant s eligible pay.  For employees who are not eligible to participate in the Company s long-term incentive plan and who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the Company also provides a contribution to a new Retirement Accumulation Plan, equal to   3%   of eligible pay.   

20.         Consolidating Schedules  
    
  Each of Charter Operating, TWC, LLC, TWCE, CCO Holdings and certain subsidiaries jointly, severally, fully and unconditionally guarantee the outstanding debt securities of the others (other than the CCO Holdings notes) on an unsecured senior basis and the condensed consolidating financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10,   Financial Statements of Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities Registered or Being Registered.

CCOH Safari, CCO Safari II and CCO Safari III issued the CCOH Safari notes, CCO Safari II notes and the CCO Safari III credit facilities, respectively.  Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, the CCOH Safari notes became obligations of CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital and the CCO Safari II notes and CCO Safari III credit facilities became obligations of Charter Operating and Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp. CCOH Safari merged into CCO Holdings and CCO Safari II and CCO Safari III merged into Charter Operating.

21.         Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), which is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.  The new standard provides a single principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers, which steps are to (1) identify the contract(s) with the customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. More specifically, revenue will be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 will be effective, reflecting the one-year deferral, for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (January 1, 2018 for the Company).  Early adoption of the standard is permitted but not before the original effective date. Companies can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and the selected method of transition to the new standard. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,   Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   ( ASU 2015-05 ), which provides guidance in determining whether fees for purchasing cloud computing services (or hosted software solutions) are considered internal-use software or should be considered a service contract.  The cloud computing agreement that includes a software license should be accounted for in the same manner as internal-use software if customer has contractual right to take possession of the software during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible to either run the software on customer s hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software. Arrangements that don t meet the requirements for internal-use software should be accounted for as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 (January 1, 2016 for the Company).  The adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.  Lessees are allowed to account for short-term leases (i.e., leases with a term of 12 months or less) off-balance sheet, consistent with current operating lease accounting.  For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines.  ASU 2016-02 will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (January 1, 2019 for the Company).  Early adoption is permitted.  The new standard requires a modified retrospective transition through a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ), which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. The new standard (1) requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the period in which they occur regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period, (2) requires classification of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statements of cash flows, (3) allows an entity to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur and (4) causes the threshold under which employee share-based awards partially settled in cash can qualify for equity classification to increase to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for interim and annual periods after December 15, 2016 (January 1, 2017 for the Company). Early adoption of the standard is permitted but requires adoption of all provisions included in the amendment in the same period. The new standard generally requires a modified retrospective transition through a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the period of adoption, with certain provisions requiring either a prospective or retrospective transition. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which clarifies how entities should classify cash receipts and cash payments related to eight specific cash flow matters on the statement of cash flows, with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice.  ASU 2016-15 will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (January 1, 2018 for the Company).  Early adoption is permitted.  The

Item 2.           Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    
    
  General 
    
  Charter Communications, Inc. (together with its controlled subsidiaries,  Charter ) is the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications company providing video, Internet and voice services with approximately   25.9 million   residential and commercial customers at   September 30, 2016  .  We also sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and networking and enterprise-class, cloud-enabled hosting, managed applications and transport services to business customers and own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and lifestyle channels.  Our residential services also include security and home management services.   
    
  Charter is a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Charter Communications Holdings, LLC ( Charter Holdings ), an indirect owner of Charter Communications Operating, LLC ( Charter Operating ) under which all of the operations reside. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions among consolidated entities have been eliminated. 
    
  TWC Transaction 
    
  On May 18, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Mergers dated as of May 23, 2015 (the  Merger Agreement ), by and among Time Warner Cable Inc. ( Legacy TWC ), Charter Communications, Inc. prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement ( Legacy Charter ), CCH I, LLC, previously a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Charter ( New Charter ) and certain other subsidiaries of New Charter were completed (the  TWC Transaction,  and together with the Bright House Transaction described below, the  Transactions ).  As a result of the TWC Transaction, New Charter became the new public parent company that holds the operations of the combined companies and was renamed Charter Communications, Inc.  
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the TWC Transaction, each outstanding share of Legacy TWC common stock (other than Legacy TWC common stock held by Liberty Broadband Corporation ( Liberty Broadband ) and Liberty Interactive Corporation ( Liberty Interactive  and, collectively, the  Liberty Parties )), was converted into the right to receive, at the option of each such holder of Legacy TWC common stock, either (a)   $100   in cash and Charter Class A common stock equivalent to   0.5409   shares of Legacy Charter Class A common stock (the  Option A Consideration ) or (b)   $115   in cash and Charter Class A common stock equivalent to   0.4562   shares of Legacy Charter Class A common stock (the  Option B Consideration ). The actual number of shares of Charter Class A common stock that Legacy TWC stockholders received, excluding the Liberty Parties, was calculated by multiplying the exchange ratios of   0.5409   or   0.4562   specified above by   0.9042   (the  Parent Merger Exchange Ratio ), which was also the exchange ratio that was used to determine the number of shares of Charter Class A common stock that Legacy Charter stockholders received per share of Legacy Charter Class A common stock.  Such exchange ratio did not impact the aggregate value represented by the shares of Charter Class A common stock issued in the TWC Transaction; however, it did impact the actual number of shares issued in the TWC Transaction. 
    
  Out of approximately   277 million   shares of TWC common stock outstanding at the closing of the TWC Transaction, excluding TWC common stock held by the Liberty Parties, approximately   274 million   shares were converted into the right to receive the Option A Consideration and approximately   3 million   shares were converted into the right to receive the Option B Consideration.  The Liberty Parties received approximately   one   share of Charter Class A common stock for each share of Legacy TWC common stock they owned (equivalent to   1.106   shares of Legacy Charter Class A common stock multiplied by the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio).   
    
  As of the date of the Transactions, the total value of the TWC Transaction was approximately   $85 billion  , including cash, equity and Legacy TWC assumed debt.  The purchase price also includes an estimated pre-combination vesting period fair value of   $514 million   for Legacy TWC equity awards converted into Charter awards upon closing of the TWC Transaction ( Converted TWC Awards ) and   $69 million   of cash paid to former Legacy TWC employees and non-employee directors who held equity awards, whether vested or not vested.  
    
  Bright House Transaction 
    
  Also, on May 18, 2016, Legacy Charter and Advance/Newhouse Partnership ( A/N ), the former parent of Bright House Networks, LLC ( Bright House ), completed their previously announced transaction, pursuant to a definitive Contribution Agreement (the  Contribution Agreement ), under which Charter acquired Bright House (the  Bright House Transaction ).  Pursuant to the Bright House Transaction, Charter became the owner of the membership interests in Bright House and the other assets primarily related to Bright House (other than certain excluded assets and liabilities and non-operating cash).  As of the date of acquisition, the purchase price totaled approximately   $12.2 billion   consisting of (a)   $2 billion   in cash, (b)   25 million   convertible preferred units  

43 

of Charter Holdings with a face amount of   $2.5 billion   that pay a   6%   annual preferential dividend, (c) approximately   31.0 million   common units of Charter Holdings that are exchangeable into Charter Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis and (d)   one   share of Charter Class B common stock. 
    
  Liberty Transaction  
    
  In connection with the TWC Transaction, Legacy Charter and Liberty Broadband completed their previously announced transactions pursuant to their investment agreement, in which Liberty Broadband purchased for cash approximately   22.0 million   shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at   $4.3 billion   at the closing of the TWC Transaction to partially finance the cash portion of the TWC Transaction consideration. In connection with the Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband purchased approximately   3.7 million   shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at   $700 million   at the closing of the Bright House Transaction. 
    
  Financing for the Transactions 
    
  Charter partially financed the cash portion of the purchase price of the Transactions with additional indebtedness and cash on hand.  In 2015, Charter issued $15.5 billion aggregate principal amount of CCO Safari II, LLC ( CCO Safari II ) senior secured notes,   $3.8 billion   aggregate principal amount of CCO Safari III, LLC ( CCO Safari III ) senior secured bank loans and   $2.5 billion   aggregate principal amount of CCOH Safari, LLC ( CCOH Safari ) senior unsecured notes.  The net proceeds were initially deposited into an escrow account.  Upon closing of the TWC Transaction and release of the proceeds, the CCOH Safari notes became obligations of CCO Holdings, LLC ( CCO Holdings ), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Charter Holdings, and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. ( CCO Holdings Capital ), and the CCO Safari II notes and CCO Safari III credit facilities became obligations of Charter Operating and Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp. CCOH Safari merged into CCO Holdings and CCO Safari II and CCO Safari III merged into Charter Operating.  In connection with the closing of the Bright House Transaction, Charter Operating closed on a   $2.6 billion   aggregate principal amount term loan A facility. 
    
  Transaction-Related Commitments 
    
  The Federal Communications Commission (the  FCC ) order approving the Transactions contained certain conditions including build out of an additional two million locations with access to a high-speed connection within five years.  At least one million of those connections must be in competition with another high-speed broadband provider in the market served.  The FCC order also provides that Charter will not be permitted to charge usage-based prices or impose data caps and will be prohibited from charging interconnection fees for seven years, although the FCC sets forth a process in which the FCC could eliminate the conditions after five years.  
    
  Under the terms of the order with the Department of Justice ( DOJ ), Charter is prohibited from entering into or enforcing any agreement with a programmer that forbids, limits or creates incentives to limit the programmer s provision of content to one or more on-line video distributors ( OVDs ). The settlement further provides that Charter will not be able to avail itself of other distributors  most favored nation ( MFN ) provisions if they are inconsistent with this prohibition. The settlement also prohibits Charter from retaliating against programmers for licensing to OVDs. These DOJ conditions are in force for seven years, although Charter may petition the DOJ to eliminate the conditions after five years.

  Overview 
    
  Since 2012, Legacy Charter has actively invested in its network and operations and improved the quality and value of the products and packages that Legacy Charter offered.  Through the roll-out of Spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products, delivering more value to new and existing customers.   Further, through  the transition of our Legacy Charter markets to our all-digital platform, we increased our offerings to more than 200 HD channels in most of the Legacy Charter markets and offered Internet speeds of at least 60Mbps, among other benefits.  We believe that this product set combined with improved customer service, as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations, has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes.   
    
  As a result of the Transactions, quarterly revenues increased by over $7 billion year over year.  We also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale.  In September 2016, we began launching Spectrum pricing and packaging to Legacy TWC markets and we expect that by mid 2017, we will offer Spectrum pricing and packaging in all Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. In 2017, we intend to begin converting the remaining Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House analog markets to an all-digital platform and we expect to complete this initiative by the end of 2018.  By the end of 2016, we expect that most of our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, will be centralized.  Field operations will be managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the Transactions.  Over a multi-year period, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer care centers will migrate to Charter s model of using virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers.  We will focus on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. We expect customer and financial results to trend similar to Legacy Charter following the implementation of the Legacy Charter operating strategies across the  

46 

Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. As a result of implementing our operating strategy at Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates. 
    
  Our most significant competitors are direct broadcast satellite providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and functions similar to our Internet, video and voice services, including in some cases wireless services.  These services are frequently offered in bundles similar to ours. In addition, some consumers have chosen to receive video over the Internet rather than through pay television services including from us.   
    
  The Company realized revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations during the periods presented on an actual basis and pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, as follows (in millions).  

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, net, other expense, net and other operating expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and gain (loss) on sale or retirement of assets.  See   Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow  for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.  Growth in total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations was primarily due to the Transactions.     
  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our Internet and commercial businesses.  On a pro forma basis, Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs.   In addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization, merger and restructuring costs and stock compensation expense.    
    
  We incurred the following costs in connection with the Transactions (in millions). 

Amounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies  systems and processes into a uniform operating structure.  Costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration.  Other operating expenses associated with the Transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs.  Interest expense associated with the Transactions represents interest incurred on the CCO Safari II, CCO Safari III and CCOH Safari notes issued in advance of the closing of the Transactions, the proceeds of which were held in escrow to finance the Transactions. 

47 

We have a history of net losses.  Our net losses were principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur on our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made, and continue to make, in our cable properties, amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and higher non-cash income tax expense.  We will incur significant increases in interest expense and depreciation and amortization as a result of the Transactions and will incur restructuring and transition costs for at least one to two years, and as a result, absent non-recurring impacts such as the reversal of the income tax valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016, we may incur net losses in the future. 
     
  All customer statistics as of   September 30, 2016   include operations of Legacy TWC, Legacy Bright House and Legacy Charter each of which is based on the legacy company s reporting methodology.  Such methodologies differ and these differences may be material.  Once statistical reporting is fully integrated, all prior periods will be recast to reflect a consistent methodology.  The following table summarizes our customer statistics for video, Internet and voice as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands except per customer data and footnotes).   

After giving effect to the Transactions, September 30, 2015 residential and small and medium business customer relationships would have been 23,436,000 and 1,221,000, respectively, residential video, Internet and voice PSUs would have been 16,944,000, 19,416,000 and 9,655,000, respectively and small and medium business PSUs would have been 354,000, 1,045,000 and 643,000, respectively; Enterprise PSUs would have been 77,000. 

48 

(b) 
    Customer relationships include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing video, Internet and voice services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive.  Customers who reside in residential multiple dwelling units ( MDUs ) and that are billed under bulk contracts are counted based on the number of billed units within each bulk MDU.  Total customer relationships excludes enterprise customer relationships. 
       
           (c) 
    Monthly residential revenue per residential customer is calculated as total residential video, Internet and voice quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average residential customer relationships during the respective quarter. 
       
           (d) 
    Monthly small and medium business revenue per customer is calculated as total small and medium business quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average small and medium business customer relationships during the respective quarter. 
       
           (e) 
    Enterprise PSUs represent the aggregate number of fiber service offerings counting each separate service offering as an individual PSU. 
       
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    
    
  For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and the means by which we develop estimates therefore, see  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K and "Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.  There have been no material changes from the critical accounting policies described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. 

Results of Operations    
    
  We completed the Transactions on May 18, 2016 and have included the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operating results since that date.  In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), operating results from Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House prior to the closing of the Transactions have been excluded.  For purposes of management s discussion and analysis, we have given explanations of increases and decreases in our results of operations on an actual basis, as well as on a pro forma basis assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015.  Due to the size of the Transactions, we believe that providing a discussion of our results of operations on a pro forma basis provides management and investors a more meaningful perspective on our financial and operational performance and trends.  The results of operations data on a pro forma basis are provided for illustrative purposes only and are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable and do not purport to represent what our actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position.  
    
  See Exhibit 99.1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 for pro forma financial information for each quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarter of 2016.  

49 

The following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share data):  

Revenues.      Total revenues grew   $7.6 billion   or   310%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , and grew   $11.5 billion   or   159%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Revenue growth primarily reflects the Transactions and increases in the number of residential Internet and triple play customers and in commercial business customers, growth in rates driven by higher equipment revenue and rate increases offset by a decrease in basic video customers.  The Transactions increased revenues for   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three and nine   months   September 30, 2015   by approximately $7.4 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was   7%   for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  .

On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, small and medium business PSUs increased by 282,000 from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   and the increase in small and medium business commercial revenues is attributable to the following (dollars in millions): 

Excluding the impacts of the Transactions, enterprise PSUs increased 7,000 from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, enterprise PSUs increased by 16,000 from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .

On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, enterprise commercial revenues increased   $47 million   and   $161 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily due to growth in customers. 
    
  Advertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers, programmers and other vendors, as well as local cable and advertising on regional sports and news channels.  Advertising sales revenues increased   $342 million   and   $506 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily due to the Transactions.  The Transactions increased advertising sales revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding periods in 2015 by $336 million and $495 million, respectively.  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, advertising sales revenues increased   $45 million   and   $84 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily due to an increase in political advertising.  
    
  Other revenues consist of revenue from regional sports and news channels (excluding intercompany charges or advertising sales on those channels), home shopping, late payment fees, wire maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues.  Other revenues increased   $167 million   and   $251 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily as a result of the Transactions.  The Transactions increased other revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   by $173 million and $257 million, respectively.  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, other revenues decreased   $2 million    

54 

and increased by   $38 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  .  The increase during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 2015 is primarily due to a settlement related to an early contract termination and an increase in processing fees.   
    
  Operating costs and expenses  .    The increases in our operating costs and expenses, exclusive of items shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations, are attributable to the following (dollars in millions): 

Programming costs were approximately   $2.4 billion   and   $667 million  , representing   37%   and   41%   of total operating costs and expenses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $4.6 billion   and   $2.0 billion  , representing   38%   and   42%   of total operating costs and expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increases in operating costs and expenses for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding prior periods were primarily due to the Transactions which increased operating costs and expenses by approximately $4.7 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. 
    
  The increase in other expense is attributable to the following (dollars in millions): 

The increases in other expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding prior periods were primarily due to the Transactions which increased other expense by approximately $850 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. 

55 

On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, increases in our operating costs and expenses, exclusive of items shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations, are attributable to the following (dollars in millions): 

On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, programming costs were approximately   $2.4 billion   and   $2.2 billion  , representing   37%   and   36%   of total operating costs and expenses for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $7.2 billion   and   $6.7 billion  , representing   37%   and   36%   of total operating costs and expenses for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, digital, premium, video on demand, and pay-per-view programming. The increase in pro forma programming costs is primarily a result of annual contractual rate adjustments, including increases in amounts paid for retransmission consents and the introduction of new networks offset by synergies as a result of the Transactions and lower pay-per-view programming expenses.  We expect pro forma programming expenses will continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new sports services. We have been unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a potential loss of customers. 
    
  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the increase in other expense is attributable to the following (dollars in millions): 

The increases in corporate costs relate primarily to increases in the number of employees. Stock compensation expense increased primarily due to increases in headcount and the value of equity issued. 

56 

Depreciation and amortization.      Depreciation and amortization expense increased by   $1.9 billion   and   $2.8 billion   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily as a result of additional depreciation and amortization related to the Transactions, inclusive of the incremental amounts as a result of the higher fair values recorded in acquisition accounting.     
    
  Other operating expenses, net.    The changes in other operating expenses, net are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):   

The increase in merger and restructuring costs is primarily due to approximately $171 million and $451 million of employee retention and employee termination costs incurred during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.      The nine months ended September 30, 2016 also includes approximately $262 million of Legacy Charter and Legacy TWC contingent financing and advisory transaction fees paid at the closing of the Transactions.  The increase in other pension benefits during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding prior period is primarily due to the pension curtailment gain of $675 million, net of the remeasurement loss of $157 million. For more information, see Notes 13 and 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in  Item 1. Financial Statements.  
    
  Interest expense, net.      Net interest expense increased by   $371 million   and   $900 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily as a result of an increase of approximately $77 million and $469 million, respectively, of interest expense associated with the debt incurred to fund the Transactions, and $243 million and $359 million, respectively, associated with debt assumed from Legacy TWC.  
    
  Loss on extinguishment of debt.    Loss on extinguishment of debt of $110 million and $128 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, primarily represent losses recognized as a result of the repurchase of CCO Holdings notes. For more information, see Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in  Item 1. Financial Statements.  
    
  Gain (loss) on financial instruments, net.    Interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage our interest costs and to reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates, and cross-currency derivative instruments are used to manage foreign exchange risk related to the foreign currency denominated debt assumed in the TWC Transaction.  We recorded gains of   $71 million   and   $16 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and losses of   $5 million   and   $10 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  Gains and losses on financial instruments are recognized due to changes in the fair value of our interest rate and cross currency derivative instruments and the remeasurement of the fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated notes (the  Sterling Notes ) into U.S. dollars. The nine months ended September 30, 2016,  also includes an $11 million loss realized upon termination of Legacy TWC interest rate swap derivative instruments.  For more information, see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in  Item 1. Financial Statements.  
    
  Other expense, net.    Other expense, net  primarily represents equity losses on our equity-method investments.  For more information, see Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in  Item 1. Financial Statements.  
    
  Income tax benefit (expense).     We recognized income tax expense of   $16 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and an income tax benefit of   $3.1 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and income tax expense of   $142 million   and   $72 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Certain of the deferred tax liabilities that were assumed in connection with the closing of the TWC Transaction will reverse and provide a source of future taxable income, resulting in a reduction of approximately $3.3 billion of Legacy Charter s preexisting valuation allowance associated with its  

57 

deferred tax assets.  Such release of Legacy Charter s valuation allowance was recognized directly to income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Income tax expense and benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, were impacted by a change in a state tax law that resulted in approximately $44 million of tax benefit. The tax provision in future periods will vary based on current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results.  For more information, see Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in  Item 1. Financial Statements.  
    
  Income tax expense in   2015   was recognized primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities related to Legacy Charter s franchises, which are characterized as indefinite lived for book financial reporting purposes, as well as, to a lesser extent, through current federal and state income tax expense.  Current federal and state income tax expense included $22 million and zero for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $35 million and $4 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.    Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes represents A/N s portion of Charter Holdings  net income based on its effective common unit ownership interest of approximately 10% and on the preferred dividend of   $37 million   and   $55 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.   For more information, see Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in  Item 1. Financial Statements.  
    
  Net income (loss) attributable to Charter shareholders.     Net income attributable to Charter shareholders increased from   $54 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $189 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and increased from a net loss of   $149 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to net income of   $3.1 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of the factors described above.  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, net income attributable to Charter shareholders increased from   $2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $189 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and increased from   $29 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $616 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Use of Adjusted EBITDA     and Free Cash Flow 
    
  We use certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) to evaluate various aspects of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, other expense, net and other operating expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.     
    
  Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures. 
    
  Management and Charter s board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to assess our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. Our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which were   $231 million   and   $79 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $535 million   and   $231 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
    
  Introduction    
    
  This section contains a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including a discussion of our cash position, sources and uses of cash, access to credit facilities and other financing sources, historical financing activities, cash needs, capital expenditures and outstanding debt.  
    
  Overview of Our Contractual Obligations and Liquidity  
    
  We have significant amounts of debt. The principal amount of our debt as of   September 30, 2016   was   $60.2 billion  , consisting of   $9.0 billion   of credit facility debt,   $37.8 billion   of investment grade senior secured notes and   $13.4 billion   of high-yield senior unsecured notes. Our business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $49 million   of our long-term debt matures in   2016  ,   $2.2 billion   in   2017  ,   $2.2 billion   in   2018  ,   $3.5 billion   in   2019  ,   $5.2 billion   in   2020   and   $47.0 billion   thereafter.  

59 

Our projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. Free cash flow was   $1.0 billion   and   $208 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $1.5 billion   and   $467 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately   $2.8 billion   and cash on hand was approximately   $1.2 billion  .  We expect to utilize free cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of or reduce the principal on our obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions.  Additionally, we may, from time to time, and depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers or redemption provisions. We believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and Charter Operating s revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected cash needs. 
    
  We continue to evaluate the deployment of our anticipated future free cash flow including to invest in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions as well as stock repurchases and dividends and to reduce our leverage. Our target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5 times, and 3.5 times at the Charter Operating level. On October 25, 2016, Charter s board of directors authorized management to engage in opportunistic share repurchases of up to $750 million in any six-month period with the first period commencing the day of any repurchase after Charter s third quarter 2016 earnings release and provided that Charter s net debt remains within its then current target leverage range. Charter is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the timing of any purchases that may occur cannot be predicted and will largely depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital. Purchases may include open market purchases or negotiated transactions. As possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise in our industry, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, clustering or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results. 
    
  Free Cash Flow 
    
  Free cash flow increased   $793 million   and   $997 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding prior periods in   2015  , respectively, due to the following (dollars in millions). 

60 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table summarizes our payment obligations as of   September 30, 2016   under our long-term debt and certain other contractual obligations and commitments (dollars in millions).   

(a) 
    The table presents maturities of long-term debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .  Refer to Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in  Item 1. Financial Statements  for a description of our long-term debt. 
              (b) 
    Interest payments on variable debt are estimated using amounts outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and the average implied forward London Interbank Offering Rate ( LIBOR ) rates applicable for the quarter during the interest rate reset based on the yield curve in effect at   September 30, 2016  .  Actual interest payments will differ based on actual LIBOR rates and actual amounts outstanding for applicable periods. 
               (d) 
    We pay programming fees under multi-year contracts ranging from three to ten years, typically based on a flat fee per customer, which may be fixed for the term, or may in some cases escalate over the term.  Programming costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were approximately   $2.4 billion   and   $667 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $4.6 billion   and   $2.0 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Certain of our programming agreements are based on a flat fee per month or have guaranteed minimum payments.  The table sets forth the aggregate guaranteed minimum commitments under our programming contracts. 
              (e) 
     Other  represents other guaranteed minimum commitments, including programming rights negotiated directly with content owners for distribution on Company-owned channels or networks and commitments related to our role as an advertising and distribution sales agent for third party-owned channels or networks as well as commitments to our customer premise equipment vendors. 
       
  Charter has agreed to certain commitments that were effective upon the consummation of the Transactions. See  Transaction-Related Commitments  for more information. Additionally, see Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in  Item 1. Financial Statements  for items not included in the contractual obligations table, but we incur as part of operations. 
    
  Limitations on Distributions 
    
  Distributions by our subsidiaries to a parent company for payment of principal on parent company notes are restricted under indentures and credit facilities governing our indebtedness, unless there is no default under the applicable indenture and credit facilities, and unless each applicable subsidiary s leverage ratio test is met at the time of such distribution.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was no default under any of these indentures or credit facilities, and each subsidiary met its applicable leverage ratio tests based on   September 30, 2016   financial results.  Such distributions would be restricted, however, if any such subsidiary fails to meet these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. In the past, certain subsidiaries have from time to time failed to meet their leverage ratio test.  There can be no assurance that they will satisfy these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. Distributions by Charter Operating for payment of principal on parent company notes are further restricted by the covenants in its credit facilities.   

61 

However, without regard to leverage, during any calendar year or any portion thereof during which the borrower is a flow-through entity for tax purposes, and so long as no event of default exists, the borrower may make distributions to the equity interests of the borrower in an amount sufficient to make permitted tax payments. 
    
  In addition to the limitation on distributions under the various indentures discussed above, distributions by our subsidiaries may be limited by applicable law, including the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, under which our subsidiaries may only make distributions if they have  surplus  as defined in the act.    
    
  Historical Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities    
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents.    We held   $1.2 billion   and   $5 million   in cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  We also held   $22.3 billion   in restricted cash and cash equivalents as of   December 31, 2015   representing proceeds of debt raised to fund the cash portion of the TWC Transaction consideration that were held in escrow until consummation of the TWC Transaction. 
    
  Operating Activities.      Net cash provided by operating activities increased   $3.1 billion   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of   $4.2 billion   offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, net of $1.2 billion.  
    
  Investing Activities.      Net cash used in investing activities was   $9.9 billion   and   $13.9 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 primarily represented the acquisitions of TWC and Bright House.  Cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015 primarily represented the investment in 2015 of net proceeds from the issuance of the CCO Safari II notes and CCO Safari III credit facilities in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents offset by the repayment of $7.1 billion of net proceeds held in escrow upon the termination of the proposed transactions with Comcast.  The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   is offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $2.1 billion. 
    
  Financing Activities.      Net cash provided by financing activities was   $6.3 billion   and   $12.1 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in cash provided was primarily due to the issuance in 2015 of the CCO Safari II notes and CCO Safari III credit facilities offset by the repayment in 2015 of $7.1 billion of net proceeds held in escrow upon the termination of the proposed transactions with Comcast as compared to the issuance of $5 billion of equity to Liberty Broadband to fund a portion of the Transactions in 2016.  
    
  Capital Expenditures    
    
  We have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.  Capital expenditures were   $1.7 billion   and   $509 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $3.4 billion   and   $1.3 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase was driven by the Transactions.  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the increase for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding prior period was driven by higher product development investments, transition capital expenditures incurred in connection with the Transactions and support capital investments.  See the table below for more details. 
     
  The actual amount of our capital expenditures in 2016 will depend on a number of factors, including the pace of transition planning to service a larger customer base as a result of the Transactions and growth rates of both our residential and commercial businesses. 
    
  Our capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility.  In addition, our accrued liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by   $86 million   and   $11 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

62 

The following tables present our major capital expenditures categories on an actual and pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, in accordance with National Cable and Telecommunications Association ( NCTA ) disclosure guidelines for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The disclosure is intended to provide more consistency in the reporting of capital expenditures among peer companies in the cable industry.  These disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under GAAP, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under GAAP (dollars in millions): 

(a) 
    Customer premise equipment includes costs incurred at the customer residence to secure new customers and revenue generating units.  It also includes customer installation costs and customer premise equipment (e.g., set-top boxes and cable modems). 
              (b) 
    Scalable infrastructure includes costs not related to customer premise equipment, to secure growth of new customers and revenue generating units, or provide service enhancements (e.g., headend equipment). 
              (c) 
    Line extensions include network costs associated with entering new service areas (e.g., fiber/coaxial cable, amplifiers, electronic equipment, make-ready and design engineering). 
              (d) 
    Upgrade/rebuild includes costs to modify or replace existing fiber/coaxial cable networks, including betterments. 
              (e) 
    Support capital includes costs associated with the replacement or enhancement of non-network assets due to technological and physical obsolescence (e.g., non-network equipment, land, buildings and vehicles).  
              (f) 
    Transition represents incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure. 
       
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  See Note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in  Item 1. Financial Statements  for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards. 

63 

Item 3.           Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    
    
  We use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk on variable debt and foreign exchange risk on the Sterling Notes, and do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
    
  Interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage interest costs and to reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates.  We manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable-rate debt.  Using interest rate derivative instruments, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals through 2017, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed-upon notional principal amounts.  
    
  Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, we assumed cross-currency derivative instruments.  Cross-currency derivative instruments are used to effectively convert    1.275 billion   aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate U.S. dollar denominated debt. The cross-currency derivative instruments have maturities of June 2031 and July 2042. We are required to post collateral on the cross-currency derivative instruments when such instruments are in a liability position. In May 2016, we entered into a collateral holiday agreement for   80%   of both the 2031 and 2042 cross-currency swaps, which eliminates the requirement to post collateral for   three   years.  For more information, see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in  Item 1. Financial Statements.  
         
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the principal amount of our debt was approximately   $60.2 billion   and   $35.9 billion  , respectively.  As of   December 31, 2015  , this included $21.8 billion of debt which proceeds were held in escrow pending consummation of the TWC Transaction.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility debt, including the effects of our interest rate swap agreements, was approximately 3.2% and 3.3%, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate on the senior notes was approximately 5.9% and 5.5%, respectively, resulting in a blended weighted average interest rate of 5.5% and 5.1%, respectively.  The interest rate on approximately   87%   and   83%   of the total principal amount of our debt was effectively fixed, including the effects of our interest rate swap agreements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
     
  The table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions). 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.1 billion   in notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments outstanding.  The notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of our exposure to credit loss.  The amounts exchanged are determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the contracts.   
    
  The estimated fair value of the interest rate derivative instruments is determined using a present value calculation based on an implied forward LIBOR curve (adjusted for Charter Operating s and counterparties  credit risk).  Interest rates on variable-rate debt are estimated using the average implied forward LIBOR for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at   September 30, 2016   including applicable bank spread.

Item 4.           Controls and Procedures. 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures with respect to the information generated for use in this quarterly report.  The evaluation was based upon reports and certifications provided by a number of executives.  Based on, and as of the date of that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  
    
  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon the evaluation, we believe that our controls provide such reasonable assurances. 
    
  On May 18, 2016, we completed the Transactions and as a result, we have incorporated internal controls over significant processes specific to the Transactions and to activities post Transactions that we believe to be appropriate and necessary in consideration of the related integration, including controls associated with the Transactions for the valuations of certain Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House assets and liabilities assumed, as well as adoption of common financial reporting and internal control practices for the combined company.  As we further integrate Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, we will continue to validate the effectiveness and integration of internal controls. 
    
  Except as described above in the preceding paragraph, during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  (C)      Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer 
    
  The following table presents Charter s purchases of equity securities completed during the   third   quarter of   2016   (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):  

(2)   
    In July 2016, Charter s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of Charter s Class A common stock.  Under this authorization, shares of Charter s Class A common stock may be purchased from time to time during the course of any six-month period.  As of September 30, 2016, approximately   1.1 million   shares of Charter s Class A common stock were repurchased under the program for a total of approximately   $281 million  . 

Item 5.           Other Information. 
    
  On November 2, 2016, Charter entered into new employment agreements with its President and Chief Operating Officer, John Bickham; Chief Financial Officer, Christopher L. Winfrey; and Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Jonathan Hargis.  The new employment agreements supersede the prior employment agreements between each of the foregoing executive officers and Charter. 
    
  Each of the employment agreements has an initial term of five years, which is subject to renewal thereafter for one-year periods at Charter s discretion.  In consideration for the services of Messrs. Bickham, Winfrey and Hargis, the employment agreements provide for an annual base salary of $1,500,000, $850,000 and $600,000, respectively, a target annual bonus opportunity of 200%, 150% and 110%, respectively, of annual base salary and participation in employee benefit plans generally on the same terms as our other senior executives.  In addition, Mr. Bickham may use Charter s jet aircraft for personal purposes for up to 80 hours per calendar year, and each of Messrs. Bickham, Winfrey and Hargis are entitled to reimbursement of legal fees incurred in connection with the negotiation of the employment agreements of up to $50,000, $20,000 and $10,000, respectively. 
    
  If the employment of Messrs. Bickham, Winfrey or Hargis were terminated involuntarily by Charter without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, the executive officer would be entitled to (a) a cash severance payment equal to the product of 2.5 (in the case of Mr. Bickham) or 2.0 (in the case of Messrs. Winfrey and Hargis) multiplied by the sum of his annual base salary and target annual bonus opportunity for the year in which the termination occurs, (b) a cash payment equal to the cost of COBRA coverage for 30 months (in the case of Mr. Bickham) or 24 months (in the case of Messrs. Winfrey and Hargis) following termination  

66 

and (c) up to 12 months of executive-level outplacement services.  In addition, upon a termination of employment under such circumstances or due to death or disability, Mr. Bickham would be entitled to a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination (determined based on actual performance) and a cash payment for the intrinsic value of his performance equity awards granted in June and July 2016 as to which the applicable stock price target is met upon termination, which payment would be prorated based on the portion of the applicable three, four or five year vesting period elapsed as of the date of termination. 
    
  The foregoing severance benefits generally are subject to the applicable executive officer s execution of a release of claims in favor of Charter and its affiliates.  In addition, Messrs. Bickham, Winfrey and Hargis have each agreed to comply with noncompetition and customer nonsolicitation covenants for one year following termination (in the case of Mr. Bickham) or two years following termination (in the case of Messrs. Winfrey and Hargis), a nonsolicitation of employees covenant for two years following termination (in the case of Mr. Bickham) or one year following termination (in the case of Messrs. Winfrey and Hargis), a perpetual confidentiality covenant and a perpetual nondisparagement covenant. 
    
  Following the conclusion of the initial term of the employment agreements in 2021, each of Messrs. Bickham and Hargis would be entitled to a prorated annual bonus for such year (determined based on actual performance) if their employment terminates in such year for any reason.  If Mr. Winfrey s employment terminates for any reason following a notice of non-renewal of his employment agreement, he would be entitled to a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination (determined based on actual performance). 
    
  The foregoing summary of the employment agreements with Messrs. Bickham, Winfrey and Hargis does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each employment agreement, which are included as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, hereto.

  WHEREAS, Executive s agreement to the terms and conditions of Sections 13, 14 and 15 are a material and essential condition of Executive s employment with the Company under the terms of this Agreement. 
    
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the respective covenants and agreements set forth below, the Parties agree as follows:

  (i)    Executive s willful breach of a material obligation (which, if curable, is not cured within ten (10) business days after the Company provides written notice of such breach) or representation under this Agreement, Executive s willful breach of any fiduciary duty to the Company, which, if curable, is not cured within ten (10) business days after the Company provides written notice of such breach; or any act of fraud or willful and material misrepresentation or concealment upon, to or from the Company or the Board; 
    
  (ii)  Executive s willful failure to comply in any material respect with (A) the Company s Code of Conduct in effect from time to time and applicable to officers and/or employees generally, or (B) any written Company policy, if such policy is material to the effective performance by Executive of  

Executive s duties under this Agreement, and, if such failure is curable, if Executive has been given a reasonable opportunity to cure this failure to comply within a period of time which is reasonable under the circumstances but not more than the thirty (30)-day period after written notice of such failure is provided to Executive;   provided   that if Executive cures this failure and then fails again to comply with the same provision of the Code of Conduct or the same written Company policy, no further opportunity to cure that failure shall be required; 
    
  (iii)  Executive s misappropriation (or attempted misappropriation) of a material amount of the Company s funds or property; 
    
  (iv)  Executive s conviction of, the entering of a guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere or no contest (or the equivalent), with respect to (A) either a felony or a crime that materially adversely affects or could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the Company or its business reputation; or (B) fraud, embezzlement, any felony offense involving dishonesty or constituting a breach of trust or moral turpitude;

As used herein, the term  Securities Laws  means any federal or state law, rule or regulation governing generally the issuance or exchange of securities, including without limitation the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the    Exchange Act

  No termination of Executive s employment shall be effective as a termination for Cause for purposes of this Agreement or any other  Company Arrangement  (as defined in Section 11(g)) unless Executive shall first have been given written notice by the Board of its intention to terminate his employment for Cause, such notice (the    Cause Notice   ) to state in detail the particular circumstances that constitute the grounds on which the proposed termination for Cause is based. If, within twenty (20) calendar days after such Cause Notice is given to Executive, the Board gives written notice to Executive confirming that, in the judgment of at least a majority of the members of the Board, Cause for terminating his employment on the basis set forth in the original Cause Notice exists, his employment hereunder shall thereupon be terminated for Cause, subject to de novo review, at Executive s election, through arbitration in accordance with Section 29. If Executive commits or is charged with committing any offense of the character or type specified in subparagraph 1(d)(iv), (v) or (vi) herein, then the Company at its option may suspend Executive with or

without pay and such suspension shall not constitute  Good Reason  hereunder or for purposes of any other arrangement with the Company. If Executive subsequently is convicted of, pleads guilty or nolo contendere (or equivalent plea) to, any such offense, Executive shall immediately repay the after-tax amount of any compensation paid in cash hereunder from the date of the suspension. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any stock option or equity incentive plan or award agreement, all vesting and all lapsing of restrictions on restricted shares shall be tolled during the period of suspension and all unvested options and restricted shares for which the restrictions have not lapsed shall terminate and not be exercisable by or issued to Executive if during or after such suspension Executive is convicted of, pleads guilty or nolo contendere (or equivalent plea) to, any offense specified in subparagraph 1(d)(iv) or (v).  However, if Executive is found not guilty of all offenses relating to his suspension, or the charges relating to all such offenses are otherwise dropped, Executive shall be entitled to immediate payment of any amounts not paid during the suspension and any awards as to which the vesting or lapsing of restrictions was tolled shall immediately vest and applicable restrictions shall immediately lapse.

  (ii)  the individuals who, as of the Effective Date, are members of the Board (the    Incumbent Board   ), cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board;   provided  ,   however  , that if the election, or nomination for election by the Company s common stockholders, of any new director (excluding any director whose nomination or election to the Board is the result of any actual or threatened proxy contest or settlement thereof) was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the Incumbent Board, such new director shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be considered as a member of the Incumbent Board; 
    
  (iii)  the consummation of a merger, consolidation or reorganization with or into the Company or in which securities of the Company are issued (a    Merger   ), unless such Merger is a Non-Control Transaction.

3

  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control shall not occur solely based on a filing of a Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding of the Company. 
    
  (f)     Code    shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  (k)  For purposes of this Agreement, Executive will be deemed to have a    Disability    if, due to illness, injury or a physical or medically recognized mental condition, (i) Executive is unable to perform Executive s duties under this Agreement with reasonable accommodation for one hundred and twenty (120) consecutive calendar days, or one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days during any twelve (12)-month period, as determined in accordance with this Section 1(k), or (ii) Executive is considered disabled for purposes of receiving/qualifying for long-term disability benefits under any group long-term disability insurance plan or policy offered by the Company in which Executive participates. The Disability of Executive will be determined by a medical doctor selected by written agreement of the Company and Executive upon the request of either Party by notice to the other, or (in the case of and with respect to any applicable long-term disability insurance policy or plan) will be determined according to the terms of the applicable long-term disability insurance policy/plan.  If the Company and Executive cannot agree on the selection of a medical doctor, each of them will select a medical doctor and the two medical doctors will select a third medical doctor who will determine whether Executive has a Disability.  The determination of the medical doctor selected under this Section 1(k) will be binding on both Parties.

(a)    Anything in this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent that any payment, distribution or acceleration of vesting to or for the benefit of Executive by the Company (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder), whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the    Total Payments   ), is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the    Excise Tax   ), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below) if and to the extent that a reduction in the Total Payments would result in Executive retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax), than if Executive received the entire amount of such Total Payments in accordance with their existing terms (taking into account federal, state, and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax). For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Safe Harbor Amount        means the largest portion of the Total Payments that would result in no portion of the Total Payments being subject to the Excise Tax. To effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Total Payments which are payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating non-cash payments, in each case, starting with the payments to be made farthest in time from the Determination (as defined below). 
    
  (b)  The determination of whether the Total Payments shall be reduced as provided in Section 12(a) and the amount of such reduction shall be made at the Company s expense by an accounting firm selected by Company from among the ten (10) largest accounting firms in the United States or by qualified independent tax counsel (the    Determining Party      provided   that Executive shall be given advance notice of the Determining Party selected by the Company, and shall have the opportunity to reject the selection, within two (2) business days of being notified of the selection, on the basis of that Determining Party s having a conflict of interest or other reasonable basis, in which case the Company shall select an alternative auditing firm among the ten largest accounting firms in the United States or alternative independent qualified tax counsel, which shall become the Determining Party.  Such Determining Party shall provide its determination (the    Determination   ), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and Executive, within ten (10) business days of the termination of Executive s employment or at such other time mutually agreed by the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive with respect to the Total Payments, it shall furnish Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable to Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such payments and, absent manifest error, such Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that an Excise Tax would be payable, the Company shall have the right to accept the Determination as to the extent of the reduction, if any, pursuant to Section 12(a), or to have such Determination reviewed by another accounting firm selected by the Company, at the Company s expense. If the two accounting firms do not agree, a third accounting firm shall be jointly chosen by Executive and the Company, in which case the determination of such third accounting firm shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. 
    
  (c)  If, notwithstanding any reduction described in this Section 12, the Internal Revenue Service (   IRS   ) determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of any of the Total Payments or otherwise, then Executive shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within thirty (30) calendar days after a final IRS determination or in the event that Executive challenges the final IRS determination, a final judicial determination, a portion of the Total Payments equal to the  Repayment Amount.  The    Repayment Amount    with respect to the payment of benefits shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax and all other applicable taxes imposed on the Payment) shall be maximized. The Repayment Amount shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not result in Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect  
  
   13 

to the Total Payments being maximized. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this Section 12(c), Executive shall pay the Excise Tax. 
    
  (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 12, if (i) there is a reduction in the Total Payments as described in this Section 12, (ii) the IRS later determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment of which would result in the maximization of Executive s net after-tax proceeds (calculated as if Executive s benefits had not previously been reduced), and (iii) Executive pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay to Executive those payments or benefits which were reduced pursuant to this Section 12 as soon as administratively possible after Executive pays the Excise Tax (but not later than March 15 following the calendar year of the IRS determination) so that Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments are maximized. 
    
  (e)  To the extent requested by Executive, the Company shall cooperate with Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Determining Party shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by Executive (including, without limitation, Executive s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant, before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q A-2(b) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q A-9 and Q A-40 to Q A-44 of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code and/or exempt from the definition of the term  parachute payment  within the meaning of Q A-2(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q A-5(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code. 
    
  13.      Competition/Confidentiality  . 
    
  (a)  Acknowledgments by Executive  . Executive acknowledges that: (i) on and following the Employment Effective Date and through the Term and as a part of Executive s employment, Executive has been and will be afforded access to Confidential Information (as defined below); (ii) public disclosure of such Confidential Information could have an adverse effect on the Company and its business; (iii) because Executive possesses substantial technical expertise and skill with respect to the Company s business, the Company desires to obtain exclusive ownership of each invention by Executive while Executive is employed by the Company, and the Company will be at a substantial competitive disadvantage if it fails to acquire exclusive ownership of each such invention by Executive; and (iv) the provisions of this Section 13 are reasonable and necessary to prevent the improper use or disclosure of Confidential Information and to provide the Company with exclusive ownership of all inventions and works made or created by Executive. 
    
  (b)  Confidential Information  . 
    
  (i)  Executive acknowledges that on and following the Employment Effective Date and through the Term Executive has had and will have access to and may obtain, develop, or learn of Confidential Information (as defined below) under and pursuant to a relationship of trust and confidence. Executive shall hold such Confidential Information in strictest confidence and never at any time, during or after Executive s employment terminates, directly or indirectly use for Executive s own benefit or otherwise (except in connection with the performance of any duties as an employee hereunder) any Confidential Information, or divulge, reveal, disclose or communicate any Confidential Information to any unauthorized person or entity in any manner whatsoever. 
    
  (ii)  As used in this Agreement, the term    Confidential Information        shall include, but not be limited to, any of the following information relating to the Company learned by Executive on

and following the Employment Effective Date and through the Term or as a result of Executive s employment with the Company: 
    
           (A)

    the identity of persons or entities actually conducting or considering conducting business with the Company, and any information in any form relating to such persons or entities and their relationship or dealings with the Company or its affiliates; 
       
           (C) 
    any trade secret or confidential information of or concerning any business operation or business relationship; 
       
           (D) 
    computer databases, software programs and information relating to the nature of the hardware or software and how said hardware or software is used in combination or alone; 
       
           (E) 
    information concerning Company personnel, confidential financial information, customer or customer prospect information, information concerning subscribers, subscriber and customer lists and data, methods and formulas for estimating costs and setting prices, engineering design standards, testing procedures, research results (such as marketing surveys, programming trials or product trials), cost data (such as billing, equipment and programming cost projection models), compensation information and models, business or marketing plans or strategies, deal or business terms, budgets, vendor names, programming operations, product names, information on proposed acquisitions or dispositions, actual performance compared to budgeted performance, long range plans, internal financial information (including but not limited to financial and operating results for certain offices, divisions, departments, and key market areas that are not disclosed to the public in such form), results of internal analyses, computer programs and programming information, techniques and designs, and trade secrets; 
       
           (F) 
    information concerning the Company s employees, officers, directors and shareholders; and 
       
           (G) 
    any other trade secret or information of a confidential or proprietary nature. 
       
  (iii)  Executive shall not make or use any notes or memoranda relating to any Confidential Information except for uses reasonably expected by Executive to be for the benefit of the Company, and will, at the Company s request, return each original and every copy of any and all notes, memoranda, correspondence, diagrams or other records, in written or other form, that Executive may at any time have within his possession or control that contain any Confidential Information. 
    
  (iv)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that has come within the public domain through no fault of or action by Executive or that has become rightfully available to Executive on a non-confidential basis from any third party, the disclosure of  
  
   15 

which to Executive does not violate any contractual or legal obligations that such third party has to the Company or its affiliates with respect to such Confidential Information. None of the foregoing obligations and restrictions applies to any part of the Confidential Information that Executive demonstrates was or became generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Executive or by any other person bound by a confidentiality obligation to the Company in respect of such Confidential Information. Further, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from using Confidential Information to the extent necessary to exercise any legally protected whistleblower rights (including pursuant to Rule 21F under the Exchange Act). 
    
  (v)    Executive will not remove from the Company s premises (except to the extent such removal is for purposes of the performance of Executive s duties at home or while traveling, or except as otherwise specifically authorized by the Company) any Company document, record, notebook, plan, model, component, device, or computer software or code, whether embodied in a disk or in any other form (collectively, the    Proprietary Items   ).      Executive recognizes that, as between the Company and Executive, all of the Proprietary Items, whether or not developed by Executive, are the exclusive property of the Company. Upon termination of Executive s employment by either Party, or upon the request of the Company on and following the Effective Date and through the Term, Executive will return to the Company all of the Proprietary Items in Executive s possession or subject to Executive s control, including all equipment (  e.g.  , laptop computers, cell phone, portable e-mail devices, etc.), documents, files and data, and Executive shall not retain any copies, abstracts, sketches, or other physical embodiment of any such Proprietary Items. 
    
  14.      Proprietary Developments  . 
    
  (a)  Developments  .  Any and all inventions, products, discoveries, improvements, processes, methods, computer software programs, models, techniques, or formulae (collectively, hereinafter referred to as    Developments   ), made, conceived, developed, or created by Executive (alone or in conjunction with others, during regular work hours or otherwise) during Executive s employment which may be directly or indirectly useful in, or relate to, the business conducted or to be conducted by the Company will be promptly disclosed by Executive to the Company and shall be the Company s exclusive property. The term  Developments  shall not be deemed to include inventions, products, discoveries, improvements, processes, methods, computer software programs, models, techniques, or formulae which were in the possession of Executive prior to the Employment Effective Date. Executive hereby transfers and assigns to the Company all proprietary rights that Executive may have or acquire in any Developments and Executive waives any other special right which Executive may have or accrue therein. Executive will execute any documents and take any actions that may be required, in the reasonable determination of the Company s counsel, to effect and confirm such assignment, transfer and waiver, to direct the issuance of patents, trademarks, or copyrights to the Company with respect to such Developments as are to be the Company s exclusive property or to vest in the Company title to such Developments;   provided  ,     however  , that the expense of securing any patent, trademark or copyright shall be borne by Company. The Parties agree that Developments shall constitute Confidential Information. 
    
  (b)  Work Made for Hire  .  Any work performed by Executive during Executive s employment with the Company shall be considered a  Work Made for Hire  as defined in the U.S. Copyright laws, and shall be owned by and for the express benefit of the Company. In the event it should be established that such work does not qualify as a Work Made for Hire, Executive agrees to and does hereby assign to the Company all of Executive s right, title, and interest in such work product including, but not limited to, all copyrights and other proprietary rights. 

16 

15.      Non-Competition and Non-Interference  . 
    
  (a)  Acknowledgments by Executive  .  Executive acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the services to be performed by Executive under this Agreement are of a special, unique, unusual, extraordinary, and intellectual character; (ii) the Company competes with other businesses that are or could be located in any part of the world; (iii) the provisions of this Section 15 are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company s business and lawful protectable interests, and do not impair Executive s ability to earn a living; and (iv) the Company has agreed to provide the severance and other benefits set forth in Sections 11(b)(A)-(F) and 11(f)(first sentence, clause (III)) in consideration for Executive s abiding by the obligations under this Section 15 and but for Executive s agreement to comply with such obligations, the Company would not have agreed to provide such severance and other benefits. 
    
  (b)  Covenants of Executive  .  For purposes of this Section 15, the term    Restricted Period    shall mean the period commencing on the Effective Date and terminating on the first anniversary (or, in the case of Section 15(b)(iii), the second anniversary) of the Date of Termination.  In consideration of the acknowledgments by Executive, and in consideration of the compensation and benefits to be paid or provided to Executive by the Company, Executive covenants and agrees that during the Restricted Period, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, for Executive s own benefit or for the benefit of any other person or entity other than the Company: 
    
  (i)    in the United States or any other country or territory where the Company then conducts its business: engage in, operate, finance, control or be employed by a  Competitive Business  (as defined below); serve as an officer or director of a Competitive Business (regardless of where Executive then lives or conducts such activities); perform any work as an employee, consultant (other than as a member of a professional consultancy, law firm, accounting firm or similar professional enterprise that has been retained by the Competitive Business and where Executive has no direct role in such professional consultancy and maintains the confidentiality of all information acquired by Executive during his or her employment with the Company), contractor, or in any other capacity with, a Competitive Business; directly or indirectly invest or own any interest in a Competitive Business (regardless of where Executive then lives or conducts such activities); or directly or indirectly provide any services or advice to any business, person or entity who or which is engaged in a Competitive Business (other than as a member of a professional consultancy, law firm, accounting firm or similar professional enterprise that has been retained by the Competitive Business and where Executive has no direct role in such professional consultancy and maintains the confidentiality of all information acquired by Executive during his or her employment with the Company).  A    Competitive Business    is any business, person or entity who or which, anywhere within that part of the United States, or that part of any other country or territory, where the Company conducts business (A) owns or operates a cable television system; (B) provides direct television or any satellite based, telephone system based, internet based or wireless system for delivering television, music or other entertainment programming (other than as an ancillary service, such as cellular telephone providers); (C) provides telephony services using any wired connection or fixed (as opposed to mobile) wireless application; (D) provides data or internet access services; (E) offers, provides, markets or sells any service or product of a type that is offered or marketed by or directly competitive with a service or product offered or marketed by the Company at the time Executive s employment terminates and, in the case of this clause (E), which produced greater than ten percent (10%) of the Company s revenues in the calendar year immediately prior to the year in which employment terminated; or (F) who or which in any case is preparing or planning to do any of the activities described in the preceding clauses (A) through (E). The provisions of this Section 15 shall not be construed or applied (I) so as to prohibit Executive from owning not more than five percent (5%) of any class of securities that is publicly traded on any national or regional securities exchange, as long as Executive s investment is passive and Executive does not lend or provide any services or advice to such business or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement in connection  
  
   17 

with such investment; or (II) so as to prohibit Executive from working as an employee in the cable television business for a company/business that owns or operates cable television franchises (by way of example as of the Effective Date only, Altice, Cox or Comcast),   provided   that the company/business is not providing cable services in any political subdivision/ geographic area where the Company has a franchise or provides cable services (other than nominal overlaps of service areas) and the company/business is otherwise not engaged in a Competitive Business, and   provided   that Executive does not otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement in connection with that work; and   provided     further   that nothing in this Section 15(b)(i) shall abrogate or affect any provision regarding the effect of Executive s working for a company/business that owns or operates cable television franchises (including, as of the Effective Date only, Altice, Cox and Comcast) in any stock option or other equity award agreement between Executive and the Company; 
    
  (ii)  contact, solicit or provide any service in connection with any Competitive Business to any person or entity that was a customer franchisee, or prospective customer of the Company at any time during Executive s employment (a prospective customer being one to whom the Company had made a business proposal within twelve (12) months prior to the time Executive s employment terminated); or directly solicit or encourage any customer, franchisee or subscriber of the Company to purchase any service or product of a type offered by or competitive with any product or service provided by the Company, or to reduce the amount or level of business purchased by such customer, franchisee or subscriber from the Company; or take away or procure for the benefit of any Competitive Business, any business of a type provided by or competitive with a product or service offered by the Company; or 
    
  (iii)  solicit or recruit for employment, or hire or attempt to hire, any person or persons who are employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or who were so employed at any time within a period of six (6) months immediately prior to the Date of Termination, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between any such person and the Company; nor will Executive assist anyone else in recruiting any such employee to work for another company or business or discuss with any such person his or her leaving the employ of the Company or engaging in a business activity in competition with the Company. This provision shall not apply to secretarial, clerical, custodial or maintenance employees, nor shall it prohibit Executive from providing a personal reference for the person or persons described in this subsection in response to a request for such a personal reference. 
    
  If Executive violates any covenant contained in this Section 15, then the term of the covenants in this Section shall be extended by the period of time Executive was in violation of the same. 
    
  (c)  Provisions Pertaining to the Covenants  .  Executive recognizes that the existing business of the Company extends to various locations and areas throughout the United States and will extend hereafter to other countries and territories and agrees that the scope of this Section 15 shall extend to any part of the United States, and any other country or territory, where the Company operates or conducts business, or has concrete plans to do so at the time Executive s employment terminates.  It is agreed that Executive s services hereunder are special, unique, unusual and extraordinary giving them peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated for by damages, and in the event of Executive s breach of this Section, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise in addition to the cessation of payments and benefits hereunder.  If any provision of Section 13, 14 or 15 is deemed to be unenforceable by a court (whether because of the subject matter of the provision, the duration of a restriction, the geographic or other scope of a restriction or otherwise), that provision shall not be rendered void but the Parties instead agree that the court shall amend and alter such provision to such lesser degree, time, scope, extent and/or territory as will grant the Company the maximum restriction on Executive s activities permitted by applicable law in such circumstances. The Company s failure to exercise its rights to enforce the provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected by the existence or non-existence  
  
   18 

of any other similar agreement for anyone else employed by the Company or by the Company s failure to exercise any of its rights under any such agreement. 
    
  (d)  Notices  .  In order to preserve the Company s rights under this Agreement, the Company is authorized to advise any potential or future employer, any third party with whom Executive may become employed or enter into any business or contractual relationship with, and any third party whom Executive may contact for any such purpose, of the existence of this Agreement and its terms, and the Company shall not be liable for doing so. 
    
  (e)  Injunctive Relief and Additional Remedy  .  Executive acknowledges that the injury that would be suffered by Company as a result of a breach of the provisions of this Agreement (including any provision of Sections 13, 14 and 15) would be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to the Company for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, the Company will have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce any provision of this Agreement, and the Company will not be obligated to post bond or other security in seeking such relief.  Without limiting the Company s rights under this Section or any other remedies of the Company, in the event of a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, as to which no further appeal can be taken or as to which the time to appeal has expired, that Executive has willfully breached a material obligation under Section 13, 14 or 15, (i) the Company will have the right to cease making any payments otherwise due to Executive under this Agreement and (ii) Executive will repay to the Company all amounts paid to him under this Agreement on and following the date that such breach first occurred (as determined by the court), including but not limited to the return of any stock and options (and stock purchased through the exercise of options) that first became vested following such date, and the proceeds of the sale of any such stock.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive s breach of a material obligation under Section 13, 14 or 15 is curable, prior to seeking the remedies contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall provide Executive written notice of such breach and Executive shall be given ten (10) business days from receipt of such written notice to cure, provided, that if Executive cures such breach and then breaches again, no further opportunity to cure shall be provided. 
    
  (f)  Covenants of Sections 13, 14 and 15 are Essential and Independent Covenants  .  The covenants by Executive in Sections 13, 14 and 15 are essential elements of this Agreement, and without Executive s agreement to comply with such covenants, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement or employed Executive. The Company and Executive have independently consulted their respective counsel and have been advised in all respects concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants, with specific regard to the nature of the business conducted by the Company. Executive s covenants in Sections 13, 14 and 15 are independent covenants and the existence of any claim by Executive against the Company, under this Agreement or otherwise, will not excuse Executive s breach of any covenant in Section 13, 14 or 15. If Executive s employment hereunder is terminated, this Agreement will continue in full force and effect as is necessary or appropriate to enforce the covenants and agreements of Executive in Sections 13, 14 and 15. The Company s right to enforce the covenants in Sections 13, 14 and 15 shall not be adversely affected or limited by the Company s failure to have an agreement with another employee with provisions at least as restrictive as those contained in Section 13, 14 or 15, or by the Company s failure or inability to enforce (or agreement not to enforce) in full the provisions of any other or similar agreement containing one or more restrictions of the type specified in Sections 13, 14 and 15. 
    
  16.      Representations and Further Agreements  . 
    
  (a)  Executive represents, warrants and covenants to the Company that Executive is knowledgeable and sophisticated as to business matters, including the subject matter of this Agreement, and  
  
   19 

that prior to assenting to the terms of this Agreement, or giving the representations and warranties herein, Executive has been given a reasonable time to review it and has consulted with counsel of Executive s choice; and 
    
  (b)  During Executive s employment with the Company and subsequent to the cessation thereof, Executive will reasonably cooperate with Company, and furnish any and all complete and truthful information, testimony or affidavits in connection with any matter that arose during Executive s employment, that in any way relates to the business or operations of the Company or any of its parent or subsidiary corporations or affiliates, or of which Executive may have any knowledge or involvement; and will consult with and provide information to the Company and its representatives concerning such matters. Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in the protection and enforcement of any intellectual property rights that relate to services performed by Executive for Company, whether under the terms of this Agreement or prior to the execution of this Agreement. This shall include without limitation executing, acknowledging, and delivering to the Company all documents or papers that may be necessary to enable the Company to publish or protect such intellectual property rights. Subsequent to the cessation of Executive s employment with the Company, the Parties will make their best efforts to have such cooperation performed at reasonable times and places and in a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with any other employment in which Executive may then be engaged. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as requiring Executive to provide any testimony, sworn statement or declaration that is not complete and truthful. If the Company requires Executive to travel outside the metropolitan area in the United States where Executive then resides to provide any testimony or otherwise provide any such assistance, then the Company will reimburse Executive for any reasonable, ordinary and necessary travel and lodging expenses incurred by Executive to do so;   provided   that Executive submits all documentation required under the Company s standard travel expense reimbursement policies and as otherwise may be required to satisfy any requirements under applicable tax laws for the Company to deduct those expenses. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as requiring Executive to provide any testimony or affidavit that is not complete and truthful. 
    
  (c)  The Company represents and warrants that (i) it is fully authorized by action of the Board (and of any other Person or body whose action is required) to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under it, (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by it does not violate any applicable law, regulation, order, judgment or decree or any agreement, arrangement, plan or corporate governance document to which it is a party or by which it is bound, and (iii) upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties, this Agreement shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally. 
    
  17.  Mutual Non-Disparagement  .  Neither the Company nor Executive shall make any oral or written statement about the other Party which is intended or reasonably likely to disparage the other Party, or otherwise degrade the other Party s reputation in the business or legal community or in the telecommunications industry. 
    
  18.  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  .  Executive agrees to comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the    FCPA   ), which provides generally that: under no circumstances will foreign officials, representatives, political parties or holders of public offices be offered, promised or paid any money, remuneration, things of value, or provided any other benefit, direct or indirect, in connection with obtaining or maintaining contracts or orders hereunder.  When any representative, employee, agent, or other individual or organization associated with Executive is required to perform any obligation related to or in connection with this Agreement, the substance of this  
  
   20 

section shall be imposed upon such person and included in any agreement between Executive and any such person.  A material violation by Executive of the provisions of the FCPA shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Company to terminate Executive s employment for Cause in accordance with Section 10(a)(iii). 
    
  19.  Purchases and Sales of the Company s Securities  .  Executive has read and agrees to comply in all respects with the Company s Policy Regarding the Purchase and Sale of the Company s Securities by Employees (the    Policy   ), as the Policy may be amended from time to time.  Specifically, and without limitation, Executive agrees that Executive shall not purchase or sell stock in the Company at any time (a) that Executive possesses material non-public information about the Company or any of its businesses; and (b) during any  Trading Blackout Period  as may be determined by the Company as set forth in the Policy from time to time. 
    
  21.  Withholding  . Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to be made by the Company hereunder to Executive or his estate or beneficiary shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the Company may reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant to applicable law or regulation, and other withholding amounts authorized by Executive. 
    
  22.  Notices  . Any written notice required by this Agreement will be deemed provided and delivered to the intended recipient when (a) delivered in person by hand; (b) on the date of transmission, if delivered by confirmed facsimile; (c) three (3) calendar days after being sent via U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested; or (d) the calendar day after being sent via overnight courier, in each case when such notice is properly addressed to the following address and with all postage and similar fees having been paid in advance: 
    
  If to the Company:     Charter Communications, Inc.

  Either Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands and other communications to such Party shall be delivered personally or mailed by giving written notice to the other Party in the manner described above. 
    
  23.  Binding Effect  .  This Agreement shall be for the benefit of and binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, legal representatives, successors and, where applicable, assigns. 
    
  24.  Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to its specific subject matter and supersedes any prior oral and written communications, agreements and understandings among the Parties concerning the specific subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the Prior Employment Agreement.  This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered, waived or rescinded in any manner, except by written instrument signed by both of the Parties hereto that expressly refers to the provision of this Agreement that is being modified, amended, altered, waived or  
  
   21 

rescinded;   provided  ,     however  , that the waiver by either Party of a breach or compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not operate nor be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or compliance. 
    
  25.  Severability  .  In case any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected in accordance with the terms hereof to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall have no force and effect, but such holding shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement;   provided   that the provisions held illegal, invalid or unenforceable do not reflect or manifest a fundamental benefit bargained for by a Party hereto. 
    
  26.  Assignment  .  Without limitation of Executive s right to terminate for Good Reason under Section 10(a)(iv), this Agreement can be assigned by the Company only to a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company and which assumes all of the Company s obligations hereunder.  The duties and covenants of Executive under this Agreement, being personal, may not be assigned or delegated except that Executive may assign payments due hereunder to a trust established for the benefit of Executive s family or to Executive s estate or to any partnership or trust entered into by Executive and/or Executive s immediate family members (meaning Executive s spouse and lineal descendants).  This Agreement shall be binding in all respects on permissible assignees. 
    
  27.  Notification.    In order to preserve the Company s rights under this Agreement, the Company is authorized to advise any third party with whom Executive may become employed or enter into any business or contractual relationship with, or whom Executive may contact for any such purpose, of the existence of this Agreement and its terms, and the Company shall not be liable for doing so. 
    
  28.  Choice of Law/Jurisdiction  .  This Agreement is deemed to be accepted and entered into in Delaware.  Executive and the Company intend and hereby acknowledge that jurisdiction over disputes with regard to this Agreement, and over all aspects of the relationship between the Parties, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to its rules governing conflicts of laws.  With respect to orders in aid or enforcement of arbitration awards and injunctive relief, venue and jurisdiction are proper in any county in Delaware, and (if federal jurisdiction exists) any United States District Court in Delaware, and the Parties waive all objections to jurisdiction and venue in any such forum and any defense that such forum is not the most convenient forum. 
    
  29.  Arbitration  .  Any claim or dispute between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any other agreement between the Parties, Executive s employment with the Company, or any termination thereof (collectively,    Covered Claims   ) shall (except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 15(e) with respect to certain requests for injunctive relief) be resolved by binding confidential arbitration, to be held in Wilmington, Delaware, before a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with the National Rules for Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association and this Section 29. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Pending the resolution of any Covered Claim, Executive (and his beneficiaries) shall continue to receive all payments and benefits due under this Agreement or otherwise, except to the extent that the arbitrators otherwise provide. The Company shall reimburse Executive for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, legal, tax and accounting fees) incurred by him in any arbitration under this Section 29, to the extent he substantially prevails in any such arbitration. 
    
  30.  Section Headings  .  The section headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any manner the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

22 

31.  Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  This Agreement may also be executed by delivery of facsimile or  .pdf  signatures, which shall be effective for all purposes. 
    
  32.  Section 409A Compliance  . 
    
  (a)    This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code or an exemption thereto, and, to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of a penalty tax on Executive under Section 409A of the Code, payments may only be made under this Agreement upon an event and in a manner permitted by Section 409A of the Code.  Any payments or benefits that are provided upon a termination of employment shall, to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of a penalty tax on Executive under Section 409A of the Code, not be provided unless such termination constitutes a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  Any payments that qualify for the  short term deferral  exception or another exception under Section 409A of the Code shall be paid under the applicable exception.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is considered a  specified employee  (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), any amounts paid or provided under this Agreement shall, to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of a penalty tax on Executive under Section 409A of the Code, be delayed for six (6) months after Executive s  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and the accumulated amounts shall be paid in a lump sum within ten (10) calendar days after the end of the six (6)-month period. If Executive dies during the six (6)-month postponement period prior to the payment of benefits, the amounts the payment of which is deferred on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the personal representative of Executive s estate within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of Executive s death.

effective performance by Executive of Executive s duties under this Agreement, and, if such failure is curable, if Executive has been given a reasonable opportunity to cure this failure to comply within a period of time which is reasonable under the circumstances but not more than the thirty (30)-day period after written notice of such failure is provided to Executive;   provided   that if Executive cures this failure and then fails again to comply with the same provision of the Code of Conduct or the same written Company policy, no further opportunity to cure that failure shall be required;

If, within twenty (20) calendar days after such Cause Notice is given to  
  
   2 

Executive, the Board gives written notice to Executive confirming that, in the judgment of at least a majority of the members of the Board, Cause for terminating his employment on the basis set forth in the original Cause Notice exists, his employment hereunder shall thereupon be terminated for Cause, subject to de novo review, at Executive s election, through arbitration in accordance with Section 29.

  (i)  Survival  .  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the respective rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall survive any termination of Executive s employment. 
  12.  Excess Parachute Payment  . 
  (a)  Anything in this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, to 
  the extent that any payment, distribution or acceleration of vesting to or for the benefit of Executive by the Company (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder), whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the    Total Payments   ), is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the    Excise Tax   ), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below) if and to the extent that a reduction in the Total Payments would result in Executive retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax), than if Executive received the entire amount of such Total Payments in accordance with their existing terms (taking into account federal, state, and local income and employment taxes and the 
  
   12 

Excise Tax). For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Safe Harbor Amount        means the largest portion of the Total Payments that would result in no portion of the Total Payments being subject to the Excise Tax. To effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Total Payments which are payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating non-cash payments, in each case, starting with the payments to be made farthest in time from the Determination (as defined below). 
    
  (b)  The determination of whether the Total Payments shall be reduced as provided in Section 12(a) and the amount of such reduction shall be made at the Company s expense by an accounting firm selected by Company from among the ten (10) largest accounting firms in the United States or by qualified independent tax counsel (the    Determining Party      provided   that Executive shall be given advance notice of the Determining Party selected by the Company, and shall have the opportunity to reject the selection, within two (2) business days of being notified of the selection, on the basis of that Determining Party s having a conflict of interest or other reasonable basis, in which case the Company shall select an alternative auditing firm among the ten largest accounting firms in the United States or alternative independent qualified tax counsel, which shall become the Determining Party.  Such Determining Party shall provide its determination (the    Determination   ), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and Executive, within ten (10) business days of the termination of Executive s employment or at such other time mutually agreed by the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive with respect to the Total Payments, it shall furnish Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable to Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such payments and, absent manifest error, such Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that an Excise Tax would be payable, the Company shall have the right to accept the Determination as to the extent of the reduction, if any, pursuant to Section 12(a), or to have such Determination reviewed by another accounting firm selected by the Company, at the Company s expense. If the two accounting firms do not agree, a third accounting firm shall be jointly chosen by Executive and the Company, in which case the determination of such third accounting firm shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. 
    
  (c)  If, notwithstanding any reduction described in this Section 12, the Internal Revenue Service (   IRS   ) determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of any of the Total Payments or otherwise, then Executive shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within thirty (30) calendar days after a final IRS determination or in the event that Executive challenges the final IRS determination, a final judicial determination, a portion of the Total Payments equal to the  Repayment Amount.  The    Repayment Amount    with respect to the payment of benefits shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax and all other applicable taxes imposed on the Payment) shall be maximized. The Repayment Amount shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not result in Executive s net after-tax proceeds  
  
   13 

with respect to the Total Payments being maximized. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this Section 12(c), Executive shall pay the Excise Tax. 
    
  (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 12, if (i) there is a reduction in the Total Payments as described in this Section 12, (ii) the IRS later determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment of which would result in the maximization of Executive s net after-tax proceeds (calculated as if Executive s benefits had not previously been reduced), and (iii) Executive pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay to Executive those payments or benefits which were reduced pursuant to this Section 12 as soon as administratively possible after Executive pays the Excise Tax (but not later than March 15 following the calendar year of the IRS determination) so that Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments are maximized. 
    
  (e)  To the extent requested by Executive, the Company shall cooperate with Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Determining Party shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by Executive (including, without limitation, Executive s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant, before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q A-2(b) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q A-9 and Q A-40 to Q A-44 of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code and/or exempt from the definition of the term  parachute payment  within the meaning of Q A-2(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q A-5(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code.

The provisions of this Section 15 shall not be construed or applied (I) so as to prohibit Executive from owning not more than five percent (5%) of any class of securities that is publicly traded on any national or regional securities exchange, as long as Executive s investment is passive and Executive does not lend or provide any services or advice to such business or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement in connection with such investment; or (II) so as to prohibit Executive from working as an employee in the cable television business for a company/business that owns or operates cable television franchises (by way of example as of the Effective Date only, Altice, Cox or Comcast),   provided   that the company/business is not providing cable services in any political subdivision/ geographic area where the Company has a franchise or provides cable services (other than nominal overlaps of service areas) and the company/business is otherwise not engaged in a Competitive Business, and   provided   that Executive does not otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement in connection with that work; and   provided     further   that nothing in this Section 15(b)(i) shall abrogate or affect any provision regarding the effect of Executive s working for a company/business that owns or operates cable television franchises (including, as of the Effective Date only, Altice, Cox and Comcast) in any stock option or other equity award agreement between Executive and the Company; 
    
  (ii)  contact, solicit or provide any service in connection with any Competitive Business to any person or entity that was a customer franchisee, or prospective customer of the Company at any time during Executive s employment (a prospective customer being one to whom the Company had made a business proposal within twelve (12) months prior to the time Executive s employment terminated); or directly solicit or encourage any customer, franchisee or subscriber of the Company to purchase any service or product of a type offered by  
  
   18 

or competitive with any product or service provided by the Company, or to reduce the amount or level of business purchased by such customer, franchisee or subscriber from the Company; or take away or procure for the benefit of any Competitive Business, any business of a type provided by or competitive with a product or service offered by the Company; or 
    
  (iii)  solicit or recruit for employment, or hire or attempt to hire, any person or persons who are employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or who were so employed at any time within a period of six (6) months immediately prior to the Date of Termination, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between any such person and the Company; nor will Executive assist anyone else in recruiting any such employee to work for another company or business or discuss with any such person his or her leaving the employ of the Company or engaging in a business activity in competition with the Company. This provision shall not apply to secretarial, clerical, custodial or maintenance employees, nor shall it prohibit Executive from providing a personal reference for the person or persons described in this subsection in response to a request for such a personal reference. 
  If Executive violates any covenant contained in this Section 15, then the term of the covenants in this Section shall be extended by the period of time Executive was in violation of the same. 
    
  (c)  Provisions Pertaining to the Covenants  .  Executive recognizes that the existing business of the Company extends to various locations and areas throughout the United States and will extend hereafter to other countries and territories and agrees that the scope of this Section 15 shall extend to any part of the United States, and any other country or territory, where the Company operates or conducts business, or has concrete plans to do so at the time Executive s employment terminates.  It is agreed that Executive s services hereunder are special, unique, unusual and extraordinary giving them peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated for by damages, and in the event of Executive s breach of this Section, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise in addition to the cessation of payments and benefits hereunder.  If any provision of Section 13, 14 or 15 is deemed to be unenforceable by a court (whether because of the subject matter of the provision, the duration of a restriction, the geographic or other scope of a restriction or otherwise), that provision shall not be rendered void but the Parties instead agree that the court shall amend and alter such provision to such lesser degree, time, scope, extent and/or territory as will grant the Company the maximum restriction on Executive s activities permitted by applicable law in such circumstances. The Company s failure to exercise its rights to enforce the provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected by the existence or non-existence of any other similar agreement for anyone else employed by the Company or by the Company s failure to exercise any of its rights under any such agreement. 
    
  (d)  Notices  .  In order to preserve the Company s rights under this Agreement, the Company is authorized to advise any potential or future employer, any third party with whom Executive may become employed or enter into any business or contractual relationship with, and any third party whom Executive may contact for any such purpose, of the existence of this Agreement and its terms, and the Company shall not be liable for doing so. 
    
  (e)  Injunctive Relief and Additional Remedy  .  Executive acknowledges that the injury that would be suffered by Company as a result of a breach of the provisions of this 
  
   19 

Agreement (including any provision of Sections 13, 14 and 15) would be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to the Company for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, the Company will have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce any provision of this Agreement, and the Company will not be obligated to post bond or other security in seeking such relief.  Without limiting the Company s rights under this Section or any other remedies of the Company, in the event of a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, as to which no further appeal can be taken or as to which the time to appeal has expired, that Executive has willfully breached a material obligation under Section 13, 14 or 15, (i) the Company will have the right to cease making any payments otherwise due to Executive under this Agreement and (ii) Executive will repay to the Company all amounts paid to him under this Agreement on and following the date that such breach first occurred (as determined by the court), including but not limited to the return of any stock and options (and stock purchased through the exercise of options) that first became vested following such date, and the proceeds of the sale of any such stock.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive s breach of a material obligation under Section 13, 14 or 15 is curable, prior to seeking the remedies contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall provide Executive written notice of such breach and Executive shall be given ten (10) business days from receipt of such written notice to cure, provided, that if Executive cures such breach and then breaches again, no further opportunity to cure shall be provided. 
    
  (f)  Covenants of Sections 13, 14 and 15 are Essential and Independent Covenants  .  The covenants by Executive in Sections 13, 14 and 15 are essential elements of this Agreement, and without Executive s agreement to comply with such covenants, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement or employed Executive. The Company and Executive have independently consulted their respective counsel and have been advised in all respects concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants, with specific regard to the nature of the business conducted by the Company. Executive s covenants in Sections 13, 14 and 15 are independent covenants and the existence of any claim by Executive against the Company, under this Agreement or otherwise, will not excuse Executive s breach of any covenant in Section 13, 14 or 15. If Executive s employment hereunder is terminated, this Agreement will continue in full force and effect as is necessary or appropriate to enforce the covenants and agreements of Executive in Sections 13, 14 and 15. The Company s right to enforce the covenants in Sections 13, 14 and 15 shall not be adversely affected or limited by the Company s failure to have an agreement with another employee with provisions at least as restrictive as those contained in Section 13, 14 or 15, or by the Company s failure or inability to enforce (or agreement not to enforce) in full the provisions of any other or similar agreement containing one or more restrictions of the type specified in Sections 13, 14 and 15. 
  16.        Representations and Further Agreements  . 
    
  (a)  Executive represents, warrants and covenants to the Company that Executive is knowledgeable and sophisticated as to business matters, including the subject matter of this Agreement, and that prior to assenting to the terms of this Agreement, or giving the representations and warranties herein, Executive has been given a reasonable time to review it and has consulted with counsel of Executive s choice; and 
  
   20 

(b)  During Executive s employment with the Company and subsequent to the cessation thereof, Executive will reasonably cooperate with Company, and furnish any and all complete and truthful information, testimony or affidavits in connection with any matter that arose during Executive s employment, that in any way relates to the business or operations of the Company or any of its parent or subsidiary corporations or affiliates, or of which Executive may have any knowledge or involvement; and will consult with and provide information to the Company and its representatives concerning such matters. Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in the protection and enforcement of any intellectual property rights that relate to services performed by Executive for Company, whether under the terms of this Agreement or prior to the execution of this Agreement. This shall include without limitation executing, acknowledging, and delivering to the Company all documents or papers that may be necessary to enable the Company to publish or protect such intellectual property rights. Subsequent to the cessation of Executive s employment with the Company, the Parties will make their best efforts to have such cooperation performed at reasonable times and places and in a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with any other employment in which Executive may then be engaged. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as requiring Executive to provide any testimony, sworn statement or declaration that is not complete and truthful. If the Company requires Executive to travel outside the metropolitan area in the United States where Executive then resides to provide any testimony or otherwise provide any such assistance, then the Company will reimburse Executive for any reasonable, ordinary and necessary travel and lodging expenses incurred by Executive to do so;   provided   that Executive submits all documentation required under the Company s standard travel expense reimbursement policies and as otherwise may be required to satisfy any requirements under applicable tax laws for the Company to deduct those expenses. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as requiring Executive to provide any testimony or affidavit that is not complete and truthful. 
    
  (c)  The Company represents and warrants that (i) it is fully authorized by action of the Board (and of any other Person or body whose action is required) to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under it, (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by it does not violate any applicable law, regulation, order, judgment or decree or any agreement, arrangement, plan or corporate governance document to which it is a party or by which it is bound, and (iii) upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties, this Agreement shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally. 
    
  17.  Mutual Non-Disparagement  .  Neither the Company nor Executive shall make any oral or written statement about the other Party which is intended or reasonably likely to disparage the other Party, or otherwise degrade the other Party s reputation in the business or legal community or in the telecommunications industry. 
    
  18.  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  .  Executive agrees to comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the    FCPA   ), which provides generally that: under no circumstances will foreign officials, representatives, political parties or holders of public offices be offered, promised or  
  
   21 

paid any money, remuneration, things of value, or provided any other benefit, direct or indirect, in connection with obtaining or maintaining contracts or orders hereunder.  When any representative, employee, agent, or other individual or organization associated with Executive is required to perform any obligation related to or in connection with this Agreement, the substance of this section shall be imposed upon such person and included in any agreement between Executive and any such person.  A material violation by Executive of the provisions of the FCPA shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Company to terminate Executive s employment for Cause in accordance with Section 10(a)(iii). 
    
  19.  Purchases and Sales of the Company s Securities  .  Executive has read and agrees to comply in all respects with the Company s Policy Regarding the Purchase and Sale of the Company s Securities by Employees (the    Policy   ), as the Policy may be amended from time to time.  Specifically, and without limitation, Executive agrees that Executive shall not purchase or sell stock in the Company at any time (a) that Executive possesses material non-public information about the Company or any of its businesses; and (b) during any  Trading Blackout Period  as may be determined by the Company as set forth in the Policy from time to time. 
    
  21.  Withholding  .  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to be made by the Company hereunder to Executive or his estate or beneficiary shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the Company may reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant to applicable law or regulation, and other withholding amounts authorized by Executive. 
    
  22.  Notices  .  Any written notice required by this Agreement will be deemed provided and delivered to the intended recipient when (a) delivered in person by hand; (b) on the date of transmission, if delivered by confirmed facsimile; (c) three (3) calendar days after being sent via U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested; or (d) the calendar day after being sent via overnight courier, in each case when such notice is properly addressed to the following address and with all postage and similar fees having been paid in advance:

    400 Atlantic Street 
    Stamford, Connecticut 06901 
    Attention: General Counsel

  If to Executive, to the home address and facsimile number of Executive most recently on file in the records of the Company; 
  Either Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands and other communications to such Party shall be delivered personally or mailed by giving written notice to the other Party in the manner described above. 
  23.  Binding Effect  .  This Agreement shall be for the benefit of and binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, legal representatives, successors and, where applicable, assigns. 
  
   22 

24.  Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to its specific subject matter and supersedes any prior oral and written communications, agreements and understandings among the Parties concerning the specific subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the Prior Employment Agreement.  This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered, waived or rescinded in any manner, except by written instrument signed by both of the Parties hereto that expressly refers to the provision of this Agreement that is being modified, amended, altered, waived or rescinded;   provided  ,     however  , that the waiver by either Party of a breach or compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not operate nor be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or compliance. 
    
  25.  Severability  .  In case any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected in accordance with the terms hereof to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall have no force and effect, but such holding shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement;   provided   that the provisions held illegal, invalid or unenforceable do not reflect or manifest a fundamental benefit bargained for by a Party hereto. 
    
  26.  Assignment  .  Without limitation of Executive s right to terminate for Good Reason under Section 10(a)(iv), this Agreement can be assigned by the Company only to a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company and which assumes all of the Company s obligations hereunder.  The duties and covenants of Executive under this Agreement, being personal, may not be assigned or delegated except that Executive may assign payments due hereunder to a trust established for the benefit of Executive s family or to Executive s estate or to any partnership or trust entered into by Executive and/or Executive s immediate family members (meaning Executive s spouse and lineal descendants).  This Agreement shall be binding in all respects on permissible assignees. 
    
  27.  Notification.    In order to preserve the Company s rights under this Agreement, the Company is authorized to advise any third party with whom Executive may become employed or enter into any business or contractual relationship with, or whom Executive may contact for any such purpose, of the existence of this Agreement and its terms, and the Company shall not be liable for doing so. 
    
  28.  Choice of Law/Jurisdiction  .  This Agreement is deemed to be accepted and entered into in Delaware.  Executive and the Company intend and hereby acknowledge that jurisdiction over disputes with regard to this Agreement, and over all aspects of the relationship between the Parties, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to its rules governing conflicts of laws.  With respect to orders in aid or enforcement of arbitration awards and injunctive relief, venue and jurisdiction are proper in any county in Delaware, and (if federal jurisdiction exists) any United States District Court in Delaware, and the Parties waive all objections to jurisdiction and venue in any such forum and any defense that such forum is not the most convenient forum. 
    
  29.  Arbitration  .  Any claim or dispute between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any other agreement between the Parties, Executive s employment with the Company, or any termination thereof (collectively,    Covered Claims   ) shall (except to the extent  
  
   23 

otherwise provided in Section 15(e) with respect to certain requests for injunctive relief) be resolved by binding confidential arbitration, to be held in Wilmington, Delaware, before a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with the National Rules for Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association and this Section 29. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Pending the resolution of any Covered Claim, Executive (and his beneficiaries) shall continue to receive all payments and benefits due under this Agreement or otherwise, except to the extent that the arbitrators otherwise provide. The Company shall reimburse Executive for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, legal, tax and accounting fees) incurred by him in any arbitration under this Section 29, to the extent he substantially prevails in any such arbitration. 
    
  30.  Section Headings  .  The section headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any manner the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 
    
  31.  Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  This Agreement may also be executed by delivery of facsimile or  .pdf  signatures, which shall be effective for all purposes. 
    
  32.  Section 409A Compliance  . 
  (a)  This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code or an exemption thereto, and, to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of a penalty tax on Executive under Section 409A of the Code, payments may only be made under this Agreement upon an event and in a manner permitted by Section 409A of the Code.  Any payments or benefits that are provided upon a termination of employment shall, to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of a penalty tax on Executive under Section 409A of the Code, not be provided unless such termination constitutes a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  Any payments that qualify for the  short term deferral  exception or another exception under Section 409A of the Code shall be paid under the applicable exception.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is considered a  specified employee  (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), any amounts paid or provided under this Agreement shall, to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of a penalty tax on Executive under Section 409A of the Code, be delayed for six (6) months after Executive s  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and the accumulated amounts shall be paid in a lump sum within ten (10) calendar days after the end of the six (6)-month period. If Executive dies during the six (6)-month postponement period prior to the payment of benefits, the amounts the payment of which is deferred on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the personal representative of Executive s estate within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of Executive s death. 
  (b)  For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.  In no event may Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of a payment. All reimbursements and in kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where  
  
   24 

applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during the period of time specified in this Agreement, (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made no later than the last calendar day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

           1. 
    Release of Claims by Executive  . 
       
  (a)  Pursuant to Section 11(h) of the Employment Agreement, Executive, with the intention of binding himself and his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns (collectively, and together with Executive, the    Executive Releasors   ), hereby releases, remises, acquits and forever discharges the Company and each of its subsidiaries and affiliates (the    Company Affiliated Group   ), and their past and present directors, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants, representatives, plan fiduciaries, and the successors, predecessors and assigns of each of the foregoing (collectively, and together with the members of the Company Affiliated Group, the    Company Released Parties   ), of and from any and all claims, actions, causes of action, complaints, charges, demands, rights, damages, debts, sums of money, accounts, financial obligations, suits, expenses, attorneys  fees and liabilities of whatever kind or nature in law, equity or otherwise, whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated or otherwise and whether now known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, that arise out of, or relate in any way to, events occurring on or before the date hereof relating to Executive s employment or the termination of such employment (collectively,    Released Claims   ) and that Executive, individually or as a member of a class, now has, owns or holds, or has at any time heretofore had, owned or held, against any Company Released Party in any capacity, including any and all Released Claims (i) arising out of or in any way connected with Executive s service to any member of the Company Affiliated Group (or the predecessors thereof) in any capacity (including as an employee, officer or director), or the termination of such service in any such capacity, (ii) for severance or vacation benefits, unpaid wages, salary or incentive payments, (iii) for breach of contract, wrongful discharge, impairment of economic opportunity, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional harm or other tort, (iv) for any violation of applicable federal, state and local labor and employment laws (including all laws concerning unlawful and unfair labor and employment practices) and (v) for employment discrimination under any applicable federal, state or local statute, provision, order or regulation, and including, without limitation, any claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (   Title VII   ), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (   ADEA   ) and any similar or analogous state statute, excepting only that no claim in respect of any of the following rights shall constitute a Released Claim:

Executive waives any right he may have to benefit in any manner from any relief (whether monetary or otherwise) arising out of any Proceeding. 
    
  (c)  In the event any Proceeding within the scope of this Section 1 is brought by any government agency, putative class representative or other third Party to vindicate any alleged rights of Executive, (i) Executive shall, except to the extent required or compelled by law, legal process or subpoena, refrain from participating, testifying or producing documents therein, and (ii) all damages, inclusive of attorneys  fees, if any, required to be paid to Executive by the Company as a consequence of such Proceeding shall be repaid to the Company by Executive within ten (10) calendar days of his receipt thereof. 
    
  (d)  The amounts and other benefits set forth in Sections 11(b)(A)-(C) of the Employment Agreement, to which Executive would not otherwise be entitled, are being paid to Executive in return for Executive s execution and non-revocation of this Release and Executive s agreements and covenants contained in the Employment Agreement.  Executive acknowledges and agrees that the release of claims set forth in this Section 1 is not to be construed in any way as an admission of any liability whatsoever by any Company Released Party, any such liability being expressly denied. 
    
  (e)  The release of claims set forth in this Section 1 applies to any relief in respect of any Released Claim of any kind, no matter how called, including wages, back pay, front pay, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, punitive damages, damages for pain or suffering, costs, and attorney s fees and expenses.  Executive specifically acknowledges that his acceptance of the terms of the release of claims set forth in this Section 1 is, among other things, a specific waiver of his rights, claims and causes of action under Title VII, ADEA and any state or local law or regulation in respect of discrimination of any kind;   provided  ,   however  , that nothing herein shall be deemed, nor does anything contained herein purport, to be a waiver of any right or claim or cause of action which by law Executive is not permitted to waive.

Cause is based. If, within twenty (20) calendar days after such Cause Notice is given to Executive, the Board gives written notice to Executive confirming that, in the judgment of at least a majority of the members of the Board, Cause for terminating his employment on the basis set forth in the original Cause Notice exists, his employment hereunder shall thereupon be terminated for Cause, subject to de novo review, at Executive s election, through arbitration in accordance with Section 29.

In the  
  
   11 

case of Disability, if there is a period of time during which Executive is not being paid Annual Base Salary and not receiving long-term disability insurance payments, the Company shall (subject to Section 32(a)) make interim payments to Executive equal to such unpaid disability insurance payments until the commencement of disability insurance payments. 
    
  (g)  Benefits on Any Termination.    On any termination of Executive s employment hereunder, he shall be entitled to other or additional benefits in accordance with the then applicable terms of applicable plans, programs, corporate governance documents, agreements and arrangements of the Company and its affiliates (excluding any such plans, programs, corporate governance documents, agreements and arrangements of the Company and its affiliates providing for severance payments and/or benefits) (collectively,    Company Arrangements   ). 
    
  (h)  Conditions to Payments  .  Any and all amounts payable and benefits or additional rights provided pursuant to Sections 11(b)(A)-(C) shall be paid only if Executive signs and delivers to the Company and does not (within the applicable revocation period) revoke a general release of claims in favor of the Company, its affiliates, and their respective successors, assigns, officers, directors and representatives in substantially the form attached hereto as   Exhibit A   hereto (the    Release   ) within no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the Date of Termination. If Executive does not timely sign and deliver such Release to the Company, or if Executive timely revokes such Release, Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that he shall forfeit any and all right to any and all amounts payable and benefits or additional rights provided pursuant to Sections 11(b)(A)-(C). 
    
  (i)  Survival  .  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the respective rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall survive any termination of Executive s employment. 
  12.  Excess Parachute Payment  . 
  (a)  Anything in this Agreement or the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent that any payment, distribution or acceleration of vesting to or for the benefit of Executive by the Company (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder), whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (the    Total Payments   ), is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the    Excise Tax   ), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Safe Harbor Amount (as defined below) if and to the extent that a reduction in the Total Payments would result in Executive retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax), than if Executive received the entire amount of such Total Payments in accordance with their existing terms (taking into account federal, state, and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax). For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Safe Harbor Amount        means the largest portion of the Total Payments that would result in no portion of the Total Payments being subject to the Excise Tax. To effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Total Payments which are payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating non-cash payments, in  
  
   12 

each case, starting with the payments to be made farthest in time from the Determination (as defined below). 
    
  (b)  The determination of whether the Total Payments shall be reduced as provided in Section 12(a) and the amount of such reduction shall be made at the Company s expense by an accounting firm selected by Company from among the ten (10) largest accounting firms in the United States or by qualified independent tax counsel (the    Determining Party      provided   that Executive shall be given advance notice of the Determining Party selected by the Company, and shall have the opportunity to reject the selection, within two (2) business days of being notified of the selection, on the basis of that Determining Party s having a conflict of interest or other reasonable basis, in which case the Company shall select an alternative auditing firm among the ten largest accounting firms in the United States or alternative independent qualified tax counsel, which shall become the Determining Party.  Such Determining Party shall provide its determination (the    Determination   ), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and Executive, within ten (10) business days of the termination of Executive s employment or at such other time mutually agreed by the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive with respect to the Total Payments, it shall furnish Executive with an opinion reasonably acceptable to Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such payments and, absent manifest error, such Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. If the Determining Party determines that an Excise Tax would be payable, the Company shall have the right to accept the Determination as to the extent of the reduction, if any, pursuant to Section 12(a), or to have such Determination reviewed by another accounting firm selected by the Company, at the Company s expense. If the two accounting firms do not agree, a third accounting firm shall be jointly chosen by Executive and the Company, in which case the determination of such third accounting firm shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. 
    
  (c)  If, notwithstanding any reduction described in this Section 12, the Internal Revenue Service (   IRS   ) determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of any of the Total Payments or otherwise, then Executive shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within thirty (30) calendar days after a final IRS determination or in the event that Executive challenges the final IRS determination, a final judicial determination, a portion of the Total Payments equal to the  Repayment Amount.  The    Repayment Amount    with respect to the payment of benefits shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax and all other applicable taxes imposed on the Payment) shall be maximized. The Repayment Amount shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not result in Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments being maximized. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this Section 12(c), Executive shall pay the Excise Tax. 
    
  (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 12, if (i) there is a reduction in the Total Payments as described in this Section 12, (ii) the IRS later determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment of which would result in the maximization of Executive s net after-tax proceeds (calculated as if Executive s benefits had not previously been reduced), and (iii) Executive pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay to  
  
   13 

Executive those payments or benefits which were reduced pursuant to this Section 12 as soon as administratively possible after Executive pays the Excise Tax (but not later than March 15 following the calendar year of the IRS determination) so that Executive s net after-tax proceeds with respect to the Total Payments are maximized. 
    
  (e)  To the extent requested by Executive, the Company shall cooperate with Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Determining Party shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by Executive (including, without limitation, Executive s agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant, before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q A-2(b) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q A-9 and Q A-40 to Q A-44 of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code and/or exempt from the definition of the term  parachute payment  within the meaning of Q A-2(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q A-5(a) of the final regulations under Section 280G of the Code. 
  13.  Competition/Confidentiality  . 
    
  (a)  Acknowledgments by Executive  . Executive acknowledges that: (i) on and following the Employment Effective Date and through the Term and as a part of Executive s employment, Executive has been and will be afforded access to Confidential Information (as defined below); (ii) public disclosure of such Confidential Information could have an adverse effect on the Company and its business; (iii) because Executive possesses substantial technical expertise and skill with respect to the Company s business, the Company desires to obtain exclusive ownership of each invention by Executive while Executive is employed by the Company, and the Company will be at a substantial competitive disadvantage if it fails to acquire exclusive ownership of each such invention by Executive; and (iv) the provisions of this Section 13 are reasonable and necessary to prevent the improper use or disclosure of Confidential Information and to provide the Company with exclusive ownership of all inventions and works made or created by Executive. 
    
  (b)  Confidential Information  . 
    
  (i)  Executive acknowledges that on and following the Employment Effective Date and through the Term Executive has had and will have access to and may obtain, develop, or learn of Confidential Information (as defined below) under and pursuant to a relationship of trust and confidence.

  (ii)  As used in this Agreement, the term    Confidential Information        shall include, but not be limited to, any of the following information relating to the Company

           (F) 
    information concerning the Company s employees, officers, directors and shareholders; and 
       
           (G) 
    any other trade secret or information of a confidential or proprietary nature. 
       
  (iii)  Executive shall not make or use any notes or memoranda relating to any Confidential Information except for uses reasonably expected by Executive to be for the benefit of the Company, and will, at the Company s request, return each original and every copy of any and all notes, memoranda, correspondence, diagrams or other records, in written or other 
  
   15 

form, that Executive may at any time have within his possession or control that contain any Confidential Information. 
    
  (iv)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that has come within the public domain through no fault of or action by Executive or that has become rightfully available to Executive on a non-confidential basis from any third party, the disclosure of which to Executive does not violate any contractual or legal obligations that such third party has to the Company or its affiliates with respect to such Confidential Information. None of the foregoing obligations and restrictions applies to any part of the Confidential Information that Executive demonstrates was or became generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Executive or by any other person bound by a confidentiality obligation to the Company in respect of such Confidential Information. Further, nothing herein shall prohibit Executive from using Confidential Information to the extent necessary to exercise any legally protected whistleblower rights (including pursuant to Rule 21F under the Exchange Act). 
    
  (v)  Executive will not remove from the Company s premises (except to the extent such removal is for purposes of the performance of Executive s duties at home or while traveling, or except as otherwise specifically authorized by the Company) any Company document, record, notebook, plan, model, component, device, or computer software or code, whether embodied in a disk or in any other form (collectively, the    Proprietary Items   ).      Executive recognizes that, as between the Company and Executive, all of the Proprietary Items, whether or not developed by Executive, are the exclusive property of the Company. Upon termination of Executive s employment by either Party, or upon the request of the Company on and following the Effective Date and through the Term, Executive will return to the Company all of the Proprietary Items in Executive s possession or subject to Executive s control, including all equipment (  e.g.  , laptop computers, cell phone, portable e-mail devices, etc.), documents, files and data, and Executive shall not retain any copies, abstracts, sketches, or other physical embodiment of any such Proprietary Items. 
  14.  Proprietary Developments  . 
    
  (a)  Developments  .  Any and all inventions, products, discoveries, improvements, processes, methods, computer software programs, models, techniques, or formulae (collectively, hereinafter referred to as    Developments   ), made, conceived, developed, or created by Executive (alone or in conjunction with others, during regular work hours or otherwise) during Executive s employment which may be directly or indirectly useful in, or relate to, the business conducted or to be conducted by the Company will be promptly disclosed by Executive to the Company and shall be the Company s exclusive property. The term  Developments  shall not be deemed to include inventions, products, discoveries, improvements, processes, methods, computer software programs, models, techniques, or formulae which were in the possession of Executive prior to the Employment Effective Date. Executive hereby transfers and assigns to the Company all proprietary rights that Executive may have or acquire in any Developments and Executive waives any other special right which Executive may have or accrue therein. Executive will execute any documents and take any actions that may be required, in the reasonable determination of the Company s counsel, to effect and confirm such assignment, transfer and waiver, to direct the issuance of patents,  
  
   16 

trademarks, or copyrights to the Company with respect to such Developments as are to be the Company s exclusive property or to vest in the Company title to such Developments;   provided  ,     however  , that the expense of securing any patent, trademark or copyright shall be borne by Company.

  15.  Non-Competition and Non-Interference  . 
    
  (a)  Acknowledgments by Executive  .  Executive acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the services to be performed by Executive under this Agreement are of a special, unique, unusual, extraordinary, and intellectual character; (ii) the Company competes with other businesses that are or could be located in any part of the world; (iii) the provisions of this Section 15 are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company s business and lawful protectable interests, and do not impair Executive s ability to earn a living; and (iv) the Company has agreed to provide the severance and other benefits set forth in Sections 11(b)(A)-(C) in consideration for Executive s abiding by the obligations under this Section 15 and but for Executive s agreement to comply with such obligations, the Company would not have agreed to provide such severance and other benefits. 
    
  (b)  Covenants of Executive  .  For purposes of this Section 15, the term    Restricted Period    shall mean the period commencing on the Effective Date and terminating on the second anniversary (or, in the case of Section 15(b)(iii), the first anniversary) of the Date of Termination.  In consideration of the acknowledgments by Executive, and in consideration of the compensation and benefits to be paid or provided to Executive by the Company, Executive covenants and agrees that during the Restricted Period, Executive will not, directly or indirectly, for Executive s own benefit or for the benefit of any other person or entity other than the Company: 
  (i)  in the United States or any other country or territory where the Company then conducts its business: engage in, operate, finance, control or be employed by a  Competitive Business  (as defined below); serve as an officer or director of a Competitive Business (regardless of where Executive then lives or conducts such activities); perform any work as an employee, consultant (other than as a member of a professional consultancy, law firm, accounting firm or similar professional enterprise that has been retained by the Competitive Business and where Executive has no direct role in such professional consultancy and maintains the confidentiality of all information acquired by Executive during his or her employment with the Company), contractor, or in any other capacity with, a Competitive Business; directly or indirectly invest or own any interest in a Competitive Business (regardless of where Executive then lives or conducts such activities); or directly or indirectly provide any services or advice to any business, person or entity who or which is engaged in a Competitive Business (other than as 
  
   17 

a member of a professional consultancy, law firm, accounting firm or similar professional enterprise that has been retained by the Competitive Business and where Executive has no direct role in such professional consultancy and maintains the confidentiality of all information acquired by Executive during his or her employment with the Company).  A    Competitive Business    is any business, person or entity who or which, anywhere within that part of the United States, or that part of any other country or territory, where the Company conducts business (A) owns or operates a cable television system; (B) provides direct television or any satellite based, telephone system based, internet based or wireless system for delivering television, music or other entertainment programming (other than as an ancillary service, such as cellular telephone providers); (C) provides telephony services using any wired connection or fixed (as opposed to mobile) wireless application; (D) provides data or internet access services; (E) offers, provides, markets or sells any service or product of a type that is offered or marketed by or directly competitive with a service or product offered or marketed by the Company at the time Executive s employment terminates and, in the case of this clause (E), which produced greater than ten percent (10%) of the Company s revenues in the calendar year immediately prior to the year in which employment terminated; or (F) who or which in any case is preparing or planning to do any of the activities described in the preceding clauses (A) through (E). The provisions of this Section 15 shall not be construed or applied (I) so as to prohibit Executive from owning not more than five percent (5%) of any class of securities that is publicly traded on any national or regional securities exchange, as long as Executive s investment is passive and Executive does not lend or provide any services or advice to such business or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement in connection with such investment; or (II) so as to prohibit Executive from working as an employee in the cable television business for a company/business that owns or operates cable television franchises (by way of example as of the Effective Date only, Altice, Cox or Comcast),   provided   that the company/business is not providing cable services in any political subdivision/ geographic area where the Company has a franchise or provides cable services (other than nominal overlaps of service areas) and the company/business is otherwise not engaged in a Competitive Business, and   provided   that Executive does not otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement in connection with that work; and   provided     further   that nothing in this Section 15(b)(i) shall abrogate or affect any provision regarding the effect of Executive s working for a company/business that owns or operates cable television franchises (including, as of the Effective Date only, Altice, Cox and Comcast) in any stock option or other equity award agreement between Executive and the Company; 
    
  (ii)  contact, solicit or provide any service in connection with any Competitive Business to any person or entity that was a customer franchisee, or prospective customer of the Company at any time during Executive s employment (a prospective customer being one to whom the Company had made a business proposal within twelve (12) months prior to the time Executive s employment terminated); or directly solicit or encourage any customer, franchisee or subscriber of the Company to purchase any service or product of a type offered by or competitive with any product or service provided by the Company, or to reduce the amount or level of business purchased by such customer, franchisee or subscriber from the Company; or take away or procure for the benefit of any Competitive Business, any business of a type provided by or competitive with a product or service offered by the Company; or 
    
  (iii)  solicit or recruit for employment, or hire or attempt to hire, any person or persons who are employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or  
  
   18 

who were so employed at any time within a period of six (6) months immediately prior to the Date of Termination, or otherwise interfere with the relationship between any such person and the Company; nor will Executive assist anyone else in recruiting any such employee to work for another company or business or discuss with any such person his or her leaving the employ of the Company or engaging in a business activity in competition with the Company. This provision shall not apply to secretarial, clerical, custodial or maintenance employees, nor shall it prohibit Executive from providing a personal reference for the person or persons described in this subsection in response to a request for such a personal reference. 
  If Executive violates any covenant contained in this Section 15, then the term of the covenants in this Section shall be extended by the period of time Executive was in violation of the same. 
    
  (c)  Provisions Pertaining to the Covenants  .  Executive recognizes that the existing business of the Company extends to various locations and areas throughout the United States and will extend hereafter to other countries and territories and agrees that the scope of this Section 15 shall extend to any part of the United States, and any other country or territory, where the Company operates or conducts business, or has concrete plans to do so at the time Executive s employment terminates.  It is agreed that Executive s services hereunder are special, unique, unusual and extraordinary giving them peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated for by damages, and in the event of Executive s breach of this Section, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise in addition to the cessation of payments and benefits hereunder.  If any provision of Section 13, 14 or 15 is deemed to be unenforceable by a court (whether because of the subject matter of the provision, the duration of a restriction, the geographic or other scope of a restriction or otherwise), that provision shall not be rendered void but the Parties instead agree that the court shall amend and alter such provision to such lesser degree, time, scope, extent and/or territory as will grant the Company the maximum restriction on Executive s activities permitted by applicable law in such circumstances. The Company s failure to exercise its rights to enforce the provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected by the existence or non-existence of any other similar agreement for anyone else employed by the Company or by the Company s failure to exercise any of its rights under any such agreement. 
    
  (d)  Notices  .  In order to preserve the Company s rights under this Agreement, the Company is authorized to advise any potential or future employer, any third party with whom Executive may become employed or enter into any business or contractual relationship with, and any third party whom Executive may contact for any such purpose, of the existence of this Agreement and its terms, and the Company shall not be liable for doing so. 
    
  (e)  Injunctive Relief and Additional Remedy  .  Executive acknowledges that the injury that would be suffered by Company as a result of a breach of the provisions of this Agreement (including any provision of Sections 13, 14 and 15) would be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to the Company for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, the Company will have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce any provision of this Agreement, and the Company will not be obligated to post bond or other security in seeking such relief.  Without limiting the Company s rights under this Section or any other remedies of the Company, in the event of a determination by a court of competent 
  
   19 

jurisdiction, as to which no further appeal can be taken or as to which the time to appeal has expired, that Executive has willfully breached a material obligation under Section 13, 14 or 15, (i) the Company will have the right to cease making any payments otherwise due to Executive under this Agreement and (ii) Executive will repay to the Company all amounts paid to him under this Agreement on and following the date that such breach first occurred (as determined by the court), including but not limited to the return of any stock and options (and stock purchased through the exercise of options) that first became vested following such date, and the proceeds of the sale of any such stock.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive s breach of a material obligation under Section 13, 14 or 15 is curable, prior to seeking the remedies contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall provide Executive written notice of such breach and Executive shall be given ten (10) business days from receipt of such written notice to cure,   provided  , that if Executive cures such breach and then breaches again, no further opportunity to cure shall be provided. 
    
  (f)  Covenants of Sections 13, 14 and 15 are Essential and Independent Covenants  .  The covenants by Executive in Sections 13, 14 and 15 are essential elements of this Agreement, and without Executive s agreement to comply with such covenants, the Company would not have entered into this Agreement or employed Executive. The Company and Executive have independently consulted their respective counsel and have been advised in all respects concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants, with specific regard to the nature of the business conducted by the Company. Executive s covenants in Sections 13, 14 and 15 are independent covenants and the existence of any claim by Executive against the Company, under this Agreement or otherwise, will not excuse Executive s breach of any covenant in Section 13, 14 or 15. If Executive s employment hereunder is terminated, this Agreement will continue in full force and effect as is necessary or appropriate to enforce the covenants and agreements of Executive in Sections 13, 14 and 15. The Company s right to enforce the covenants in Sections 13, 14 and 15 shall not be adversely affected or limited by the Company s failure to have an agreement with another employee with provisions at least as restrictive as those contained in Section 13, 14 or 15, or by the Company s failure or inability to enforce (or agreement not to enforce) in full the provisions of any other or similar agreement containing one or more restrictions of the type specified in Sections 13, 14 and 15. 
  16.  Representations and Further Agreements  . 
    
  (a)  Executive represents, warrants and covenants to the Company that Executive is knowledgeable and sophisticated as to business matters, including the subject matter of this Agreement, and that prior to assenting to the terms of this Agreement, or giving the representations and warranties herein, Executive has been given a reasonable time to review it and has consulted with counsel of Executive s choice; and 
    
  (b)  During Executive s employment with the Company and subsequent to the cessation thereof, Executive will reasonably cooperate with Company, and furnish any and all complete and truthful information, testimony or affidavits in connection with any matter that arose during Executive s employment, that in any way relates to the business or operations of the Company or any of its parent or subsidiary corporations or affiliates, or of which Executive may have any knowledge or involvement; and will consult with and provide information to the Company and its representatives concerning such matters. Executive shall reasonably cooperate 
  
   20 

with the Company in the protection and enforcement of any intellectual property rights that relate to services performed by Executive for Company, whether under the terms of this Agreement or prior to the execution of this Agreement. This shall include without limitation executing, acknowledging, and delivering to the Company all documents or papers that may be necessary to enable the Company to publish or protect such intellectual property rights. Subsequent to the cessation of Executive s employment with the Company, the Parties will make their best efforts to have such cooperation performed at reasonable times and places and in a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with any other employment in which Executive may then be engaged. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as requiring Executive to provide any testimony, sworn statement or declaration that is not complete and truthful. If the Company requires Executive to travel outside the metropolitan area in the United States where Executive then resides to provide any testimony or otherwise provide any such assistance, then the Company will reimburse Executive for any reasonable, ordinary and necessary travel and lodging expenses incurred by Executive to do so;   provided   that Executive submits all documentation required under the Company s standard travel expense reimbursement policies and as otherwise may be required to satisfy any requirements under applicable tax laws for the Company to deduct those expenses. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as requiring Executive to provide any testimony or affidavit that is not complete and truthful. 
    
  (c)  The Company represents and warrants that (i) it is fully authorized by action of the Board (and of any other Person or body whose action is required) to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under it, (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by it does not violate any applicable law, regulation, order, judgment or decree or any agreement, arrangement, plan or corporate governance document to which it is a party or by which it is bound, and (iii) upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties, this Agreement shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally. 
    
  17.  Mutual Non-Disparagement  .  Neither the Company nor Executive shall make any oral or written statement about the other Party which is intended or reasonably likely to disparage the other Party, or otherwise degrade the other Party s reputation in the business or legal community or in the telecommunications industry. 
    
  18.  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  .  Executive agrees to comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the    FCPA   ), which provides generally that: under no circumstances will foreign officials, representatives, political parties or holders of public offices be offered, promised or paid any money, remuneration, things of value, or provided any other benefit, direct or indirect, in connection with obtaining or maintaining contracts or orders hereunder.  When any representative, employee, agent, or other individual or organization associated with Executive is required to perform any obligation related to or in connection with this Agreement, the substance of this section shall be imposed upon such person and included in any agreement between Executive and any such person.  A material violation by Executive of the provisions of  
  
   21 

the FCPA shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Company to terminate Executive s employment for Cause in accordance with Section 10(a)(iii). 
    
  19.  Purchases and Sales of the Company s Securities  .  Executive has read and agrees to comply in all respects with the Company s Policy Regarding the Purchase and Sale of the Company s Securities by Employees (the    Policy   ), as the Policy may be amended from time to time.  Specifically, and without limitation, Executive agrees that Executive shall not purchase or sell stock in the Company at any time (a) that Executive possesses material non-public information about the Company or any of its businesses; and (b) during any  Trading Blackout Period  as may be determined by the Company as set forth in the Policy from time to time. 
    
  21.  Withholding  . Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to be made by the Company hereunder to Executive or his estate or beneficiary shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any, relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the Company may reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant to applicable law or regulation, and other withholding amounts authorized by Executive. 
    
  22.  Notices  . Any written notice required by this Agreement will be deemed provided and delivered to the intended recipient when (a) delivered in person by hand; (b) on the date of transmission, if delivered by confirmed facsimile; (c) three (3) calendar days after being sent via U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested; or (d) the calendar day after being sent via overnight courier, in each case when such notice is properly addressed to the following address and with all postage and similar fees having been paid in advance:

  Either Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands and other communications to such Party shall be delivered personally or mailed by giving written notice to the other Party in the manner described above. 
    
  23.  Binding Effect  .  This Agreement shall be for the benefit of and binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, legal representatives, successors and, where applicable, assigns. 
    
  24.  Entire Agreement  .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to its specific subject matter and supersedes any prior oral and written communications, agreements and understandings among the Parties concerning the specific subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the Prior Employment Agreement.  This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered, waived or rescinded in any manner, except by written instrument signed by both of the Parties hereto that expressly refers to the provision  
  
   22 

of this Agreement that is being modified, amended, altered, waived or rescinded;   provided  ,     however  , that the waiver by either Party of a breach or compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not operate nor be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or compliance. 
    
  25.  Severability  .  In case any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by any court of competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected in accordance with the terms hereof to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall have no force and effect, but such holding shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement;   provided   that the provisions held illegal, invalid or unenforceable do not reflect or manifest a fundamental benefit bargained for by a Party hereto. 
    
  26.  Assignment  .  Without limitation of Executive s right to terminate for Good Reason under Section 10(a)(iv), this Agreement can be assigned by the Company only to a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company and which assumes all of the Company s obligations hereunder.  The duties and covenants of Executive under this Agreement, being personal, may not be assigned or delegated except that Executive may assign payments due hereunder to a trust established for the benefit of Executive s family or to Executive s estate or to any partnership or trust entered into by Executive and/or Executive s immediate family members (meaning Executive s spouse and lineal descendants).  This Agreement shall be binding in all respects on permissible assignees. 
    
  27.  Notification.    In order to preserve the Company s rights under this Agreement, the Company is authorized to advise any third party with whom Executive may become employed or enter into any business or contractual relationship with, or whom Executive may contact for any such purpose, of the existence of this Agreement and its terms, and the Company shall not be liable for doing so. 
    
  28.  Choice of Law/Jurisdiction  .  This Agreement is deemed to be accepted and entered into in Delaware.  Executive and the Company intend and hereby acknowledge that jurisdiction over disputes with regard to this Agreement, and over all aspects of the relationship between the Parties, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to its rules governing conflicts of laws.  With respect to orders in aid or enforcement of arbitration awards and injunctive relief, venue and jurisdiction are proper in any county in Delaware, and (if federal jurisdiction exists) any United States District Court in Delaware, and the Parties waive all objections to jurisdiction and venue in any such forum and any defense that such forum is not the most convenient forum. 
    
  29.  Arbitration  .  Any claim or dispute between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any other agreement between the Parties, Executive s employment with the Company, or any termination thereof (collectively,    Covered Claims   ) shall (except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 15(e) with respect to certain requests for injunctive relief) be resolved by binding confidential arbitration, to be held in Wilmington, Delaware, before a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with the National Rules for Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association and this Section 29. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Pending the resolution of any Covered Claim, Executive (and his beneficiaries) shall continue to receive all 
  
   23 

payments and benefits due under this Agreement or otherwise, except to the extent that the arbitrators otherwise provide. The Company shall reimburse Executive for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, legal, tax and accounting fees) incurred by him in any arbitration under this Section 29, to the extent he substantially prevails in any such arbitration. 
    
  30.  Section Headings  .  The section headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any manner the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 
    
  31.  Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  This Agreement may also be executed by delivery of facsimile or  .pdf  signatures, which shall be effective for all purposes. 
    
  32.  Section 409A Compliance  . 
  (a)  This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code or an exemption thereto, and, to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of a penalty tax on Executive under Section 409A of the Code, payments may only be made under this Agreement upon an event and in a manner permitted by Section 409A of the Code.  Any payments or benefits that are provided upon a termination of employment shall, to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of a penalty tax on Executive under Section 409A of the Code, not be provided unless such termination constitutes a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.  Any payments that qualify for the  short term deferral  exception or another exception under Section 409A of the Code shall be paid under the applicable exception.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is considered a  specified employee  (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), any amounts paid or provided under this Agreement shall, to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of a penalty tax on Executive under Section 409A of the Code, be delayed for six (6) months after Executive s  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and the accumulated amounts shall be paid in a lump sum within ten (10) calendar days after the end of the six (6)-month period. If Executive dies during the six (6)-month postponement period prior to the payment of benefits, the amounts the payment of which is deferred on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the personal representative of Executive s estate within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of Executive s death. 
  (b)  For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.  In no event may Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of a payment. All reimbursements and in kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during the period of time specified in this Agreement, (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made no later than the last calendar day of the 
  
   24 

calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

           1.

  (1)  any right arising under, or preserved by, this Release or the Employment Agreement; 
  
   A-  1 

(2)  for avoidance of doubt, any right to indemnification under (i) applicable corporate law, (ii) the by-laws or certificate of incorporation of any Company Released Party, (iii) any other agreement between Executive and a Company Released Party or (iv) as an insured under any director s and officer s liability insurance policy now or previously in force; or

Executive waives any right he may have to benefit in any manner from any relief (whether monetary or otherwise) arising out of any Proceeding. 
    
  (c)  In the event any Proceeding within the scope of this Section 1 is brought by any government agency, putative class representative or other third Party to vindicate any alleged rights of Executive, (i) Executive shall, except to the extent required or compelled by law, legal process or subpoena, refrain from participating, testifying or producing documents therein, and (ii) all damages, inclusive of attorneys  fees, if any, required to be paid to Executive by the Company as a consequence of such Proceeding shall be repaid to the Company by Executive within ten (10) calendar days of his receipt thereof.

Executive acknowledges and agrees that the release of claims set forth in this Section 1 is not to be construed in any way as an admission of any liability whatsoever by any Company Released Party, any such liability being expressly denied. 
    
  (e)  The release of claims set forth in this Section 1 applies to any relief in respect of any Released Claim of any kind, no matter how called, including wages, back pay, front pay, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, punitive damages, damages for pain or suffering, costs, and attorney s fees and expenses.

Notes to the Pro Forma Statements of Operations Adjustments 
    
  Refer to Exhibit 99.1 included in Charter's Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2016 for more detailed information regarding these adjustments. 
    
           (a) 
    Adjustments to revenues and operating costs and expenses reflect: 
                
    a reclassification to conform to Charter s financial statement classification for processing fees revenue, among other revenue items; and 
                
    eliminations of revenue/expense between Charter, TWC and Bright House including the TWC management fee incurred by Bright House.   
     Operating costs and expenses also include adjustments for: 
             
    incremental replacement stock award compensation expense for TWC employees; 
                
    elimination of amortization of actuarial gains (losses) and prior service credits for pension plans;  
                
    a Bright House adjustment to capitalize residential installation labor and other labor costs to conform to Charter s capitalization accounting policy; and 
                
    elimination of costs related to parent company obligations not assumed by Charter in the Bright House transactions; and 
                
    other reclassifications to conform to Charter s financial statement classification. 
       
           (b) 
    Adjustments to depreciation and amortization represent additional expense as a result of adjusting TWC and Bright House property, plant and equipment and customer relationships to fair value in accordance with acquisition accounting.  The pro forma adjustments are based on current estimates and may not reflect actual depreciation and amortization once the purchase price allocation is finalized and final determination of useful lives is made. 
       
           (c) 
    Adjustments to other operating (income) expenses, net reflect: 
                
    elimination of TWC stock compensation expense classified by TWC as merger-related in other operating expense; 
                
    elimination of Charter and TWC transaction costs directly related to the transactions; and 
                
    other reclassifications to conform to Charter s financial statement classification. 
       
           (d) 
    Adjustments to interest expense, net reflect: 
                
    additional interest expense on new debt issued and related amortization of deferred financing fees; 
                
    amortization of net premium as a result of adjusting assumed TWC long-term debt to fair value; 
                
    elimination of amortization related to TWC s previously deferred financing fees and debt discounts; 
                
    elimination of historical interest expense incurred by Bright House as debt is not assumed in the Bright House transactions. 
       
           (e) 
    The income tax benefit impact of the pro forma adjustments was determined by applying an estimated Charter tax rate of 39% to the pro forma loss before taxes of Charter following the Transactions, and, with respect to the Bright House Transaction, less the impact on the tax rate as a result of the noncontrolling interest allocation of the Charter Holdings partnership.  The three months ended June 30, 2016 also eliminates the reduction of the valuation allowance as the reduction was a direct result of the Transactions. 
       
           (f) 
    Adjustment to noncontrolling interest represents A/N s relative economic common ownership interest in Charter Holdings and Charter Holdings 6% cash dividend to preferred unit holders.

    Basic weighted average common shares outstanding were adjusted for the shares issued to TWC shareholders (including the Liberty Parties), shares purchased by the Liberty parties and a reduction of Charter shares outstanding as a result of applying the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio.  Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding is based on basic weighted average common shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of equity awards and Charter Holdings convertible preferred units and common units to the extent they were dilutive.
