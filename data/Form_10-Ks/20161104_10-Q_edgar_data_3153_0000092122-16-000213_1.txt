CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning regulated rates, the strategic goals for the wholesale business, economic conditions, fuel and environmental cost recovery and other rate actions, current and proposed environmental regulations and related compliance plans and estimated expenditures, pending or potential litigation matters, access to sources of capital, financing activities, completion dates of acquisitions and construction projects, filings with state and federal regulatory authorities, federal income tax benefits, estimated sales and purchases under power sale and purchase agreements, and estimated construction and other plans and expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "projects," "predicts," "potential," or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other similar terminology. There are various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These factors include: 

the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory changes, including legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the utility industry, environmental laws regulating emissions, discharges, and disposal to air, water, and land, and also changes in tax and other laws and regulations to which Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and regulations; 
                
    current and future litigation, regulatory investigations, proceedings, or inquiries, including, without limitation, IRS and state tax audits; 
                
    the effects, extent, and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets in which Southern Company's subsidiaries operate; 
                
    variations in demand for electricity and natural gas, including those relating to weather, the general economy and recovery from the last recession, population and business growth (and declines), the effects of energy conservation and efficiency measures, including from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self-generation and distributed generation technologies, and any potential economic impacts resulting from federal fiscal decisions; 
                
    available sources and costs of natural gas and other fuels; 
                
    limits on pipeline capacity; 
                
    effects of inflation; 
                
    the ability to control costs and avoid cost overruns during the development and construction of facilities, which include the development and construction of generating facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed, including changes in labor costs and productivity, adverse weather conditions, shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor, sustaining nitrogen supply, contractor or supplier delay, non-performance under construction, operating, or other agreements, operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs, unforeseen engineering or design problems, start-up activities (including major equipment failure and system integration), and/or operational performance (including additional costs to satisfy any operational parameters ultimately adopted by any PSC); 
                
    the ability to construct facilities in accordance with the requirements of permits and licenses, to satisfy any environmental performance standards and the requirements of tax credits and other incentives, and to integrate facilities into the Southern Company system upon completion of construction; 
                
    investment performance of Southern Company's employee and retiree benefit plans and the Southern Company system's nuclear decommissioning trust funds; 
                
    advances in technology;

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THIRD QUARTER 2016 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2015 
  AND 
  YEAR-TO-DATE 2016 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2015 

OVERVIEW 
  Southern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of the traditional electric operating companies and the parent entities of Southern Power and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. Discussion of the results of operations is focused on the Southern Company system's primary business of electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and, following the closing of the Merger on July 1, 2016, the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas, formerly known as AGL Resources Inc. The four traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in four Southeastern states. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through seven natural gas distribution utilities and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas marketing services, wholesale gas services, and gas midstream operations. Southern Company's other business activities include providing products and services in the areas of distributed generation, energy efficiency, and utility infrastructure, as well as investments in telecommunications and leveraged lease projects. For additional information, see BUSINESS   "The Southern Company System   Traditional Operating Companies," "   Southern Power," and "   Other Businesses" in Item 1 of the Form 10-K. 
  Merger with Southern Company Gas 
  On July 1, 2016, Southern Company completed the Merger for a total purchase price of approximately   $8.0 billion   and Southern Company Gas became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Southern Company. 
  Prior to the completion of the Merger, Southern Company and Southern Company Gas operated as separate companies. The discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition set forth herein include Southern Company Gas' results of operations since July 1, 2016 and financial condition as of September 30, 2016. See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Company       Merger with Southern Company Gas  " herein for additional information regarding the Merger. 
  During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Southern Company recorded in its statements of income costs associated with the Merger of approximately   $40.8 million   and   $104.1 million  , respectively, of which   $40.6 million   and   $73.5 million   is included in operating expenses and   $0.2 million   and   $30.6 million   is included in other income and (expense), respectively. These costs include external transaction costs for financing, legal, and consulting services, as well as rate credits and additional compensation-related expenses. 
  See RISK FACTORS in Item 1A herein for additional information related to the various risks related to the Merger. 
  Construction Program 
  Construction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (45.7% ownership interest by Georgia Power in the two units, each with approximately 1,100 MWs) and Mississippi Power's 582-MW Kemper IGCC. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   "  Estimated Loss on Kemper IGCC  ," FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Construction Program  ," and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Georgia Power       Nuclear Construction  " and "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information. For information about Southern Power's acquisitions and construction of renewable energy facilities, see Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Power  " herein.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Key Performance Indicators 
  Southern Company continues to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, execution of major construction projects, and earnings per share. For additional information on these indicators, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OVERVIEW   "Key Performance Indicators" of Southern Company in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net Income 

Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was   $1.1 billion   (  $1.17   per share) for the   third quarter 2016   compared to   $959 million   (  $1.05   per share) for the   third quarter 2015  . The increase was primarily the result of an increase in retail electric revenues resulting from warmer weather and base rate increases, a decrease in income taxes primarily from income tax benefits at Southern Power, and lower charges related to revisions of the estimated costs expected to be incurred on Mississippi Power's construction of the Kemper IGCC, partially offset by increases in interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information. 
  Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was   $2.2 billion   (  $2.37   per share) for   year-to-date 2016   compared to   $2.1 billion   (  $2.30   per share) for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily the result of an increase in retail electric revenues resulting from base rate increases as well as the   2015   correction of a Georgia Power billing error and a decrease in income taxes primarily from income tax benefits at Southern Power, partially offset by increases in interest expense and depreciation and amortization. 
  Although several individual income statement line items reflect variances resulting from the Merger on July 1, 2016 and the acquisition of PowerSecure International, Inc. (PowerSecure) on May 9, 2016, consolidated net income for the third quarter and year-to-date 2016 was not significantly impacted by these transactions. 
  See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Company  " herein for additional information on the Merger and the acquisition of PowerSecure. 
  Retail Electric Revenues 

In the third quarter 2016  , retail electric revenues were   $4.8 billion     compared to   $4.7 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , retail electric revenues decreased slightly compared to the corresponding period in   2015  .

     Table of Contents  
  SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Details of the changes in retail electric revenues were as follows: 

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the   third quarter and year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily due to increases in base tariffs at Georgia Power under the 2013 ARP and the NCCR tariff and increased revenues at Alabama Power under Rate CNP Compliance, all effective January 1, 2016. Also contributing to the increase in rates and pricing for year-to-date 2016 was the 2015 correction of a Georgia Power billing error to a small number of large commercial and industrial customers and the implementation of rates at Mississippi Power for certain Kemper IGCC in-service assets, effective September 2015. 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Alabama Power," "Retail Regulatory Matters       Georgia Power       Rate Plans" and "   Nuclear Construction," and "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle   Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information. 
  Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in the   third quarter 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . Industrial KWH sales decreased 3.3% in the   third quarter 2016   primarily in the primary metals, paper, chemicals, pipelines, and stone, clay, and glass sectors. A strong dollar, low oil prices, and weak global economic conditions have constrained growth in the industrial sector. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 0.7% in the   third quarter 2016   primarily due to decreased customer usage resulting from an increase in energy saving initiatives, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 0.4% in the   third quarter 2016   primarily due to decreased customer usage primarily resulting from an increase in multi-family housing and efficiency improvements in residential appliances and lighting, partially offset by customer growth. 
  Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased for   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . Industrial KWH sales decreased 2.1% for   year-to-date 2016   primarily in the primary metals, chemicals, pipelines, and stone, clay, and glass sectors. A strong dollar, low oil prices, and weak global economic conditions have constrained growth in the industrial sector. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 0.6% for   year-to-date 2016   primarily due to decreased customer usage resulting from an increase in energy saving initiatives, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased 0.2% for   year-to-date 2016   due to customer growth, partially offset by decreased customer usage primarily resulting from an increase in multi-family housing and efficiency improvements in residential appliances and lighting. 
  In the first quarter 2015, Mississippi Power updated the methodology to estimate the unbilled revenue allocation among customer classes. This change did not have a significant impact on net income. The KWH sales variances discussed above reflect an adjustment to the estimated allocation of Mississippi Power's unbilled first quarter 2015 KWH sales among customer classes that is consistent with the actual allocation in 2016. Without this adjustment, year-to-date 2016 weather-adjusted residential sales increased 0.3%, weather-adjusted commercial sales decreased 0.5%, and industrial KWH sales decreased 2.0% as compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . 
  Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased   $128 million   and   $473 million   in the   third quarter and year-to-date 2016  , respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily due to a decrease in fuel prices. Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include     provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  
  SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, includi  ng the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs. 
  Wholesale Electric Revenues 

Wholesale electric revenues consist of PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated municipal and rural association sales as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy. 
  In the third quarter 2016  , wholesale electric revenues were   $613 million   compared to   $520 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . This increase was primarily related to a $121 million increase in energy revenues, partially offset by a $28 million decrease in capacity revenues. For   year-to-date 2016  , wholesale electric revenues were   $1.46 billion   compared to   $1.44 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . This increase was primarily related to a $112 million increase in energy revenues, partially offset by a $92 million decrease in capacity revenues. The increases in energy revenues were primarily due to an increase in short-term sales and renewable energy sales at Southern Power, partially offset by lower fuel prices. The decreases in capacity revenues were primarily due to the elimination in consolidation of a Southern Power PPA that was remarketed from a third party to Georgia Power in January 2016, the expiration of Plant Scherer Unit 3 power sales agreements at Gulf Power, and the expiration of wholesale contracts at Georgia Power, partially offset by an increase due to a new wholesale contract at Alabama Power. Additionally, the year-to-date 2016 decrease in capacity revenues was due to unit retirements at Georgia Power. 
  See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Regulatory Matters       Gulf Power  " herein for additional information regarding the expiration of long-term sales agreements at Gulf Power for Plant Scherer Unit 3, which will impact future wholesale earnings, and Gulf Power's request to rededicate its ownership interest in Scherer Unit 3 to the retail jurisdiction. 
  Other Electric Revenues 

For   year-to-date 2016  , other electric revenues were   $529 million   compared to   $494 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to increases in customer temporary facilities services revenues, outdoor lighting revenues, and solar application fee revenues at Georgia Power.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Natural Gas Revenues 
  Natural gas revenues represent sales from the seven natural gas distribution utilities and certain non-regulated operations of Southern Company Gas. Following the Merger,   $518 million   of natural gas revenues are included in the consolidated statements of income for the third quarter and year-to-date 2016. 
  See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Company       Merger with Southern Company Gas  " herein for additional information. 
  Other Revenues 

N/M - Not meaningful 
  In the third quarter 2016  , other revenues were   $144 million   compared to   $11 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , other revenues were   $281 million   compared to   $34 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . These increases were primarily due to $91 million and $150 million for the third quarter and year-to-date 2016, respectively, of revenues from products and services at PowerSecure, which was acquired on May 9, 2016, and $25 million of revenues from gas marketing products and services at Southern Company Gas following the Merger. Additionally, for the   third quarter and year-to-date 2016  , revenues from certain non-regulated sales of products and services by the traditional electric operating companies of $17 million and $63 million, respectively, were reclassified as other revenues for consistency of presentation on a consolidated basis. In prior periods, these revenues were included in other income (expense), net. 
  See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Company  " herein for additional information on the Merger and the acquisition of PowerSecure. 
  Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 

In the third quarter 2016  , total fuel and purchased power expenses were   $1.6 billion   compared to   $1.7 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily the result of a $209 million decrease in the average cost of fuel and purchased power primarily due to lower coal prices, partially offset by a $123 million increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , total fuel and purchased power expenses were   $3.9 billion   compared to   $4.4 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily the result of a $573 million decrease in the average cost of fuel and purchased power primarily due to lower coal and natural gas prices, partially offset by a $49 million net increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased. 
  Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Regulatory Matters       Fuel Cost Recovery  " herein for additional information. Fuel expenses incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.

Details of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows: 

(*) 
    Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider. 
     Fuel 
  In the third quarter 2016  , fuel expense was   $1.4 billion   compared to   $1.5 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a 23.1% decrease in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, partially offset by an 8.7% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , fuel expense was   $3.3 billion   compared to   $3.9 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a 15.1% decrease in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, an 11.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and an 11.8% decrease in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, partially offset by a 6.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas. 
  Purchased Power 
  In the third quarter 2016  , purchased power expense was   $227 million   compared to   $193 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a 24.1% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased, partially offset by a 6.4% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased, primarily as a result of lower fuel prices. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , purchased power expense was   $581 million   compared to   $507 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a 29.4% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased, partially offset by a 13.4% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased, primarily as a result of lower fuel prices. 
  Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized 

In the third quarter 2016  , interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was   $374 million   compared to   $218 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was   $913 million   compared to   $612 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . These increases were primarily due to an increase in average outstanding long-term debt primarily related to the financing of the Merger. In addition, following the Merger, $39 million in interest expense of Southern Company Gas is included in the consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and year-to-date 2016. Also contributing to the year-to-date 2016 increase was the May 2015 termination of an asset purchase agreement between Mississippi Power and SMEPA and the resulting reversal of accrued interest on related deposits. 
  See Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information. 
  Other Income (Expense), Net   

  N/M - Not meaningful 
  In the third quarter 2016  , other income (expense), net was   $21 million   compared to   $(21) million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , other income (expense), net was   $(38) million   compared to   $(41) million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . Following the Merger, $38 million in other income of Southern Company Gas is included in the consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and year-to-date 2016, primarily related to $27 million of earnings from the equity method investment in Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (SNG) in September 2016. Additionally, in the third quarter 2016, revenues and costs associated with certain non-regulated sales of products and services by the traditional electric operating companies were reclassified to other revenues and cost of other sales for consistency of presentation on a consolidated basis following the PowerSecure acquisition. For the   third quarter and year-to-date 2016  , net amounts reclassified were $6 million and $20 million, respectively. The year-to-date 2016 increase was partially offset by fees associated with the Bridge Agreement for the Merger. 
  See "  Other Revenues  " and "  Cost of Other Sales  " herein and Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Company  " herein for additional information. Also see Note 12 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Southern Company   Merger Financing" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Income Taxes   

  In the third quarter 2016  , income taxes were   $448 million   compared to   $500 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to increased federal income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs at Southern Power, partially offset by a reduction in tax benefits related to the estimated probable losses on Mississippi Power's construction of the Kemper IGCC and an increase in pre-tax earnings. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , income taxes were   $942 million   compared to   $1.1 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to increased federal income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs at Southern

  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 
  The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of Southern Company's future earnings potential. The level of Southern Company's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Southern Company system's primary business of selling electricity and, as a result of closing the Merger, the distribution of natural gas. These factors include the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Company Gas' ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that allows for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs and the completion and subsequent operation of the Kemper IGCC and Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as well as other ongoing construction projects. Other major factors include the profitability of Southern Power's competitive wholesale business and successful additional investments in renewable and other energy projects. Future earnings for the electricity and natural gas businesses in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining and growing sales and customers which are subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the prices of electricity and natural gas, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the service territory. In addition, the level of future earnings for the wholesale electric business also depends on numerous factors including regulatory matters, creditworthiness of customers, total generating capacity available and related costs, future acquisitions and construction of generating facilities, the impact of tax credits from renewable energy projects, and the successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire. Demand for electricity and natural gas is primarily driven by economic growth. The pace of economic growth and electricity and natural gas     demand may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. 
  Volatility of natural gas prices has a significant impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services and wholesale gas services businesses to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability. 
  As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of certain assets, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. 
  On July 10, 2016, Southern Company and Kinder Morgan, Inc. (Kinder Morgan) entered into a definitive agreement for Southern Company to acquire a   50%   equity interest in SNG, which is the owner of a   7,000  -mile pipeline system connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. In addition, the agreement committed Southern Company and Kinder Morgan to cooperatively pursue specific growth opportunities to develop natural gas infrastructure through SNG. O  n August 31, 2016, Southern Company assigned its rights and obligations   under the definitive agreement to a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Southern Company Gas. On September 1, 2016, Southern Company Gas completed the acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion  . The investment in SNG is accounted for using the equity method.

Environmental Matters 
  Compliance costs related to federal and state environmental statutes and regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis or through market-based contracts. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are completed. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company in Item 7 and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Environmental Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

  Air Quality 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Environmental Matters       Environmental Statutes and Regulations       Air Quality" of   Southern Company   in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the EPA's final MATS rule, regional haze regulations,   fine particulate matter National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS),   and the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). 
  On April 25, 2016, in response to a June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court opinion, the EPA published its supplemental finding regarding consideration of costs in support of the MATS rule. This finding does not impact MATS rule compliance requirements, costs, or deadlines, and   all units within the Southern Company system   that are subject to the MATS rule completed the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the MATS rule by the applicable deadlines. 
  Also on April 25, 2016, the EPA issued proposed revisions to the regional haze regulations. The ultimate impact of the proposed revisions will depend on their ultimate adoption, implementation, and any legal challenges and cannot be determined at this time. 
  On   September 6, 2016, the EPA designated all remaining areas within   Georgia Power's and Gulf Power's   service territories     as attainment for the 2012 annual fine particulate matter NAAQS.   Following the EPA's decision, all areas within the traditional electric operating companies' service territory have now been designated as attainment for the 2012 fine particulate matter NAAQS. 
  On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates the CSAPR ozone season nitrogen oxide program, including revising ozone-season emissions budgets in   Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas and removing Florida and North Carolina from the program  . The ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of any legal challenges and implementation at the state level and cannot be determined at this time. 
  Coal Combustion Residuals 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Environmental Matters       Environmental Statutes and Regulations       Coal Combustion Residuals" of Southern Company in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the EPA's regulation of CCR. 
  On June 13, 2016, Georgia Power announced that all of its 29 ash ponds will cease operations and stop receiving coal ash in the next three years, and all ponds will eventually be closed either by removal, consolidation, and/or recycling for the beneficial use of coal ash or through closure in place using advanced engineering methods. On October 26, 2016, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources approved amendments to its state solid waste regulations to incorporate the requirements of the EPA's Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities Rule (CCR Rule) and establish additional requirements for all of Georgia Power's onsite storage units consisting of landfills and surface impoundments. The final State of Georgia regulations are not anticipated to have a material impact on   the Southern Company system's   compliance obligations under the CCR Rule.   See Note (A) to

  Fuel Cost Recovery 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Retail Regulatory Matters       Retail Fuel Cost Recovery" of Southern Company in Item 7 and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Alabama Power   Rate ECR" and "Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Fuel Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding retail fuel cost recovery. 
  The traditional electric operating companies each have established fuel cost recovery rates approved by their respective state PSCs. Fuel cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's revenues or net income, but will affect cash flow. The traditional electric operating companies continuously monitor their under or over recovered fuel cost balances and make appropriate filings with their state PSCs to adjust fuel cost recovery rates as necessary. 
  On May 17, 2016, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to decrease fuel rates by 15% effective June 1, 2016, which will reduce annual billings by approximately $313 million. Georgia Power is currently scheduled to file its next fuel case by February 28, 2017. 
  Renewables 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Retail Regulatory Matters       Renewables" of Southern Company in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Southern Company system's renewables activity. 
  In accordance with the Alabama PSC order approving up to 500 MWs of renewable projects, Alabama Power has entered into agreements to purchase power from or to build renewable generation sources, including a 72-MW solar PPA approved by the Alabama PSC in June 2016. Alabama Power is marketing the associated renewable energy credits (REC) generated by this solar PPA to customers interested in supporting renewable energy development. The terms of the renewable agreements permit Alabama Power to use the energy and retire the associated RECs in service of its customers or to sell RECs, separately or bundled with energy. 
  As part of the Georgia Power Advanced Solar Initiative (ASI), four PPAs totaling 149 MWs of Georgia Power's solar contracted capacity from Southern Power began in the first quarter 2016. During the second quarter 2016, Georgia Power executed PPAs to purchase an additional 41 MWs of solar capacity under the ASI. Ownership of any associated RECs is specified in each respective PPA. The party that owns the RECs retains the right to use them. 
  O  n October 4, 2016, two 30-MW solar generating facilities at Fort Gordon and Fort Stewart Army bases began commercial operation. These solar generating facilities were approved by the Georgia PSC in 2014  .

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Gulf Power 
  Through 2015, long-term non-affiliate capacity sales from Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (205 MWs) provided the majority of Gulf Power's wholesale earnings. The revenues from wholesale contracts covering 100% of this capacity represented 82% of Gulf Power's wholesale capacity revenues in 2015. Following contract expirations at the end of 2015 and the end of May 2016, Gulf Power's remaining contracted sales from the unit cover approximately 24% of Gulf Power's ownership of the unit through 2019. The expiration of these contracts is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings. On May 5, 2016, Gulf Power delivered a letter to the Florida PSC requesting recognition of Gulf Power's ownership in Plant Scherer Unit 3 as being in service to retail customers when and as its existing wholesale contracts expire. As a result, o  n September 13, 2016, the Florida PSC instructed Gulf Power to file its monthly earnings surveillance reports both including and excluding its share of investment and expenses related to Plant Scherer Unit 3 that is not covered by contracts  . 
  O  n October 12, 2016, Gulf Power filed a petition (2016 Rate Case) with the Florida PSC requesting an increase in retail rates and charges of $106.8 million based on the projected test year of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and a retail ROE of 11% compared to the current retail ROE of 10.25%. The recoverability of the costs associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 will be decided in this matter. The Florida PSC is expected to make a decision on the 2016 Rate Case in the second quarter 2017. Gulf Power has requested that the increase in base rates, if approved by the Florida PSC, become effective in July 2017  . 
  On November 2, 2016, the Florida PSC approved Gulf Power's annual rate clause request for its cost recovery clause factors for 2017. The fuel and environmental factors include certain costs associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Retail Regulatory Matters         Gulf Power         Cost Recovery Clauses  " herein for additional information. 
  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Southern Company Gas 
  Natural Gas Cost Recovery 
  Southern Company Gas has established natural gas cost recovery rates approved by the relevant state regulatory agencies in the states in which it serves. Natural gas cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable natural gas costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's revenues or net income, but will affect cash flow. 
  Regulatory Infrastructure Programs 
  Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are involved in ongoing capital projects associated with infrastructure improvement programs that have been previously approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies and provide an appropriate return on invested capital. These infrastructure improvement programs update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the utilities to improve safety and reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. Southern Company Gas currently has approved infrastructure improvement programs in   six   different states with initial program lengths ranging from four to   10 years  , with the longest set to expire in 2025. The average annual spend under these programs ranges from   $10 million   to   $250 million  . 
  Southern Company Gas currently has proposed infrastructure improvement programs pending approval by the applicable state regulatory agencies in Georgia and New Jersey requesting average annual spending of $44 million through 2020 and $110 million through 2027, respectively. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, as well as adding or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, adding environmental control equipment, expanding the electric transmission and distribution systems, and updating and expanding the natural gas distribution systems. For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. While Southern Power generally constructs and acquires generation assets covered by long-term PPAs, any uncontracted capacity could negatively affect future earnings. Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure programs that update or expand its natural gas distribution systems to improve reliability and ensure the safety of its utility infrastructure and recovers in rates its investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs. 
  The two largest construction projects currently underway in the Southern Company system are Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (45.7% ownership interest by Georgia Power in the two units, each with approximately 1,100 MWs) and Mississippi Power's 582-MW Kemper IGCC. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Nuclear Construction" and "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Retail Regulatory Matters         Georgia Power         Nuclear Construction  " and "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information. For additional information about costs relating to Southern Power's acquisitions that involve construction of renewable energy facilities, see Note 12 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Southern Power   Construction Projects" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Power       Construction Projects  " herein.

  Also see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations  " herein for additional information regarding Southern Company's capital requirements for its subsidiaries' construction programs. 
  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle 
  Mississippi Power's current cost estimate for the Kemper IGCC in total is approximately   $6.82 billion  , which includes approximately   $5.52 billion   of costs subject to the construction cost cap and is net of $137 million in additional DOE grants Mississippi Power received for the Kemper IGCC on April 8, 2016 (Additional DOE Grants), which are expected to be used to reduce future rate impacts for customers. Mississippi Power does not intend to seek any rate recovery for any related costs that exceed the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. In the aggregate, Southern Company has incurred charges of   $2.63 billion   (  $1.63 billion   after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through   September 30, 2016  . Mississippi Power's current cost estimate includes costs through December 31, 2016.  
  The initial production of syngas began on July 14, 2016 for gasifier "B" and on September 13, 2016 for gasifier "A." On October 11, 2016, the Kemper IGCC began testing using clean syngas from gasifier "A" and the related gas clean-up systems to produce electricity. On November 2, 2016, Mississippi Power determined a maintenance outage of gasifier "A" is needed to make improvements to the ash removal systems. The remaining schedule reflects the time expected to achieve production of electricity using gasifier "B," complete gasifier "A" outage activities, and resume electricity production using gasifier "A," as well as to complete the integration of all systems necessary for both combustion turbines to simultaneously generate electricity with syngas. 
  In subsequent periods, any further changes in the estimated costs of the Kemper IGCC subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions, will be reflected in Southern Company's statements of income and these changes could be material. 
  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Litigation 
  On April 26, 2016, a complaint against Mississippi Power was filed in Harrison County Circuit Court (Circuit Court) by Biloxi Freezing   Processing Inc., Gulfside Casino Partnership, and John Carlton Dean, which was amended and refiled on July 11, 2016 to include, among other things, Southern Company as a defendant. On August 12, 2016, Southern Company and Mississippi Power removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, where the case is currently pending. However, the plaintiffs have filed a request to remand the case back to state court. The individual plaintiff, John Carlton Dean, alleges that Mississippi Power and Southern Company violated the Mississippi Unfair Trade Practices Act. All plaintiffs have alleged that Mississippi Power and Southern Company concealed, falsely represented, and failed to fully disclose important facts concerning the cost and schedule of the Kemper IGCC and that these alleged breaches have unjustly enriched Mississippi Power and Southern Company. The plaintiffs seek unspecified actual damages and punitive damages; ask the Circuit Court to appoint a receiver to oversee, operate, manage, and otherwise control all affairs relating to the Kemper IGCC; ask the Circuit Court to revoke any licenses or certificates authorizing Mississippi Power or Southern Company to engage in any business related to the Kemper IGCC in Mississippi; and seek attorney's fees, costs, and interest. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prevent any Kemper IGCC costs from being charged to customers through electric rates. 
  On June 9, 2016, Treetop Midstream Services, LLC (Treetop) and other related parties filed a complaint against Mississippi Power, Southern Company, and SCS in the state court in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The complaint relates to the cancelled CO   2    contract with Treetop and alleges fraudulent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, civil conspiracy, and breach of contract on the part of Mississippi Power, Southern Company, and SCS and seeks compensatory damages of $100 million, as well as unspecified punitive damages. Southern Company, Mississippi Power, and SCS have moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the terms of the CO   2    contract. 
  Southern Company believes these legal challenges have no merit; however, an adverse outcome in these proceedings could have an impact on Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Southern Company will vigorously defend itself in these matters, and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Nuclear Construction 
  On October 20, 2016, Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC Staff entered into a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving the following prudence and cost recovery matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the   $3.3 billion   of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth Vogtle Construction Monitoring report will be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the definitive settlement agreement entered into on December 31, 2015 by Westinghouse and the Vogtle Owners (Contractor Settlement Agreement) is reasonable and prudent and none of the amounts paid or to be paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) financing costs on verified and approved capital costs will be deemed prudent provided they are incurred prior to December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively; and (iv) (a) the in-service capital cost forecast will be adjusted to   $5.680 billion   (Revised Forecast), which includes a contingency of   $240 million   above Georgia Power's current forecast of   $5.440 billion  , (b) capital costs incurred up to the Revised Forecast will be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, and (c) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above the Revised Forecast are reasonable and prudent. Under the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, the certified in-service capital cost for purposes of calculating the NCCR tariff will remain at   $4.418 billion  . Construction capital costs above   $4.418 billion   will accrue AFUDC through commercial operation. The ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be reduced from   10.95%   (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013 ARP) to   10.00%   effective January 1, 2016. For purposes of the AFUDC calculation, the ROE on costs between   $4.418 billion   and   $5.440 billion   will also be   10.00%   and the ROE on any amounts above   $5.440 billion   would be Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt. If the Georgia PSC adjusts Georgia Power's ROE rate setting point in a rate case prior to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 being placed into retail rate base, then the ROE for purposes of calculating both  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  
  SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

the NCCR tariff and AFUDC will likewise be 95 basis points lower than the revised ROE rate setting point. If Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by December 31, 2020, then (i) the ROE for purposes of calculating the NCCR tariff will be reduced an additional 300 basis points, and may, at the Georgia PSC's discretion, be accrued to be used for the benefit of customers, until such time as the units reach commercial operation and (ii) the ROE used to calculate AFUDC will be Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt. 
  Under the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will be placed into retail rate base on December 31, 2020 or upon reaching commercial operation, whichever is later. The Georgia PSC will determine for retail ratemaking purposes the process of transitioning Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from a construction project to an operating plant   no   later than Georgia Power's base rate case required to be filed by July 1, 2019. 
  The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement is subject to approval by the Georgia PSC, which is scheduled to vote on this matter on December 20, 2016. Accordingly, the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement are subject to change and the terms of any final agreement approved by the Georgia PSC may differ materially from the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. If approved, the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement is expected to reduce Georgia Power's revenues for the years 2016 through 2020 by a total of approximately   $325 million   (  $115 million   reduction in net income).

  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Income Tax Matters 
  Bonus Depreciation 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Income Tax Matters   Bonus Depreciation" of Southern Company in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  T  he extension of 50% bonus depreciation included in the PATH Act is expected to result in approximately $1.7 billion of positive cash flows for the 2016 tax year, which may not all be realized in 2016 due to a projected consolidated net operating loss for Southern Company. Approximately $370 million of the benefit is dependent upon placing the remainder of the Kemper IGCC in service by December 31, 2016  . See Note (B) to     the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " and Note (G) to     the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Current and Deferred Income Taxes       Net Operating Loss  " herein for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Other Matters 
  Southern Company and its subsidiaries are   involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition,   Southern Company and its subsidiaries are   subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.   The   business activities   of Southern Company's subsidiaries   are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as regulation of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, such as air quality and water standards, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO   2    and other emissions  , CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. 
  The     ultimate     outcome     of     such     pending     or     potential     litigation     against     Southern     Company     and     its     subsidiaries     cannot     be     predicted     at     this     time;     however,     for     current     proceedings     not     specifically     reported     in     Note     (B)     to     the     Condensed     Financial     Statements     herein     or     in     Note     3     to     the     financial     statements     of     Southern     Company     in     Item     8     of     the Form 10-K,     management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on   Southern Company's   financial statements.

Statements herein for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential. 
  The SEC is conducting a formal investigation of Southern Company and Mississippi Power concerning the estimated costs and expected in-service date of the Kemper IGCC. Southern Company and Mississippi Power believe the investigation is focused primarily on periods subsequent to 2010 and on accounting matters, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting associated with the Kemper IGCC. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES   "  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  " herein for additional information on the Kemper IGCC estimated construction costs and expected in-service date. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of Southern Company. 
  ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Southern Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Southern Company's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   ACCOUNTING POLICIES   "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of Southern Company in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a complete discussion of Southern Company's critical accounting policies and estimates related to Electric Utility Regulation, Asset Retirement Obligations, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, and Contingent Obligations. 
  Kemper IGCC Estimated Construction Costs, Project Completion Date, and Rate Recovery 
  During 2016, Mississippi Power further revised its cost estimate to complete construction and start-up of the Kemper IGCC to an amount that exceeds the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. Mississippi Power does not intend to seek any rate recovery for any costs related to the construction of the Kemper IGCC that exceed the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. 
  As a result of the revisions to the cost estimate, Southern Company recorded total pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable losses on the Kemper IGCC of   $88 million   (  $54 million   after tax) in the third quarter 2016, $81 million ($50 million after tax) in the second quarter 2016, $53 million ($33 million after tax) in the first quarter 2016, $183 million ($113 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2015, $150 million ($93 million after tax) in the third quarter 2015, $23 million ($14 million after tax) in the second quarter 2015, $9 million ($6 million after tax) in the first quarter 2015, $70 million ($43 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2014, $418 million ($258 million after tax) in the third quarter 2014, $380 million ($235 million after tax) in the first quarter 2014, $40 million ($25 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2013, $150 million ($93 million after tax) in the third quarter 2013, $450 million ($278 million after tax) in the second quarter 2013, and $540 million ($333 million after tax) in the first quarter 2013. In the aggregate, Southern Company has incurred charges of   $2.63 billion   (  $1.63 billion   after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through   September 30, 2016  . 
  Mississippi Power's revised cost estimate reflects an expected in-service date of December 31, 2016 and includes certain post-in-service costs which are expected to be subject to the cost cap. Mississippi Power has experienced, and may continue to experience, material changes in the cost estimate for the Kemper IGCC. Further cost increases and/or extensions of the expected in-service date may result from factors including, but not limited to, difficulties integrating the systems required for sustained operations, sustaining nitrogen supply, major equipment failure, unforeseen engineering or design problems including any repairs and/or modifications to systems, and/or operational performance (including additional costs to satisfy any operational parameters ultimately adopted by the Mississippi PSC). In addition, during the start-up and commissioning process, Mississippi Power is also identifying  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  
  SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

potential improvement projects that ultimately may be completed subsequent to placing the remainder of the Kemper IGCC in service. If completed, such improvement projects would be expected to enhance plant performance, safety, and/or operations. The related potential costs have yet to be fully evaluated, have not been included in the current cost estimates, and may be subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap. In subsequent periods, any further changes in the estimated costs of the Kemper IGCC subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions, will be reflected in Southern Company's statements of income and these changes could be material. 
  Any extension of the in-service date beyond December 31, 2016 is currently estimated to result in additional base costs of approximately   $25 million   to   $35 million   per month, which includes maintaining necessary levels of start-up labor, materials, and fuel, as well as operational resources required to execute start-up and commissioning activities. However, additional costs may be required for remediation of any further equipment and/or design issues identified. Any extension of the in-service date with respect to the Kemper IGCC beyond December 31, 2016 would also increase costs for the Cost Cap Exceptions, which are not subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap established by the Mississippi PSC. These costs include AFUDC, which is currently estimated to total approximately   $15 million   per month, as well as carrying costs and operating expenses on Kemper IGCC assets placed in service and consulting and legal fees of approximately   $3 million   per month. 
  Given the significant judgment involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up, the project completion date, the ultimate rate recovery for the Kemper IGCC, and the potential impact on Southern Company's results of operations, Southern Company considers these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information. 
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  Southern Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. Southern Company recognizes goodwill as of the acquisition date, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill will be tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur. Primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Southern Company Gas and PowerSecure in 2016, goodwill totaled approximately     $6.2 billion   at September 30, 2016. 
  Definite-lived intangible assets acquired are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible assets may not be recoverable, the intangible assets will be reviewed for impairment. Primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Southern Company Gas and PowerSecure in 2016, other intangible assets, net of amortization totaled approximately     $0.9 billion   at September 30, 2016. 
  The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can significantly impact Southern Company's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset, and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, Southern Company considers these estimates to be critical accounting estimates  . 
  See Note (A) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  " herein for additional information regarding Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets as of   September 30, 2016   and Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Company  " herein for additional information related to Southern Company's recent acquisitions.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
  Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value, unless the transactions qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales scope exception and are instead subject to traditional accrual accounting. For those transactions that do not qualify as a normal purchase or normal sale, changes in the derivatives' fair values are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, derivative gains and losses offset related results of the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or gains and losses are deferred in OCI until the hedged transaction occurs in the case of a cash flow hedge. Certain subsidiaries of Southern Company enter into energy-related derivatives that are designated as regulatory hedges where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through billings to customers. 
  Southern Company uses derivative instruments to reduce the impact to the results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas, to manage fuel hedging programs per guidelines of state regulatory agencies, and to mitigate residual changes in the price of electricity, weather, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of commodity derivative instruments used to manage exposure to changing prices reflects the estimated amounts that Southern Company would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date. To determine the fair value of the derivative instruments, Southern Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique. 
  Southern Company classifies derivative assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of the derivative instruments incorporates various factors required under the guidance. These factors include: 
             
    the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit); 
                
    events specific to a given counterparty; and 
                
    the impact of Southern Company's nonperformance risk on its liabilities. 
     Given the assumptions used in pricing the derivative asset or liability, Southern Company considers the valuation of derivative assets and liabilities a critical accounting estimate. See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 3 herein for more information. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases     (Topic 842)   (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged     and there is no change to the accounting for existing leveraged leases.     ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.   Southern Company is   currently evaluating the new standard and has not yet determined its ultimate impact; however, adoption of ASU 2016-02 is expected to have a significant impact on   Southern Company's   balance sheet. 
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation     (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 changes the accounting for income taxes and the cash flow presentation for share-based payment award transactions. Most significantly, entities are required to recognize all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock compensation as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.   Southern Company   currently recognizes any excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise and vesting of stock

compensation as additional paid-in capital. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and   Southern Company   intends to adopt the ASU in the fourth quarter 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of   Southern Company. 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
  Overview 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY       "Overview" of Southern Company in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Southern Company's financial condition remained stable at   September 30, 2016  . Through   September 30, 2016  , Southern Company has incurred non-recoverable cash expenditures of $2.42 billion and is expected to incur approximately $0.21 billion in additional non-recoverable cash expenditures through completion of the construction and start-up of the Kemper IGCC, which includes certain post-in-service costs expected to be subject to the cost cap. Southern Company intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as bank credit agreements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations  ," "  Sources of Capital  ," and "  Financing Activities  " herein for additional information. 
  Net cash provided from operating activities totaled   $4.3 billion   for the first   nine months of 2016  , a decrease of   $0.8 billion   from the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease in net cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in unutilized ITCs and PTCs. Net cash used for investing activities totaled   $16.6 billion   for the first   nine months of 2016   primarily due to the closing of the Merger, the construction of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards, and Southern Power's acquisitions and construction of renewable facilities. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled   $13.6 billion   for the first   nine months of 2016   primarily due to issuances of long-term debt and common stock associated with financing and completing the Merger and Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG, partially offset by redemptions of long-term debt and common stock dividend payments. Cash flows from financing activities vary from period to period based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities. 
  Significant balance sheet changes for the first   nine months of 2016   include an increase of   $14.4 billion   in total property, plant, and equipment primarily related to the inclusion of Southern Company Gas as a result of the Merger, construction to comply with environmental standards, and construction of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities; an increase of   $6.2 billion   in goodwill related to the acquisitions of Southern Company Gas and PowerSecure; an increase of   $1.5 billion   in equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries primarily related to Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG; increases of   $1.5 billion   in other regulatory assets, deferred and   $0.8 billion   in AROs primarily related to changes in ash pond closure strategy principally for Georgia Power; increases of   $16.9 billion   in long-term debt and   $4.0 billion   in total common stockholder's equity primarily associated with financing and completing the Merger and Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG; and increases of   $1.9 billion   in accumulated deferred income taxes and   $1.6 billion   in other cost of removal obligations primarily related to the inclusion of Southern Company Gas as a result of the Merger. See Notes (A) and (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein under "  Asset Retirement Obligations  " and "  Southern Company  ," respectively, for additional information. 
  At the end of the   third quarter 2016  , the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $51.30 per share (based on the closing price as reported on the New York Stock Exchange) and the book value was $25.05 per share, representing a market-to-book ratio of 205%, compared to $46.79, $22.59, and 207%, respectively, at the end of   2015  . Southern Company's common stock dividend for the   third quarter 2016   was $0.560 per share compared to $0.5425 per share in the   third quarter 2015  .

description of Southern Company's capital requirements for the construction programs of the Southern Company system, including estimated capital expenditures for new electric generating facilities and to comply with existing environmental statutes and regulations, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as related interest, derivative obligations, preferred and preference stock dividends, leases, purchase commitments, trust funding requirements, and unrecognized tax benefits. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, Mississippi Power repaid at maturity $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2011A 2.35% Senior Notes due October 15, 2016 and Southern Company Gas repaid at maturity $120 million aggregate principal amount of Series A Floating Rate Senior Notes due October 27, 2016. An additional   $1.8 billion   will be required through   September 30, 2017   to fund maturities of long-term debt. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and subsequent to that date, Southern Power entered into new long-term service agreements, which begin between 2017 and 2020 and result in additional future commitments totaling approximately   $927 million  .

  The Southern Company system's construction program is currently estimated to total $10.2 billion for 2016, $8.9 billion for 2017, $8.2 billion for 2018, $7.6 billion for 2019, $7.3 billion for 2020, and $6.6 billion for 2021. These amounts include expenditures of approximately $0.7 billion for 2016 and $0.1 billion for 2017 related to the construction and start-up of the Kemper IGCC; $0.6 billion for 2016, $0.6 billion for 2017, $0.7 billion for 2018, $0.4 billion for 2019, and $0.1 billion for 2020 to continue and complete construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; and $4.4 billion for 2016 and $1.5 billion per year for 2017 through 2021 for Southern Power's acquisitions and/or construction of new generating facilities. These estimated expenditures do not include potential compliance costs that may arise from the EPA's final rules and guidelines or subsequently approved state plans that would limit CO   2    emissions from existing, new, modified, or reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. 
  The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Additionally, planned expenditures for plant acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy. See Note 12 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Southern Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Power  " herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions.

  In addition, Georgia Power may make borrowings through a loan guarantee agreement (Loan Guarantee Agreement) between Georgia Power and the DOE, the proceeds of which may be used to reimburse Georgia Power for Eligible Project Costs incurred in connection with its construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Under the Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee borrowings of up to $3.46 billion (not to exceed 70% of Eligible Project Costs) to be made by Georgia Power under a multi-advance credit facility (FFB Credit Facility) among Georgia Power, the DOE, and the FFB. Eligible Project Costs incurred through   September 30, 2016   would allow for borrowings of up to   $2.6 billion   under the FFB Credit Facility, of which Georgia Power has borrowed   $2.5 billion  . See Note 6 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Loan Guarantee Agreement and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Georgia Power       Nuclear Construction  " herein for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
  Mississippi Power received $245 million of Initial DOE Grants in prior years that were used for the construction of the Kemper IGCC. An additional $25 million of grants from the DOE is expected to be received for commercial operation of the Kemper IGCC. On April 8, 2016, Mississippi Power received approximately $137 million in Additional DOE Grants for the Kemper IGCC, which are expected to be used to reduce future rate impacts for customers. In addition, see Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding legislation related to the securitization of certain costs of the Kemper IGCC. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Southern Company's current liabilities exceeded current assets by   $0.9 billion  , primarily due to long-term debt that is due within one year of   $2.3 billion  , including approximately $0.8 billion at the parent company,   $0.2 billion   at Alabama Power,   $0.5 billion   at Georgia Power,   $0.2 billion   at Gulf Power,   $0.3 billion   at Mississippi Power,   $0.1 billion   at Southern Power, and $0.1 billion at Southern Company Gas. To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Southern Company has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to capital markets and financial institutions. Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas intend to utilize operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines of credit, bank notes, and securities issuances, as market conditions permit, as well as, under certain circumstances for the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas, equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company to meet their short-term capital needs. In addition, Georgia Power expects to utilize borrowings through the FFB Credit Facility as an additional source of long-term borrowed funds.

  SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

At   September 30, 2016  , Southern Company and its subsidiaries had approximately   $2.7 billion   of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

(a) 
    Represents the Southern Company parent entity. 
              (b) 
    Excludes credit agreements (Project Credit Facilities) assumed with the acquisition of certain solar facilities, which are non-recourse to Southern Power Company, the proceeds of which are being used to finance project costs related to such solar facilities currently under construction. See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Power  " herein for additional information. 
              (c) 
    Southern Company Gas guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $1.3 billion of these arrangements. Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangements also include   $700 million   restricted for working capital needs of Nicor Gas. 
     See Note 6 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Bank Credit Arrangements" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Bank Credit Arrangements  " herein for additional information. 
  On May 24, 2016, the $8.1 billion Bridge Agreement to provide Merger financing, to the extent necessary, was terminated. 
  Most of these bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Power, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. Such cross default provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness or guarantee obligations over a specified threshold. Such cross acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, and Southern Company Gas are currently in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings. 
  Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 
  A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the traditional electric operating companies' pollution control revenue bonds and commercial paper programs. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $1.9 billion  . In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , the traditional electric operating companies had approximately   $358 million   of fixed rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding that were required to be reoffered within the next 12 months.

  SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above. Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas may also borrow through various other arrangements with banks. Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable in the balance sheets. 
  Details of short-term borrowings were as follows: 

(*) 
    Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the   three  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
     In addition to the short-term borrowings in the table above, the Project Credit Facilities had total amounts outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   of   $828 million   at a weighted average interest rate of   2.05%  . For the   three  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , these credit agreements had a maximum amount outstanding of   $828 million   and an average amount outstanding of   $805 million   at a weighted average interest rate of   2.02%  . 
  Furthermore, in connection with the acquisition of a solar facility on July 1, 2016, a subsidiary of Southern Power assumed a $217 million construction loan, which was fully repaid prior to   September 30, 2016  . For the   three  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , this credit agreement had a maximum amount outstanding of $217 million and an average amount outstanding of $137 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.21%. 
  Southern Company believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing commercial paper programs, lines of credit, bank term loans, and operating cash flows. 
  Credit Rating Risk 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Southern Company and its subsidiaries did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. 
  There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change of certain subsidiaries to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
  The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

  SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Southern Company and its subsidiaries to access capital markets, and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so. 
  On May 12, 2016, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Southern Company to A- from A and revised the ratings outlook from negative to stable. Fitch also downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Mississippi Power to BBB+ from A- and revised the ratings outlook from negative to stable. 
  On May 13, 2016, Moody's downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Southern Company to Baa2 from Baa1 and revised the ratings outlook from negative to stable. 
  On July 11, 2016, S P raised Southern Company Gas' and Nicor Gas' corporate and senior unsecured long-term debt ratings from BBB+ to A- and revised their ratings outlooks from positive to negative. 
  Financing Activities 
  On May 11, 2016, Southern Company issued 18.3 million shares of common stock in an underwritten offering for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $889 million. Of the 18.3 million shares, approximately 2.6 million were issued from treasury and the remainder were newly issued shares. The proceeds were used to fund a portion of the consideration for the Merger and for other general corporate purposes. 
  O  n August 19, 2016, Southern Company issued 32.5 million shares of common stock in an underwritten offering for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.6 billion. The proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the   SNG   investment and related transaction costs and for other general corporate purposes  . 
  In addition, during the first   nine months of 2016  , Southern Company issued approximately 17.5 million shares of common stock primarily through employee equity compensation plans and received proceeds of approximately $782 million. 
  The following table outlines the long-term debt financing activities for Southern Company and its subsidiaries for the first   nine months of 2016  : 

(a) 
    Includes reductions in capital lease obligations resulting from cash payments under capital leases. 
              (b) 
    Represents the Southern Company parent entity. 
              (c)

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In February 2016, Southern Company entered into $700 million notional amount of forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to interest rate changes related to anticipated debt issuances. These interest rate swaps were settled in May 2016. 
  In May 2016, Southern Company issued the following series of senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of $8.5 billion: 
         The net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the consideration for the Merger and related transaction costs and for other general corporate purposes. 
  In September 2016, Southern Company issued $800 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2016A 5.25% Junior Subordinated Notes due October 1, 2076. The proceeds were used to repay short-term indebtedness that was incurred to repay at maturity $500 million aggregate principal amount of Southern Company's Series 2011A 1.95% Senior Notes due September 1, 2016 and for other general corporate purposes. 
  Except as described herein, Southern Company's subsidiaries used the proceeds of the debt issuances shown in the table above for their redemptions and maturities shown in the table above, to repay short-term indebtedness, and for general corporate purposes, including their continuous construction programs and, for Southern Power, its growth strategy. 
  On March 8, 2016, Mississippi Power entered into an unsecured term loan agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions for an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion. Mississippi Power borrowed $900 million on March 8, 2016 under the term loan agreement and the remaining $300 million on October 7, 2016. Mississippi Power used the initial proceeds to repay $900 million in maturing bank loans on March 8, 2016 and the remaining $300 million to repay at maturity Mississippi Power's Series 2011A 2.35% Senior Notes due October 15, 2016. The term loan pursuant to this agreement matures on April 1, 2018 and bears interest based on one-month LIBOR. 
  In May 2016, Gulf Power entered into an 11-month floating rate bank loan bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR. This short-term loan was for $100 million aggregate principal amount and the proceeds were used to repay existing indebtedness and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
  Georgia Power's "Other Long-Term Debt Issuances" reflected in the table above include borrowings in June 2016 under the FFB Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $300 million at a   2.571%   interest rate through the final maturity date of February 20, 2044. The proceeds were used to reimburse Georgia Power for Eligible Project Costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Southern Power's subsidiaries incurred an additional $691 million of short-term borrowings pursuant to the Project Credit Facilities at a weighted average interest rate of 2.05%. Furthermore, in connection with the acquisition of a solar facility, a subsidiary of Southern Power assumed a $217 million construction loan, which was fully repaid prior to   September 30, 2016  . In addition, on October 14, 2016, Southern Power repaid at maturity $246 million of Project Credit Facility debt. 
  In June 2016, Southern Power issued  600 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2016A 1.00% Senior Notes due June 20, 2022 and  500 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2016B 1.85% Senior Notes due June 20, 2026. The proceeds are being allocated to renewable energy generation projects. Southern Power's obligations under its euro-denominated fixed-rate notes were effectively converted to fixed-rate U.S. dollars at issuance through cross-currency swaps, removing foreign currency exchange risk associated with the interest and principal payments.

  In September 2016, Southern Power repaid $80 million of an outstanding $400 million floating rate bank loan and extended the maturity date of the remaining $320 million from September 2016 to September 2018. In addition, Southern Power entered into a $60 million aggregate principal amount floating rate bank loan bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR due September 2017. The proceeds were used to repay existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. 
  In September 2016, Southern Company Gas Capital issued   $350 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.45%   Senior Notes due October 1, 2023 and   $550 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.95%   Senior Notes due October 1, 2046, both of which are guaranteed by Southern Company Gas. The proceeds were used to repay a   $360 million   promissory note issued to Southern Company for the purpose of funding a portion of the purchase price for Southern Company Gas'   50%   equity interest in SNG, to fund Southern Company Gas' purchase of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc.'s (Piedmont) interest in SouthStar, to make a voluntary pension contribution, to repay at maturity $120 million aggregate principal amount of Series A Floating Rate Senior Notes due October 27, 2016, and for general corporate purposes. See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Company         Investment in Southern Natural Gas  " and "       Acquisition of Remaining Interest in SouthStar  " herein for additional information regarding Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG and purchase of Piedmont's interest in SouthStar, respectively. 
  In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Southern Company and its subsidiaries plan to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

PART I 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  Other than the changes resulting from the Merger discussed below, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes to Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, Georgia Power's, Gulf Power's, Mississippi Power's, or Southern Power's disclosures about market risk. For an in-depth discussion of each registrant's market risks, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Market Price Risk" of each registrant in Item 7 of the Form 10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of each registrant under "Financial Instruments," Note 11 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power, Note 10 to the financial statements of Gulf Power and Mississippi Power, and Note 9 to the financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Also, see Note (C) and Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for information relating to derivative instruments. 
  As a result of closing the Merger, the Southern Company system's exposure to market risks includes Southern Company Gas. Southern Company Gas is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk, interest rate risk, and weather risk. Due to various cost recovery mechanisms, the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas that sell natural gas directly to their end-use customers have limited exposure to market volatility of natural gas prices. Certain natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices for customers. For the weather risk associated with Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas has a corporate weather hedging program that utilizes weather derivatives to reduce the risk of lower operating margins potentially resulting from significantly warmer-than-normal weather. In addition, certain non-regulated operations routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange-traded and over-the-counter energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements. Some of these economic hedge activities may not qualify, or are not designated, for hedge accounting treatment. If there is a significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions Southern Company uses to price the derivative assets or liabilities, such changes may have a significant impact on Southern Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
           (a) 
    Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
     As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Power conducted separate evaluations under the supervision and with the participation of each company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon these evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, in each case, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
           (b) 
    Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. 
     Other than the changes resulting from the Merger discussed below, there have been no changes in Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, Georgia Power's, Gulf Power's, Mississippi Power's, or Southern Power's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the   third quarter 2016   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, Georgia Power's, Gulf Power's, Mississippi Power's, or Southern Power's internal control over financial reporting. 
  Southern Company completed the Merger on July 1, 2016, with Southern Company Gas surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Southern Company. Southern Company is currently in the process of integrating Southern Company Gas' operations and conducting control reviews pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THIRD QUARTER 2016 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2015 
  AND 
  YEAR-TO-DATE 2016 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2015 

OVERVIEW 
  Alabama Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail and wholesale customers within its traditional service territory located within the State of Alabama in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast. 
  Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Alabama Power's business of selling electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment, to maintain and grow energy sales, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, increasingly stringent environmental standards, reliability, fuel, capital expenditures, and restoration following major storms. Alabama Power has various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Alabama Power for the foreseeable future. 
  Alabama Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock. For additional information on these indicators, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OVERVIEW   "Key Performance Indicators" of Alabama Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net Income 

Alabama Power's net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock for the   third quarter 2016   was   $350 million   compared to   $295 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase in net income was related to an increase in revenue primarily due to warmer weather in the third quarter 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, an increase in retail revenues under Rate CNP Compliance, and a decrease in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses. These increases to income were partially offset by a decrease in AFUDC and an increase in depreciation and amortization. 
  Alabama Power's net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock for   year-to-date 2016   was   $717 million   compared to   $665 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily related to an increase in retail revenues under Rate CNP Compliance and decreases in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses and dividends on preferred and preference stock for   year-to-date 2016   compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . These increases to income were partially offset by a decrease in AFUDC and increases in interest expense and depreciation and amortization.

Retail Revenues 

In the   third quarter 2016  , retail revenues were   $1.63 billion   compared to   $1.56 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , retail revenues were   $4.14 billion   compared to   $4.15 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . 
  Details of the changes in retail revenues were as follows: 

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the   third quarter   and   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily due to increased revenues under Rate CNP Compliance associated with increases in the average net investments. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Revenues attributable to changes in sales declined in the   third quarter   and   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . Industrial KWH sales decreased 6.3% and 5.1% for the   third quarter   and   year-to-date 2016  , respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   as a result of a decrease in demand resulting from changes in production levels primarily in the primary metals, chemicals, pipelines, paper, and stone, clay, and glass sectors. A strong dollar, low oil prices, and weak global economic conditions have constrained growth in the industrial sector. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 2.4% for the   third quarter 2016   due to lower customer usage primarily resulting from an increase in efficiency improvements in residential appliances and lighting, partially offset by customer growth, and remained relatively flat   year-to-date 2016  . Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales remained relatively flat for the   third quarter   and   year-to-date 2016  . 
  Revenues resulting from changes in weather increased in the   third quarter 2016   due to warmer weather experienced in Alabama Power's service territory compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . For the   third quarter 2016  , the resulting increases were 6.2% and 2.3% for residential and commercial sales revenue, respectively. 
  Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased in the   third quarter 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015   primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of fuel. Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015   primarily due to a decrease in KWH generation and a decrease in the average cost of fuel. Electric rates include provisions to recognize the full recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs associated with the natural disaster reserve. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

Wholesale Revenues       Non-Affiliates 

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $  82 million   compared to $  65 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a 45.3% increase in KWH sales as the result of a new wholesale contract effective December 2015, partially offset by a 13.4% decrease in the price of energy as a result of lower gas prices. For   year-to-date 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were $  211 million   compared to $  188 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a 29.7% increase in KWH sales as a result of a new wholesale contract effective December 2015, partially offset by a 13.1% decrease in the price of energy as a result of lower gas prices  . 
  Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 

For   year-to-date 2016  , fuel and purchased power expenses were   $1.24 billion   compared to   $1.36 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a $56 million decrease related to the average cost of fuel, a $43 million decrease related to the average cost of purchased power, and a $35 million decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated. These decreases were partially offset by a $19 million increase in the volume of KWHs purchased. 
  Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate ECR" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

Details of Alabama Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 

(a)   
    KWHs generated by hydro are excluded from the average cost of fuel, generated. 
              (b)   
    Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider. 
     Fuel 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , fuel expense was   $0.97 billion   compared to   $1.06 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a 14.9% decrease in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, which excludes fuel associated with tolling agreements, and a 10.4% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, partially offset by a 17.4% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas. 
  Purchased Power   Non-Affiliates 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , purchased power expense from non-affiliates was   $63 million   compared to   $56 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a 47.8% increase in the amount of energy purchased as a result of lower cost generation, partially offset by a 23.5% decrease in the average cost of purchased power per KHW due to a decrease in transmission capacity charges. 
  Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. 
  Purchased Power   Affiliates 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , purchased power expense from affiliates was   $41 million   compared to   $51 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a 14.4% decrease in the average cost of purchased power per KWH as a result of lower capacity charges and a 4.4% decrease in the amount of energy purchased due to the availability of lower cost energy. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , purchased power expense from affiliates was   $129 million   compared to   $153 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily related to a 17.3% decrease in the average cost of purchased power per KWH as a result of lower natural gas prices.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC. 
  Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 

In the   third quarter 2016  , other operations and maintenance expenses were   $348 million   compared to   $371 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a net decrease of $8 million in employee compensation and benefits, including pension costs. In addition, scheduled other power generation outage costs and uncollectible customer account expenses decreased $8 million and $3 million, respectively. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , other operations and maintenance expenses were   $1.10 billion   compared to   $1.14 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a net decrease of $22 million in employee compensation and benefits, including pension costs. In addition, scheduled steam and other power generation outage costs decreased $18 million. 
  See Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information related to pension costs. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 

In the   third quarter 2016  , depreciation and amortization was   $177 million   compared to   $163 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , depreciation and amortization was   $524 million   compared to   $481 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . These increases were primarily the result of an increase in depreciation of compliance related steam equipment. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate CNP" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 

In the   third quarter 2016  , taxes other than income taxes were   $96 million   compared to   $91 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , taxes other than income taxes were   $286 million   compared to   $275 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . These increases were primarily due to increases in state and municipal utility license tax bases and increases in ad valorem taxes primarily due to an increase in assessed value of property.

Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction 

In the   third quarter 2016  , AFUDC equity was   $7 million   compared to   $14 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , AFUDC equity was   $23 million   compared to   $43 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . These decreases were primarily associated with environmental compliance and steam generation capital projects being placed in service in 2016. 
  Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized 

In the   third quarter 2016  , interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was   $77 million   compared to   $71 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt outstanding and a reduction in amounts capitalized. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was   $224 million   compared to   $205 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt outstanding and a reduction in amounts capitalized. See "Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction" herein, FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Financing Activities   Financial Condition and Liquidity" herein, and Note 6 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Senior Notes" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Other Income (Expense), Net 

For   year-to-date 2016  , other income (expense), net was   $(16) million   compared to   $(24) million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The change was primarily due to a decrease in donations, partially offset by a decrease in sales of non-utility property in 2016. 
  Income Taxes 

In the   third quarter 2016  , income taxes were   $221 million   compared to   $192 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings in 2016. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , income taxes were   $466 million   compared to   $427 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and state tax credits taken in 2015.

Dividends on Preferred and Preference Stock 

For   year-to-date 2016  , dividends on preferred and preference stock were   $13 million   compared to   $21 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to the redemption in May 2015 of certain series of preferred and preference stock. See Note 6 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Redeemable Preferred and Preference Stock" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
   
  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 
  The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of Alabama Power's future earnings potential. The level of Alabama Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Alabama Power's primary business of selling electricity. These factors include Alabama Power's ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that continues to allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining and growing sales which are subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Alabama Power's service territory. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by economic growth. The pace of economic growth and electricity demand may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. For additional information relating to these issues, see RISK FACTORS in Item 1A and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL of Alabama Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
  Environmental Matters 
  Compliance costs related to federal and state environmental statutes and regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are completed. Environmental compliance costs are recovered through Rate CNP Compliance. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate CNP" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Environmental Matters" of Alabama Power in Item 7 and Note 3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Environmental Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Environmental Statutes and Regulations 
  Air Quality 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Environmental Matters       Environmental Statutes and Regulations       Air Quality" of   Alabama Power   in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the EPA's final MATS rule, regional haze regulations,   and the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). 
  On April 25, 2016, in response to a June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court opinion, the EPA published its supplemental finding regarding consideration of costs in support of the MATS rule. This finding does not impact MATS rule

compliance requirements, costs, or deadlines, and   all Alabama Power units   that are subject to the MATS rule completed the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the MATS rule by the applicable deadlines. 
  Also on April 25, 2016, the EPA issued proposed revisions to the regional haze regulations. The ultimate impact of the proposed revisions will depend on their ultimate adoption, implementation, and any legal challenges and cannot be determined at this time. 
  On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates the CSAPR ozone season nitrogen oxide program, including revising ozone-season emissions budgets in   Alabama  . The ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of any legal challenges and implementation at the state level and cannot be determined at this time. 
  FERC Matters 
  See BUSINESS   "Regulation   Federal Power Act" in Item 1 of the Form 10-K for a discussion of Alabama Power's hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River. On April 21, 2016, the FERC issued an order granting in part and denying in part Alabama Power's rehearing request of the new license for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River. The order also denied rehearing requests filed by Alabama Rivers Alliance, American Rivers, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, and the Atlanta Regional Commission. On May 17, 2016, Alabama Rivers Alliance and American Rivers filed an additional rehearing request and also filed a petition for review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On September 12, 2016, the FERC issued an order denying the second rehearing request, and Alabama Rivers Alliance and American Rivers filed an appeal of the April 21, 2016 order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Retail Regulatory Matters 
  Alabama Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Alabama PSC. Alabama Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through its Rate RSE, Rate CNP Compliance, rate energy cost recovery, and rate natural disaster reserve. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting Alabama Power. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Nuclear Outage Accounting Order" and "Retail Regulatory Matters," respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Alabama Power's rate mechanisms and accounting orders. The recovery balance of each regulatory clause for Alabama Power is reported in Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein. 
  Environmental Accounting Order 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Retail Regulatory Matters   Environmental Accounting Order" of Alabama Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for information regarding the environmental accounting order. 
  In April 2016, as part of its environmental compliance strategy, Alabama Power ceased using coal at Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (300 MWs representing Alabama Power's ownership interest) and began operating Units 1 and 2 solely on natural gas in June 2016 and July 2016, respectively. 
  Renewables 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Retail Regulatory Matters   Renewables" of Alabama Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for information regarding renewable energy projects. 
  In accordance with the Alabama PSC order approving up to 500 MWs of renewable projects, Alabama Power has entered into agreements to purchase power from or to build renewable generation sources, including a 72-MW solar PPA approved by the Alabama PSC in June 2016. Alabama Power is marketing the associated renewable energy credits (REC) generated by this solar PPA to customers interested in supporting renewable energy development. The  
  
   59

terms of the renewable agreements permit Alabama Power to use the energy and retire the associated RECs in service of its customers or to sell RECs, separately or bundled with energy. 
  Other Matters 
  Alabama Power is   involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition,   Alabama Power is   subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.   Alabama Power's   business activities   are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as regulation of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, such as air quality and water standards, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO   2    and other emissions  , CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. 
  The     ultimate     outcome     of     such     pending     or     potential     litigation     against     Alabama Power     cannot     be     predicted     at     this     time;     however,     for     current     proceedings     not     specifically     reported     in     Note     (B)     to     the     Condensed     Financial     Statements     herein     or     in     Note     3     to     the     financial     statements     of     Alabama Power     in     Item     8     of     the Form 10-K,     management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on   Alabama Power's   financial statements. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential. 
  ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Alabama Power prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the financial statements of Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Alabama Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   ACCOUNTING POLICIES   "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of Alabama Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a complete discussion of Alabama Power's critical accounting policies and estimates related to Electric Utility Regulation, Asset Retirement Obligations, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, and Contingent Obligations. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases     (Topic 842)   (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged  .   ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.   Alabama Power is   currently evaluating the new standard and has not yet determined its ultimate impact; however, adoption of ASU 2016-02 is expected to have a significant impact on   Alabama Power's   balance sheet. 
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation     (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 changes the accounting for income taxes and the cash flow presentation for share-based payment award transactions. Most significantly, entities are required to recognize all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock compensation as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.   Alabama Power   currently recognizes any excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise and vesting of stock compensation as additional paid-in capital. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early

adoption is permitted and   Alabama Power   intends to adopt the ASU in the fourth quarter 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of   Alabama Power. 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
  Overview 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Overview" of Alabama Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Alabama Power's financial condition remained stable at   September 30, 2016  . Alabama Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations  ," "  Sources of Capital  ," and "  Financing Activities  " herein for additional information. 
  Net cash provided from operating activities totaled   $1.5 billion   for the first   nine months of 2016  , a decrease of $44 million as compared to the first   nine months of 2015  . The decrease in net cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to lower fuel cost recovery revenues during 2016, partially offset by lower income tax payments and the receipt of income tax refunds as a result of bonus depreciation. Net cash used for investing activities totaled   $1.1 billion   for the first   nine months of 2016   primarily due to gross property additions related to environmental, distribution, steam generation, and transmission. Net cash used for financing activities totaled   $91 million   for the first   nine months of 2016   primarily due to common stock dividend payments and a redemption of long-term debt, partially offset by issuances of long-term debt and additional capital contributions from Southern Company. Cash flows from financing activities vary from period to period based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities. 
  Significant balance sheet changes for the first   nine months of 2016   include increases of $422 million in property, plant, and equipment, primarily due to additions to environmental, distribution, nuclear generation, and transmission, $362 million in cash and cash equivalents, $266 million in additional paid-in capital due to capital contributions from Southern Company, $264 million in accumulated deferred income taxes related to bonus depreciation, and $205 million in long-term debt primarily due to the issuance of additional senior notes. Other significant changes include decreases of $239 million in other regulatory liabilities, current, primarily due to the timing of fuel cost recovery and $177 million in other accounts payable primarily due to the timing of vendor payments. 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Alabama Power's rate mechanisms. 
  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" of Alabama Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a description of Alabama Power's capital requirements for its construction program, including estimated capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental statutes and regulations, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preferred and preference stock dividends, leases, purchase commitments, and trust funding requirements. Approximately   $236 million   will be required through   September 30, 2017   to fund maturities of long-term debt. 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Environmental Matters   Environmental Statutes and Regulations   General" and "   Global Climate Issues" of Alabama Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information on Alabama Power's environmental compliance strategy. 
  Alabama Power's approved construction program is currently estimated to total $1.9 billion for 2017, $1.6 billion for 2018, $1.2 billion for 2019, $1.3 billion for 2020, and $1.2 billion for 2021. The construction program includes capital expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel and capital expenditures covered under long-term service agreements. Estimated capital expenditures to comply with environmental statutes and

regulations included in these amounts are $0.5 billion for 2017, $0.3 billion for 2018, $0.1 billion for 2019, $0.1 billion for 2020, and $0.2 billion for 2021. These estimated expenditures include anticipated costs for compliance with the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities final rule (CCR Rule) and the EPA's final effluent guidelines rule. These estimated expenditures do not include potential compliance costs that may arise from the EPA's final rules and guidelines or subsequently approved state plans that would limit CO   2    emissions from existing, new, modified, or reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. 
  Alabama Power also anticipates costs associated with closure in place and ground water monitoring of ash ponds in accordance with the CCR Rule, which are not reflected in the capital expenditures above as these costs are associated with Alabama Power's asset retirement obligation liabilities. These costs, which will change as Alabama Power continues to refine its assumptions underlying the cost estimates and evaluate the method and timing of compliance, are estimated to be $31 million for 2017, $26 million for 2018, $100 million for 2019, $105 million for 2020, and $107 million for 2021. See Note 1 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Costs associated with the CCR Rule are expected to be recovered through Rate CNP Compliance. 
  The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Alabama PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. 
  Sources of Capital 
  Alabama Power plans to obtain the funds to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, short-term debt, term loans, external security issuances, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Sources of Capital" of Alabama Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Alabama Power's current liabilities sometimes exceed current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Alabama Power had approximately   $556 million   of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

See Note 6 to the financial statements of Alabama Power under "Bank Credit Arrangements" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Bank Credit Arrangements  " herein for additional information. 
  Most of these bank credit arrangements, as well as Alabama Power's term loan arrangements, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) of Alabama Power. Such cross acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Alabama Power defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Alabama Power is currently in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings. 
  Subject to applicable market conditions, Alabama Power expects to renew or replace its bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Alabama Power may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 
  A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to Alabama Power's pollution control revenue bonds and commercial paper borrowings. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $890 million  . In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , Alabama Power had   $87 million   of fixed rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding that were required to be reoffered within the next 12 months. 
  Alabama Power also has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to capital markets, including a commercial paper program, to meet liquidity needs. Alabama Power may meet short-term cash needs through its commercial paper program. Alabama Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of Alabama Power and the other traditional electric operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of Alabama Power are loaned directly to Alabama Power. The obligations of each company under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support.

    Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the   three  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . No short-term debt was outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
     Alabama Power believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing commercial paper programs, lines of credit, short-term bank notes, and operating cash flows. 
  Credit Rating Risk 
  Alabama Power does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. 
  There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity purchases, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, and transmission. The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at   September 30, 2016   were as follows:

Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company system power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Alabama Power to access capital markets, and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so. 
  Financing Activities 
  In January 2016, Alabama Power issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2016A 4.30% Senior Notes due January 2, 2046. The proceeds were used to repay at maturity $200 million aggregate principal amount of Alabama Power's Series FF 5.20% Senior Notes due January 15, 2016 and for general corporate purposes, including Alabama Power's continuous construction program. 
  In March 2016, Alabama Power entered into three bank term loan agreements with maturity dates of March 2021, in an aggregate principal amount of $45 million, one of which bears interest at 2.38% per annum and two of which bear interest based on three-month LIBOR. 
  In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Alabama Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THIRD QUARTER 2016 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2015 
  AND 
  YEAR-TO-DATE 2016 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2015 

OVERVIEW 
  Georgia Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers within its traditional service territory located within the State of Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. 
  Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Georgia Power's business of selling electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment, to maintain and grow energy sales, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, increasingly stringent environmental standards, reliability, and fuel. In addition, construction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power will own a 45.7% interest in these two nuclear generating units to increase its generation diversity and meet future supply needs. Georgia Power has various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and     appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Georgia Power for the foreseeable future.  
  On October 20, 2016, Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC Staff entered into a settlement agreement resolving certain prudence and cost recovery matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The settlement agreement is subject to approval by the Georgia PSC. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Nuclear Construction  " herein for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement related to Southern Company's acquisition of Southern Company Gas approved by the Georgia PSC on April 14, 2016, Georgia Power's 2013 ARP will continue in effect until December 31, 2019, and Georgia Power will be required to file its next base rate case by July 1, 2019. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Retail Regulatory Matters  " herein for additional information. 
  Georgia Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, the execution of major construction projects, and net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock. For additional information on these indicators, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OVERVIEW   "Key Performance Indicators" of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net Income 

Georgia Power's net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was   $598 million   for the   third quarter 2016   compared to   $551 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail base revenues effective January 1, 2016, as authorized by the Georgia PSC, and higher retail revenues due to warmer weather as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was   $1.21 billion   compared to   $1.06 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail base revenues effective January 1, 2016, as authorized by the Georgia PSC, the 2015 correction of an error affecting billings to a small number of large commercial and industrial customers, higher retail revenues in the   third quarter

     Table of Contents  
  GEORGIA POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

2016   due to warmer weather as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, and lower non-fuel operating expenses. Partially offsetting the increase were lower retail revenues in the first quarter 2016 due to milder weather as compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . 
  Retail Revenues 

Retail revenues increased slightly in the   third quarter 2016   compared to the corresponding period in 2015. For   year-to-date 2016  , retail revenues were   $6.16 billion   compared to   $6.22 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . 
  Details of the changes in retail revenues were as follows: 

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the   third quarter   and   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily due to increases in base tariffs approved under the 2013 ARP and the NCCR tariff, all effective January 1, 2016. Also contributing to the increase for   year-to-date 2016   was the 2015 correction of an error affecting billings since 2013 to a small number of large commercial and industrial customers under a rate plan allowing for variable demand-driven pricing. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate Plans" and "   Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Revenues attributable to changes in sales were essentially flat in the third quarter and   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased 1.7%, weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 0.7%, and weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales decreased 3.4% in the   third quarter 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased 1.0%, weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 0.6%, and weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales decreased 0.5% when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . An increase of approximately 29,000 residential customers since   September 30, 2015   contributed to the increase in weather-adjusted residential KWH sales, partially offset by a decline in average customer usage primarily resulting from an increase in multi-family housing and efficiency improvements in residential appliances and lighting. A decline in average customer usage resulting from an increase in energy saving initiatives contributed to the decrease in weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales, partially offset by an increase of approximately 3,000 commercial customers since   September 30, 2015  . Decreased demand in the pipeline, textiles, and stone, clay, and glass sectors was the main contributor to the decrease in weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales, partially offset by increased demand in the non-manufacturing sector. 
  Fuel revenues and costs are allocated between retail and wholesale jurisdictions. Retail fuel cost recovery revenues decreased $125 million and $304 million in the   third quarter   and   year-to-date 2016  , respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily due to lower fuel prices. Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel  
  
   71 

     Table of Contents  
  GEORGIA POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Fuel Cost Recovery  " herein for additional information. 
  Wholesale Revenues       Non-Affiliates 

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale revenues from PPAs have both capacity and energy components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized either on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract period or the amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost to produce the energy. 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were   $49 million   compared to   $55 million   for the corresponding period in   2015   related to a $7 million decrease in capacity revenues, partially offset by a $1 million increase in energy revenues. For   year-to-date 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were   $131 million   compared to   $173 million   for the corresponding period in   2015   related to a $28 million decrease in capacity revenues and a $14 million decrease in energy revenues. The decreases in capacity revenues reflect the expiration of wholesale contracts in the second quarter 2016. In addition, the decrease in capacity revenues for   year-to-date 2016   reflects the retirement of 14 coal-fired generating units since March 31, 2015 as a result of Georgia Power's environmental compliance strategy. The decrease in energy revenues for   year-to-date 2016   was primarily due to lower fuel prices. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Environmental Matters   Environmental Statutes and Regulations   Air Quality" and "Retail Regulatory Matters   Integrated Resource Plan" of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information related to Georgia Power's environmental compliance strategy. 
  Other Revenues 

For   year-to-date 2016  , other revenues were   $302 million   compared to   $271 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $14 million increase related to customer temporary facilities services revenues, a $9 million increase in outdoor lighting revenues, and a $3 million increase in solar application fee revenues. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Retail Regulatory Matters     Renewables" herein for additional information on Georgia Power's solar renewable energy program.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 

In the   third quarter 2016  , total fuel and purchased power expenses were   $819 million   compared to   $944 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease in the   third quarter 2016   was due to a net decrease of $189 million in the average cost of fuel and purchased power related to lower coal prices, partially offset by a $64 million increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased as a result of warmer weather as compared to the corresponding period in   2015   resulting in higher customer demand. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , total fuel and purchased power expenses were   $2.06 billion   compared to   $2.37 billion   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease in   year-to-date 2016   was primarily due to a decrease of $326 million in the average cost of fuel and purchased power related to lower coal and natural gas prices and a $20 million decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated, partially offset by a $32 million increase related to the volume of KWHs purchased primarily as a result of warmer weather in the third quarter 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in   2015   resulting in higher customer demand. 
  Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally offset by fuel revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Fuel Cost Recovery  " herein for additional information. 
  Details of Georgia Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:

     Table of Contents  
  GEORGIA POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Fuel 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , fuel expense was   $575 million   compared to   $706 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a 26.7% decrease in the average cost of fuel per KWH generated primarily resulting from lower coal prices, partially offset by a 6.6% increase in the volume of KWHs generated due to warmer weather as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , fuel expense was   $1.39 billion   compared to   $1.74 billion   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a 21.5% decrease in the average cost of fuel per KWH generated primarily resulting from lower coal and natural gas prices and a 3.0% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal. 
  Purchased Power   Non-Affiliates 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , purchased power expense from non-affiliates was   $102 million   compared to   $90 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an 18.3% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased due to warmer weather as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, partially offset by a 5.6% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily resulting from lower natural gas prices. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , purchased power expense from non-affiliates was   $277 million   compared to   $227 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a 29.8% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased, partially offset by a 10.4% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily resulting from lower natural gas prices. 
  Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. 
  Purchased Power   Affiliates 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , purchased power expense from affiliates was   $142 million   compared to   $148 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was the result of a 2.4% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased as Georgia Power's units generally dispatched at a lower cost than other available Southern Company system resources, partially offset by a 1.8% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , purchased power expense from affiliates was   $392 million   compared to   $411 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily the result of a 2.7% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the lower market cost of available energy as compared to Southern Company system resources. 
  Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the FERC. 
  Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 

In the   third quarter 2016  , other operations and maintenance expenses were   $496 million   compared to   $462 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $26 million charge in connection with an employee attrition plan associated with cost containment activities, an $11 million increase in scheduled generation outage and maintenance costs, and an $11 million increase in transmission and distribution overhead line maintenance, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in pension costs. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , other operations and maintenance expenses were   $1.39 billion   compared to   $1.41 billion   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $31 million in scheduled generation outage and maintenance costs and $28 million in pension costs, partially offset by a $26 million charge  
  
   74 

     Table of Contents  
  GEORGIA POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

in connection with an employee attrition plan associated with cost containment activities, an increase of $16 million in transmission and distribution overhead line maintenance, and an increase of $9 million for integrated transmission system billings. 
  See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Other Matters  " and Note (F) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information related to the employee attrition plan and pension costs, respectively. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 

For   year-to-date 2016  , depreciation and amortization was   $639 million   compared to   $633 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $25 million increase related to additional plant in service and a $9 million increase in other cost of removal, partially offset by a decrease of $14 million related to amortization of nuclear construction financing costs that was completed in December 2015 and a decrease of $13 million related to unit retirements. 
  Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 

In the   third quarter 2016  , taxes other than income taxes were   $114 million   compared to   $107 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , taxes other than income taxes were   $311 million   compared to   $302 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to increases in property taxes of $5 million and $8 million in the third quarter and   year-to-date 2016  , respectively, as a result of an increase in the assessed value of property. 
  Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized 

In the   third quarter 2016  , interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was   $98 million   compared to   $90 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $7 million increase in interest due to additional long-term borrowings from the FFB and higher interest rates on obligations for pollution control revenue bonds remarketed in 2015. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was   $290 million   compared to   $272 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $27 million increase in interest due to additional long-term borrowings from the FFB and higher interest rates on obligations for pollution control revenue bonds remarketed in 2015, partially offset by an increase of $5 million in AFUDC debt and a decrease of $4 million in interest due to lower interest rates on obligations for senior notes.

Income Taxes 

In the   third quarter 2016  , income taxes were   $365 million   compared to   $337 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , income taxes were   $737 million   compared to   $657 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings. 
   
  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 
  The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of Georgia Power's future earnings potential. The level of Georgia Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Georgia Power's business of selling electricity. These factors include Georgia Power's ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that continues to allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs and the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing construction projects, primarily Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining and growing sales which are subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Georgia Power's service territory. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by economic growth. The pace of economic growth and electricity demand may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. For additional information relating to these issues, see RISK FACTORS in Item 1A and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
  Environmental Matters 
  Compliance costs related to federal and state environmental statutes and regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis. Georgia Power's Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR) tariff allows for the recovery of capital and operations and maintenance costs related to environmental controls mandated by state and federal regulations. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are completed. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

compliance requirements, costs, or deadlines, and   all Georgia Power units   that are subject to the MATS rule completed the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the MATS rule by the applicable deadlines. 
  Also on April 25, 2016, the EPA issued proposed revisions to the regional haze regulations. The ultimate impact of the proposed revisions will depend on their ultimate adoption, implementation, and any legal challenges and cannot be determined at this time. 
  On   September 6, 2016, the EPA designated all remaining areas within   Georgia Power's service territory   as attainment for the 2012 annual fine particulate matter NAAQS. 
  On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates the CSAPR ozone season nitrogen oxide program, including revising ozone-season emissions budgets in   Alabama and certain other states. The State of Georgia's emission budget was not affected by the revisions but interstate emissions trading is restricted unless the state decides to voluntarily adopt a reduced budget  . The ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of any legal challenges and implementation at the state level and cannot be determined at this time. 
  Coal Combustion Residuals 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Environmental Matters       Environmental Statutes and Regulations       Coal Combustion Residuals" of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the EPA's regulation of CCR. 
  On June 13, 2016, Georgia Power announced that all of its 29 ash ponds will cease operations and stop receiving coal ash in the next three years, and all ponds will eventually be closed either by removal, consolidation, and/or recycling for the beneficial use of coal ash or through closure in place using advanced engineering methods. On October 26, 2016, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources approved amendments to its state solid waste regulations to incorporate the requirements of the EPA's Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities Rule (CCR Rule) and establish additional requirements for all of Georgia Power's onsite storage units consisting of landfills and surface impoundments. The final State of Georgia regulations are not anticipated to have a material impact on   Georgia Power's   compliance obligations under the CCR Rule.   See Note (A) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding Georgia Power's asset retirement obligations (ARO) as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Retail Regulatory Matters 
  Georgia Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through the 2013 ARP, which includes traditional base tariff rates, Demand-Side Management tariffs, ECCR tariffs, and Municipal Franchise Fee tariffs. In addition, financing costs related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected through separate fuel cost recovery tariffs. See "  Nuclear Construction  " herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the NCCR tariff. Also see "  Fuel Cost Recovery  " herein for additional information regarding fuel cost recovery. 
  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement related to Southern Company's acquisition of Southern Company Gas approved by the Georgia PSC on April 14, 2016, Georgia Power's 2013 ARP will continue in effect until December 31, 2019, and Georgia Power will be required to file its next base rate case by July 1, 2019. Furthermore, through December 31, 2019, Georgia Power and Atlanta Gas Light Company (collectively, Utilities) each will retain their respective merger savings, net of transition costs, as defined in the settlement agreement; through December 31, 2022, such net merger savings applicable to each utility will be shared on a 60/40 basis between their respective customers and the Utilities; thereafter, all merger savings will be retained by customers. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the 2013 ARP.

Renewables 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Retail Regulatory Matters   Renewables" of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for information regarding renewable energy projects. 
  As part of the Georgia Power Advanced Solar Initiative (ASI), four PPAs totaling 149 MWs of solar contracted capacity from Southern Power began in the first quarter 2016. During the second quarter 2016, Georgia Power executed PPAs to purchase an additional 41 MWs of solar capacity under the ASI. Ownership of any associated renewable energy credits (REC) is specified in each respective PPA. The party that owns the RECs retains the right to use them. 
  On October 4, 2016, two 30-MW solar generating facilities at Fort Gordon and Fort Stewart Army bases began commercial operation. These solar generating facilities were approved by the Georgia PSC in 2014. 
  Integrated Resource Plan 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Retail Regulatory Matters   Integrated Resource Plan" of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Georgia Power's triennial Integrated Resource Plan (2016 IRP). 
  On July 28, 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2016 IRP including the decertification and retirement of Plant Mitchell Units 3, 4A, and 4B (217 MWs) and Plant Kraft Unit 1 combustion turbine (17 MWs), as well as the decertification of the Intercession City unit (143 MWs total capacity). On August 2, 2016, the Plant Mitchell and Plant Kraft units were retired. On August 31, 2016, Georgia Power sold its 33% ownership interest in the Intercession City unit to Duke Energy Florida, Inc. 
  Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's environmental compliance strategy and related expenditures proposed in the 2016 IRP, including measures taken to comply with existing government-imposed environmental mandates, subject to limits on expenditures for Plant McIntosh Unit 1 and Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4. 
  The Georgia PSC approved the reclassification of the remaining net book value of Plant Mitchell Unit 3 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date to a regulatory asset. Recovery of the unit's net book value will continue through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP. The timing of the recovery of the remaining balance of the unit's net book value as of December 31, 2019 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date will be deferred for consideration in Georgia Power's base rate case required to be filed by July 1, 2019. 
  The Georgia PSC also approved the Renewable Energy Development Initiative to procure an additional 1,200 MWs of renewable resources primarily utilizing market-based prices established through a competitive bidding process with expected in-service dates between 2018 and 2021. Additionally, 200 MWs of self-build capacity for use by Georgia Power was approved, as well as consideration for no more than 200 MWs of capacity as part of a renewable commercial and industrial program. 
  The Georgia PSC also approved recovery of costs up to $99 million through June 30, 2019 to preserve the nuclear option at a future generation site in Stewart County, Georgia. The timing of cost recovery will be determined by the Georgia PSC in a future base rate case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Fuel Cost Recovery 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery" of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for information regarding fuel cost recovery. 
  Georgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. On May 17, 2016, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to decrease fuel rates by 15% effective June 1, 2016, which will

reduce annual billings by approximately $313 million. Georgia Power is currently scheduled to file its next fuel case by February 28, 2017. 
  Storm Damage Recovery 
  As of September 30, 2016, the balance in Georgia Power's regulatory asset related to storm damage was $94 million. During October 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities. The total amount of restoration costs related to this hurricane is estimated to be between $130 million and $155 million, which will be charged to capital accounts or to the storm damage reserve. Georgia Power is accruing $30 million annually through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP, to the storm damage reserve to cover the operating and maintenance costs of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities, which is recoverable through base rates. The rate of recovery of storm damage costs after December 31, 2019 is expected to be adjusted in Georgia Power's base rate case required to be filed by July 1, 2019. As a result of this regulatory treatment, costs related to storms are not expected to have a material impact on Georgia Power's financial statements. See Note 1 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Storm Damage Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Georgia Power's storm damage reserve. 
  Nuclear Construction 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, Vogtle Construction Monitoring (VCM) reports, the NCCR tariff, the Vogtle Construction Litigation (as defined below), and the Contractor Settlement Agreement (as defined below). 
  In 2008, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Vogtle Owners, entered into an agreement with the Contractor, pursuant to which the Contractor agreed to design, engineer, procure, construct, and test Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement). 
  Under the terms of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, the Vogtle Owners agreed to pay a purchase price subject to certain price escalations and adjustments, including fixed escalation amounts and index-based adjustments, as well as adjustments for change orders, and performance bonuses for early completion and unit performance. The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement also provides for liquidated damages upon the Contractor's failure to fulfill the schedule and performance guarantees, subject to a cap. In addition, the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement provides for limited cost sharing by the Vogtle Owners for Contractor costs under certain conditions (which have not occurred), with maximum additional capital costs under this provision attributable to Georgia Power (based on Georgia Power's ownership interest) of approximately   $114 million  . Each Vogtle Owner is severally (and not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to the Contractor under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. Georgia Power's proportionate share is   45.7%  . 
  On December 31, 2015, Westinghouse acquired Stone   Webster, Inc. from Chicago Bridge   Iron Company, N.V. (CB I) and changed the name of Stone   Webster, Inc. to WECTEC Global Project Services Inc. (WECTEC). Certain obligations of Westinghouse and WECTEC under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement were originally guaranteed by Toshiba Corporation (Westinghouse's parent company) and The Shaw Group Inc. (which is now a subsidiary of CB I), respectively. On March 9, 2016, in connection with Westinghouse's acquisition of WECTEC and pursuant to the settlement agreement described below, the guarantee of The Shaw Group Inc. was terminated. The guarantee of Toshiba Corporation remains in place. In the event of certain credit rating downgrades of any Vogtle Owner, such Vogtle Owner will be required to provide a letter of credit or other credit enhancement. Additionally, as a result of credit rating downgrades of Toshiba Corporation, Westinghouse provided the Vogtle Owners with letters of credit in an aggregate amount of   $920 million   in accordance with, and subject to adjustment under, the terms of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. 
  The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay certain termination costs. The Contractor may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4

Agreement under certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspension or delays of work, action by a governmental authority to permanently stop work, certain breaches of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement by the Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events. 
  In 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 each year. If the projected construction capital costs to be borne by Georgia Power increase by   5%   above the certified cost or the projected in-service dates are significantly extended, Georgia Power is required to seek an amendment to the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate from the Georgia PSC. In February 2013, Georgia Power requested an amendment to the certificate to increase the estimated in-service capital cost of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from   $4.4 billion   to   $4.8 billion   and to extend the estimated in-service dates to the fourth quarter 2017 (from April 2016) and the fourth quarter 2018 (from April 2017) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively. In October 2013, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation (2013 Stipulation) between Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC Staff to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3 or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia Power. 
  On April 15, 2015, the Georgia PSC issued a procedural order in connection with the twelfth VCM report, which included a requested amendment (Requested Amendment) to the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate to reflect the Contractor's revised forecast for completion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (second quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020, respectively) and to increase the estimated total in-service capital cost of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to   $5.0 billion  . Pursuant to the Georgia PSC's procedural order, the Georgia PSC deemed the Requested Amendment unnecessary and withdrawn until the completion of construction of Plant Vogtle Unit 3 consistent with the 2013 Stipulation. The Georgia PSC recognized that the certified cost and the 2013 Stipulation do not constitute a cost recovery cap. In accordance with the Georgia Integrated Resource Planning Act, any costs incurred by Georgia Power in excess of the certified amount will be included in rate base, provided Georgia Power shows the costs to be reasonable and prudent. 
  On December 31, 2015, Westinghouse and the Vogtle Owners entered into a definitive settlement agreement (Contractor Settlement Agreement) to resolve disputes between the Vogtle Owners and the Contractor under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, including litigation that was pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia (Vogtle Construction Litigation). Effective December 31, 2015, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, and the Contractor entered into an amendment to the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement to implement the Contractor Settlement Agreement. The Contractor Settlement Agreement and the related amendment to the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement (i) restrict the Contractor's ability to seek further increases in the contract price by clarifying and limiting the circumstances that constitute nuclear regulatory changes in law; (ii) provide for enhanced dispute resolution procedures; (iii) revise the guaranteed substantial completion dates to match the current estimated in-service dates of June 30, 2019 for Unit 3 and June 30, 2020 for Unit 4; (iv) provide that delay liquidated damages will commence from the current estimated nuclear fuel loading date for each unit, which is December 31, 2018 for Unit 3 and December 31, 2019 for Unit 4; and (v) provide that Georgia Power, based on its ownership interest, will pay to the Contractor and capitalize to the project cost approximately   $350 million  , of which approximately   $256 million   had been paid as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, the Contractor Settlement Agreement provides for the resolution of other open existing items relating to the scope of the project under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, including cyber security, for which costs were reflected in Georgia Power's previously disclosed in-service cost estimate. Further, as part of the settlement and Westinghouse's acquisition of WECTEC: (i) Westinghouse engaged Fluor Enterprises, Inc., a subsidiary of Fluor Corporation, as a new construction subcontractor; and (ii) the Vogtle Owners, CB I, and The Shaw Group Inc. entered into mutual releases of any and all claims arising out of events or circumstances in connection with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 that occurred on or before the date of the Contractor Settlement Agreement. On January 5, 2016, the Vogtle Construction Litigation was dismissed with prejudice. 
  The Georgia PSC has approved fourteen VCM reports covering the periods through December 31, 2015, including construction capital costs incurred, which through that date totaled $3.3 billion. On January 21, 2016, Georgia Power submitted the Contractor Settlement Agreement and the related amendment to the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement

to the Georgia PSC for its review. In accordance with the Georgia PSC's subsequent order, on April 5, 2016, Georgia Power filed supplemental information in support of the Contractor Settlement Agreement and Georgia Power's position that all construction costs to date have been prudently incurred and that the current estimated in-service capital cost and schedule are reasonable. 
  On October 20, 2016, Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC Staff entered into a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving the following prudence matters: (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM report will be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement is reasonable and prudent and none of the amounts paid or to be paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) financing costs on verified and approved capital costs will be deemed prudent provided they are incurred prior to December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively; and (iv) (a) the in-service capital cost forecast will be adjusted to $5.680 billion (Revised Forecast), which includes a contingency of $240 million above Georgia Power's current forecast of $5.440 billion, (b) capital costs incurred up to the Revised Forecast will be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, and (c) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above the Revised Forecast are reasonable and prudent. Under the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, the certified in-service capital cost for purposes of calculating the NCCR tariff will remain at $4.418 billion. Construction capital costs above $4.418 billion will accrue AFUDC through commercial operation. The ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be reduced from 10.95% (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013 ARP) to 10.00% effective January 1, 2016. For purposes of the AFUDC calculation, the ROE on costs between $4.418 billion and $5.440 billion will also be 10.00% and the ROE on any amounts above $5.440 billion would be Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt. If the Georgia PSC adjusts Georgia Power's ROE rate setting point in a rate case prior to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 being placed into retail rate base, then the ROE for purposes of calculating both the NCCR tariff and AFUDC will likewise be 95 basis points lower than the revised ROE rate setting point. If Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by December 31, 2020, then (i) the ROE for purposes of calculating the NCCR tariff will be reduced an additional 300 basis points, and may, at the Georgia PSC's discretion, be accrued to be used for the benefit of customers, until such time as the units reach commercial operation and (ii) the ROE used to calculate AFUDC will be Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt. 
  Under the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will be placed into retail rate base on December 31, 2020 or upon reaching commercial operation, whichever is later. The Georgia PSC will determine for retail ratemaking purposes the process of transitioning Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from a construction project to an operating plant no later than Georgia Power's base rate case required to be filed by July 1, 2019. 
  The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement is subject to approval by the Georgia PSC, which is scheduled to vote on this matter on December 20, 2016. Accordingly, the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement are subject to change and the terms of any final agreement approved by the Georgia PSC may differ materially from the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. If approved, the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement is expected to reduce Georgia Power's revenues for the years 2016 through 2020 by a total of approximately $325 million ($115 million reduction in net income). 
  On August 31, 2016, Georgia Power filed the fifteenth VCM report with the Georgia PSC covering the period from January 1 through June 30, 2016 requesting approval of   $141 million   of construction capital costs incurred during that period. Georgia Power's CWIP balance for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 was   $3.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . Estimated financing costs during the construction period total approximately   $2.4 billion  , of which   $1.2 billion   had been incurred through   September 30, 2016  . 
  On November 1, 2016, Georgia Power submitted its 2017 NCCR tariff filing requesting that the current NCCR tariff rate remain effective for 2017 if the Georgia PSC approves the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. As required under the current order, Georgia Power concurrently submitted a 2017 NCCR tariff rate calculated using the current authorized 10.95% ROE, which would result in an increase of approximately $70 million.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, at the federal and state level, and additional challenges may arise as construction proceeds. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise as construction proceeds, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs either to the Vogtle Owners or the Contractor or to both. 
  As construction continues, the risk remains that challenges with Contractor performance including labor productivity, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and installation of plant systems, structures, and components, or other issues could arise and may further impact project schedule and cost. Contractor performance and progress in recent months, primarily associated with Unit 3, has resulted in additional current schedule pressure of approximately three to four months and has increased the likelihood of further schedule impacts to that unit. Georgia Power expects the Contractor to employ mitigation efforts to maintain the current project schedule and believes the Contractor is responsible for any related costs under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. Should Unit 3 be placed in service after June 2019, Georgia Power estimates its financing costs to be approximately $22 million per month. Additionally, Georgia Power estimates its owner's costs to be approximately $2 million per month, net of delay liquidated damages and certain incentive payments that would no longer be required to be paid per the Contractor Settlement Agreement. The Contractor's progress on Unit 4 indicates that the current estimated in-service date of June 2020 remains achievable. In addition, the IRS has allocated production tax credits to each of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which require the applicable unit to be placed in service before 2021. 
  Future claims by the Contractor or Georgia Power (on behalf of the Vogtle Owners) could arise throughout construction. These claims may be resolved through formal and informal dispute resolution procedures under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement and, under the enhanced dispute resolution procedures, may be resolved through litigation after the completion of nuclear fuel load for both units. 
  See RISK FACTORS of Georgia Power in Item 1A of the Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks associated with the licensing, construction, and operation of nuclear generating units, including potential impacts that could result from a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world. 
  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Other Matters 
  Georgia Power is   involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition,   Georgia Power is   subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.   Georgia Power's   business activities   are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as regulation of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, such as air quality and water standards, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO   2    and other emissions  , CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. 
  The     ultimate     outcome     of     such     pending     or     potential     litigation     against     Georgia Power     cannot     be     predicted     at     this     time;     however,     for     current     proceedings     not     specifically     reported     in     Note     (B)     to     the     Condensed     Financial     Statements     herein     or     in     Note     3     to     the     financial     statements     of     Georgia Power     in     Item     8     of     the Form 10-K,     management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on   Georgia Power's   financial statements.

of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential. 
  Georgia Power regularly evaluates its operations and costs. Primarily in response to changing customer expectations and payment patterns, including electronic payments and alternative payment locations, and on-going efforts to increase overall operating efficiencies, Georgia Power initiated cost containment activities throughout the enterprise in July 2016, including the announced closure of 104 local offices and an employee attrition plan affecting approximately 300 positions. Charges associated with the cost containment activities are not expected to have a material impact on Georgia Power's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The cost containment activities are expected to reduce operating costs in 2017. 
  ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Georgia Power prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the financial statements of Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Georgia Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   ACCOUNTING POLICIES   "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a complete discussion of Georgia Power's critical accounting policies and estimates related to Electric Utility Regulation, Asset Retirement Obligations, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, and Contingent Obligations. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases     (Topic 842)   (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged  .   ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.   Georgia Power is   currently evaluating the new standard and has not yet determined its ultimate impact; however, adoption of ASU 2016-02 is expected to have a significant impact on   Georgia Power's   balance sheet. 
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation     (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 changes the accounting for income taxes and the cash flow presentation for share-based payment award transactions. Most significantly, entities are required to recognize all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock compensation as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.   Georgia Power   currently recognizes any excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise and vesting of stock compensation as additional paid-in capital. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and   Georgia Power   intends to adopt the ASU in the fourth quarter 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of   Georgia Power.

  Net cash provided from operating activities totaled   $2.26 billion   for the first   nine months of 2016   compared to   $2.16 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to the timing of vendor payments. Net cash used for investing activities totaled   $1.76 billion   for the first   nine months of 2016   compared to   $1.39 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015   primarily related to installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards and construction of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Net cash used for financing activities totaled   $522 million   for the first   nine months of 2016   compared to   $711 million   in the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease in cash used for financing activities is primarily due to higher capital contributions received from Southern Company and senior note issuances, partially offset by higher common stock dividends and lower borrowings from the FFB for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Cash flows from financing activities vary from period to period based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities. 
  Significant balance sheet changes for the first   nine months of 2016   include an increase in property, plant, and equipment of   $1.1 billion   to comply with environmental standards and construction of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and increases in current and deferred ARO liabilities of   $638 million   and other regulatory assets, deferred of   $378 million   primarily related to changes in ash pond closure strategy. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Environmental Matters       Environmental Statutes and Regulations       Coal Combustion Residuals  " herein for additional information regarding changes in ash pond closure strategy. 
  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a description of Georgia Power's capital requirements for its construction program, including estimated capital expenditures for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and to comply with existing environmental statutes and regulations, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as related interest, derivative obligations, preferred and preference stock dividends, leases, purchase commitments, and trust funding requirements. Approximately   $458 million   will be required through   September 30, 2017   to fund maturities of long-term debt. See "  Sources of Capital  " herein for additional information. 
  Georgia Power's construction program is currently estimated to total $2.6 billion for 2017, $2.7 billion for 2018, $2.3 billion for 2019, $2.2 billion for 2020, and $1.8 billion for 2021. These amounts include expenditures of approximately $0.6 billion for 2017, $0.7 billion for 2018, $0.4 billion for 2019, and $0.1 billion for 2020 to continue and complete construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. These estimated expenditures do not include potential compliance costs that may arise from the EPA's final rules and guidelines or subsequently approved state plans that would limit CO   2    emissions from existing, new, modified, or reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. 
  The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Georgia PSC approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Georgia Power       Nuclear Construction  " herein for information regarding additional factors that may impact construction expenditures.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Sources of Capital 
  Except as described below with respect to the DOE loan guarantees, Georgia Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, short-term debt, external security issuances, term loans, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions, and other factors. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Sources of Capital" of Georgia Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  In addition, Georgia Power may make borrowings through a loan guarantee agreement (Loan Guarantee Agreement) between Georgia Power and the DOE, the proceeds of which may be used to reimburse Georgia Power for Eligible Project Costs incurred in connection with its construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Under the Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee borrowings of up to $3.46 billion (not to exceed 70% of Eligible Project Costs) to be made by Georgia Power under a multi-advance credit facility (FFB Credit Facility) among Georgia Power, the DOE, and the FFB. Eligible Project Costs incurred through   September 30, 2016   would allow for borrowings of up to   $2.6 billion   under the FFB Credit Facility, of which Georgia Power has borrowed   $2.5 billion  . See Note 6 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Loan Guarantee Agreement and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Georgia Power       Nuclear Construction  " herein for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Georgia Power's current liabilities exceeded current assets by   $656 million   primarily due to scheduled maturities of long-term debt. Georgia Power intends to utilize operating cash flows, as well as FFB borrowings, commercial paper, lines of credit, bank notes, and external securities issuances, as market conditions permit, and equity contributions from Southern Company to fund its short-term capital needs. Georgia Power has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to the capital markets and financial institutions to meet liquidity needs. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Georgia Power had approximately   $47 million   of cash and cash equivalents. Georgia Power's committed credit arrangement with banks at   September 30, 2016   was   $1.75 billion   of which   $1.73 billion   was unused. This credit arrangement expires in 2020. 
  This bank credit arrangement contains a covenant that limits debt levels and contains a cross acceleration provision to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) of Georgia Power. Such cross acceleration provision to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Georgia Power defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Georgia Power is currently in compliance with this covenant. This bank credit arrangement does not contain a material adverse change clause at the time of borrowing. 
  Subject to applicable market conditions, Georgia Power expects to renew or replace this credit arrangement, as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Georgia Power may extend the maturity date and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 
  See Note 6 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Bank Credit Arrangements" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Bank Credit Arrangements  " herein for additional information. 
  A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to Georgia Power's pollution control revenue bonds and commercial paper program. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $868 million  . In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , Georgia Power had   $250 million   of fixed rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding that were required to be reoffered within the next 12 months. 
  Georgia Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of Georgia Power and the other traditional electric operating

    Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the   three  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
     Georgia Power believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing commercial paper programs, lines of credit, short-term bank notes, and operating cash flows. 
  Credit Rating Risk 
  Georgia Power does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. 
  There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, and construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
  The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 
                     Credit Ratings

Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company system power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Georgia Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so. 
  Financing Activities 
  In January 2016, $4.085 million aggregate principal amount of Savannah Economic Development Authority Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Savannah Electric and Power Company Project), First Series 1993 matured. 
  In March 2016, Georgia Power issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2016A 3.25% Senior Notes due April 1, 2026 and $325 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2016B 2.40% Senior Notes due April 1, 2021. An amount equal to the proceeds from the Series 2016A 3.25% Senior Notes due April 1, 2026 will be allocated to eligible green expenditures, including financing of or investments in solar generating facilities or electric vehicle charging infrastructure, or payments under PPAs served by solar or wind generating facilities. The proceeds from the Series 2016B 2.40% Senior Notes due April 1, 2021 were used to repay at maturity $250 million aggregate principal amount of Georgia Power's Series 2013B Floating Rate Senior Notes due March 15, 2016, to

  In April 2016, Georgia Power's $250 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2011B 3.00% Senior Notes matured. 
  In June 2016, Georgia Power made additional borrowings under the FFB Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $300 million at a   2.571%   interest rate through the final maturity date of February 20, 2044. The proceeds were used to reimburse Georgia Power for Eligible Project Costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. 
  In August 2016, Georgia Power's $200 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2013C Floating Rate Senior Notes matured. 
  In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Georgia Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THIRD QUARTER 2016 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2015 
  AND 
  YEAR-TO-DATE 2016 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2015 

OVERVIEW 
  Gulf Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers within its traditional service territory located in northwest Florida and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. 
  Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Gulf Power's business of selling electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment, to maintain and grow energy sales, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, increasingly stringent environmental standards, reliability, restoration following major storms, and fuel. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Gulf Power for the foreseeable future. 
  Through 2015, long-term non-affiliate capacity sales from Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (205 MWs) provided the majority of Gulf Power's wholesale earnings.   The revenues from wholesale contracts covering 100% of this capacity represented 82% of wholesale capacity revenues in 2015. Following contract expirations at the end of 2015 and the end of May 2016, Gulf Power's remaining contracted sales from the unit cover approximately 24% of Gulf Power's ownership of the unit through 2019. The expiration of these contracts has had a material negative impact on Gulf Power's earnings in 2016. On May 5, 2016, Gulf Power delivered a letter to the Florida PSC requesting recognition of Gulf Power's ownership in Plant Scherer Unit 3 as being in service to retail customers when and as its existing wholesale contracts expire. As a result, on September 13, 2016, the Florida PSC instructed Gulf Power to file its monthly earnings surveillance reports both including and excluding its share of investment and expenses related to Plant Scherer Unit 3 that is not covered by contracts. 
  On October 12, 2016, Gulf Power filed a petition (2016 Rate Case) with the Florida PSC requesting an increase in retail rates and charges of $106.8 million based on the projected test year of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and a retail ROE of 11% compared to the current retail ROE of 10.25%.   The recoverability of the costs associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 will be decided in this matter. The Florida PSC is expected to make a decision on the 2016 Rate Case in the second quarter 2017. Gulf Power has requested that the increase in base rates, if approved by the Florida PSC, become effective in July 2017  . 
  On November 2, 2016, the Florida PSC approved Gulf Power's annual rate clause request for its cost recovery clause factors for 2017. The fuel and environmental factors include certain costs associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Cost Recovery Clauses  " herein for additional information. 
  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, if the recovery of Plant Scherer Unit 3 costs is not resolved through the 2016 Rate Case, it could continue to have a material negative impact on Gulf Power's earnings in future years until Gulf Power is able to find a suitable alternative related to this asset. 
  Gulf Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after dividends on preference stock. For additional information on these indicators, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       OVERVIEW       "Key Performance Indicators" of Gulf Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net Income 

Gulf Power's net income after dividends on preference stock for the   third quarter 2016   was   $45 million   compared to   $48 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to lower non-affiliated wholesale capacity revenues and an increase in depreciation, partially offset by an increase in retail revenues primarily due to warmer weather and lower operations and maintenance expenses. 
  Gulf Power's net income after dividends on preference stock for   year-to-date 2016   was   $108 million   compared to   $120 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to lower non-affiliated wholesale capacity revenues and an increase in depreciation, partially offset by lower operations and maintenance expenses. 
  Retail Revenues 

In the   third quarter 2016  , retail revenues were   $377 million   compared to   $363 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , retail revenues were   $978 million   compared to   $983 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . 
  Details of the changes in retail revenues were as follows: 

See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Retail Regulatory Matters" of Gulf Power in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under "Revenues" and Note 3 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Gulf Power's retail base rate case and cost recovery clauses, including Gulf Power's fuel cost recovery, purchased power capacity recovery, environmental cost recovery, and energy conservation cost recovery clauses. 
  Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the   third quarter   and   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding periods in   2015   primarily due to an increase in the environmental cost recovery clause rate, partially offset by a decrease in the energy conservation cost recovery clause rate, both effective in January 2016. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Cost Recovery Clauses  " herein for additional information.

  GULF POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased slightly in the   third quarter 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . For the   third quarter 2016  , weather-adjusted KWH sales to residential and commercial customers decreased 1.9% and 0.5%, respectively, due to lower customer usage primarily resulting from efficiency improvements in appliances and lighting, partially offset by customer growth. KWH sales to industrial customers increased 1.3% for the   third quarter 2016   primarily due to decreased customer co-generation and changes in customers' operations. 
  Revenues attributable to changes in sales remained essentially flat   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . Weather-adjusted KWH sales to residential and commercial customers decreased 0.4% and 1.0%, respectively, due to lower customer usage primarily resulting from efficiency improvements in appliances and lighting, partially offset by customer growth. KWH sales to industrial customers increased 2.9% primarily due to decreased customer co-generation, partially offset by changes in customers' operations. 
  Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased in the   third quarter 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  , primarily due to lower recoverable costs under Gulf Power's environmental cost recovery clause, partially offset by higher recoverable costs under Gulf Power's energy conservation cost recovery clause. Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in fuel costs as a result of decreased generation and lower purchased power energy costs. Lower recoverable costs under Gulf Power's environmental cost recovery clause, partially offset by higher recoverable costs under Gulf Power's energy conservation cost recovery clause, also contributed to this decrease. Fuel and other cost recovery provisions include fuel expenses, the energy component of purchased power costs, purchased power capacity costs, and the difference between projected and actual costs and revenues related to energy conservation and environmental compliance. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Cost Recovery Clauses   Retail Fuel Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Wholesale Revenues   Non-Affiliates 

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of long-term sales agreements to other utilities in Florida and Georgia and short-term opportunity sales. Capacity revenues from long-term sales agreements represent the greatest contribution to net income. The energy is generally sold at variable cost. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Gulf Power's variable cost of energy. Wholesale energy revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Gulf Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were   $17 million   compared to   $30 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were   $48 million   compared to   $82 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . These decreases were primarily due to a 62.1% and 52.3% decrease in capacity revenues for the   third   quarter and   year-to-date 2016  , respectively, resulting from the expiration of Plant Scherer Unit 3 long-term sales agreements.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Wholesale Revenues   Affiliates 

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the revenue related to these energy sales generally offsets the cost of energy sold. 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were   $23 million   compared to   $17 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a 42.8% increase in KWH sales as a result of higher sales to the power pool due to greater Southern Company system load. For   year-to-date 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were   $59 million   compared to   $52 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a 33.7% increase in KWH sales resulting from lower planned unit outages for Gulf Power's generation resources. 
  Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 

In the   third quarter 2016  , total fuel and purchased power expenses were   $177 million   compared to   $173 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $7 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased as a result of higher customer loads on Gulf Power's system, partially offset by a $3 million decrease in the average cost of fuel and purchased power. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , total fuel and purchased power expenses were   $446 million   compared to   $473 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily the result of a $40 million decrease due to the lower average cost of fuel and purchased power, partially offset by a $13 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs purchased from Gulf Power's gas-fired PPA resource. 
  Fuel and purchased power transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy and capacity expenses are generally offset by energy and capacity revenues through Gulf Power's fuel and purchased power capacity cost recovery clauses and long-term wholesale contracts. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Cost Recovery Clauses   Retail Fuel Cost Recovery" and "   Purchased Power Capacity Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Details of Gulf Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 

(*) 
    Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by Gulf Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider. 
     Fuel 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , fuel expense was   $141 million   compared to   $143 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a 12.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by Gulf Power's gas-fired generation resources due to higher planned maintenance and a 2.3% decrease in the average cost of fuel. The decreases were partially offset by a 3.6% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by Gulf Power's coal-fired generation resources. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , fuel expense was   $342 million   compared to   $375 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a 17.4% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by Gulf Power's coal-fired generation resources due to the lower cost of gas-fired resources and a 2.5% decrease in the average cost of fuel. The decreases were partially offset by a 0.5% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by Gulf Power's gas-fired generation resources. 
  Purchased Power   Non-Affiliates 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , purchased power expense from non-affiliates was   $33 million   compared to   $26 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a 26.5% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of lower cost energy, partially offset by a 6.6% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased due to lower energy costs from gas-fired resources. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , purchased power expense from non-affiliates was   $95 million   compared to   $76 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a 46.6% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of lower cost energy, partially offset by a 21.0% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased due to lower energy costs from gas-fired resources. 
  Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. 
  Purchased Power   Affiliates 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , purchased power expense from affiliates was   $3 million   compared to   $4 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a 54.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased due to an increase in coal-fired Gulf Power generation committed to serve territorial loads, partially offset by a 67.4% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher power pool interchange rates.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

For   year-to-date 2016  , purchased power expense from affiliates was   $9 million   compared to   $22 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a 54.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased due to lower territorial loads and a 10.8% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased due to lower power pool interchange rates as a result of lower fuel prices and lower off-peak energy prices of renewable market resources. 
  Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the FERC. 
  Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 

In the   third quarter 2016  , other operations and maintenance expenses were   $86 million   compared to   $90 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , other operations and maintenance expenses were   $239 million   compared to   $274 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . These decreases were primarily due to decreases in routine and planned maintenance expenses at generating facilities and lower expenses related to marketing programs. 
  Expenses from marketing programs do not have a significant impact on earnings since they are generally offset by energy conservation revenues through Gulf Power's energy conservation cost recovery clause. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 

In the   third quarter 2016  , depreciation and amortization was   $49 million   compared to   $40 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , depreciation and amortization was   $129 million   compared to   $100 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to $7 million and $20 million less of a reduction in depreciation, as authorized in a settlement agreement approved by the Florida PSC in 2013 (2013 Rate Case Settlement Agreement), in the third quarter and   year-to-date 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  . In the   third quarter 2016  , and in accordance with the 2013 Rate Case Settlement Agreement, Gulf Power reversed reductions previously recorded to depreciation. As a result, for the first   nine months of 2016  , the net reduction in depreciation was zero. Also contributing to the increases were property additions at generation, transmission, and distribution facilities placed in service in 2015.

  In the   third quarter 2016  ,   other income (expense), net was   $(2) million   compared to   $2 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , other income (expense), net was   $(4) million   compared to   $8 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . These changes were primarily due to lower AFUDC related to environmental control projects at generating facilities and transmission projects placed in service in   2015  . 
   
  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 
  The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of Gulf Power's future earnings potential. The level of Gulf Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Gulf Power's business of selling electricity. These factors include Gulf Power's ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that continues to allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining and growing sales which are subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, the rate of economic growth or decline in Gulf Power's service territory, the successful remarketing of wholesale capacity as current contracts expire, and the outcome of the 2016 Rate Case related to Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by economic growth. The pace of economic growth and electricity demand may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. For additional information relating to these issues, see RISK FACTORS in Item 1A and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL of Gulf Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
  Environmental Matters 
  Compliance costs related to federal and state environmental statutes and regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in retail rates or through long-term wholesale agreements on a timely basis or through market-based contracts. The State of Florida has statutory provisions that allow a utility to petition the Florida PSC for recovery of prudent environmental compliance costs that are not being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. Gulf Power's current long-term wholesale agreements contain provisions that permit charging the customer with costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations. The full impact of any such regulatory or legislative changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are completed. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates or long-term wholesale agreements could contribute to reduced demand for electricity as well as impact the cost competitiveness of wholesale capacity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Environmental Matters," "Retail Regulatory Matters   Cost Recovery Clauses   Environmental Cost Recovery," and "Other Matters" of Gulf Power in Item 7 and Note 3 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under "Environmental Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations 
  Air Quality 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Environmental Matters       Environmental Statutes and Regulations       Air Quality" of   Gulf Power   in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the EPA's final MATS rule, regional haze regulations,   fine particulate matter National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS),   and the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). 
  On April 25, 2016, in response to a June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court opinion, the EPA published its supplemental finding regarding consideration of costs in support of the MATS rule. This finding does not impact MATS rule compliance requirements, costs, or deadlines, and   all Gulf Power units   that are subject to the MATS rule completed the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the MATS rule by the applicable deadlines. 
  Also on April 25, 2016, the EPA issued proposed revisions to the regional haze regulations. The ultimate impact of the proposed revisions will depend on their ultimate adoption, implementation, and any legal challenges and cannot be determined at this time. 
  On   September 6, 2016, the EPA designated all remaining areas within   Gulf Power's service territory   as attainment for the 2012 annual fine particulate matter NAAQS. 
  On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates the CSAPR ozone season nitrogen oxide program, including revising ozone-season emissions budgets in   Mississippi and removing Florida from the CSAPR program  . The ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of any legal challenges and implementation at the state level and cannot be determined at this time. 
  Retail Regulatory Matters 
  Gulf Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Florida PSC. Gulf Power's rates are a combination of base rates and several separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs. These separate cost recovery clauses address such items as fuel and purchased energy costs, purchased power capacity costs, energy conservation and demand side management programs, and the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery clauses are recovered through base rates. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Gulf Power's wholesale business consists of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Gulf Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from Gulf Power resources. The second type, referred to as a unit sale, is a wholesale customer purchase from a dedicated generating plant unit where a portion of that unit is reserved for the customer. These agreements are associated with Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 and consist of both capacity and energy sales. Through 2015, long-term non-affiliate capacity sales from Gulf Power's ownership of the unit provided the majority of Gulf Power's wholesale earnings.   The revenues from wholesale contracts covering 100% of this capacity represented 82% of wholesale capacity revenues in 2015. Following contract expirations at the end of 2015 and the end of May 2016, Gulf Power's remaining contracted sales from the unit cover approximately 24% of Gulf Power's ownership of the unit through 2019. The expiration of these contracts has had a material negative impact on Gulf Power's earnings in 2016. On May 5, 2016, Gulf Power delivered a letter to the Florida PSC requesting recognition of Gulf Power's ownership in Plant Scherer Unit 3 as being in service to retail customers when and as its existing wholesale contracts expire. As a result, on September 13, 2016, the Florida PSC instructed Gulf Power to file its monthly earnings surveillance reports both including and excluding its share of investment and expenses related to Plant Scherer Unit 3 that is not covered by contracts.   See "  Retail Base Rate Cases  " and "  Cost Recovery Clauses  " herein for additional information.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. However, if the recovery of Plant Scherer Unit 3 costs is not resolved through the 2016 Rate Case, it could continue to have a material negative impact on Gulf Power's earnings in future years until Gulf Power is able to find a suitable alternative related to this asset. 
  Retail Base Rate Cases 
  The 2013 Rate Case Settlement Agreement authorized Gulf Power to reduce depreciation and record a regulatory asset up to $62.5 million from January 2014 through June 2017. In any given month, such depreciation reduction may not exceed the amount necessary for the retail ROE, as reported to the Florida PSC monthly, to reach the midpoint of the authorized retail ROE range then in effect. For 2014 and 2015, Gulf Power recognized reductions in depreciation of $8.4 million and $20.1 million, respectively. In the   third quarter 2016   and in accordance with the 2013 Rate Case Settlement Agreement, Gulf Power reversed reductions previously recorded to depreciation. As a result, for the first   nine months of 2016  , the net reduction in depreciation was zero. 
  On October 12, 2016, Gulf Power filed the 2016 Rate Case with the Florida PSC requesting an increase in retail rates and charges of $106.8 million based on the projected test year of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and a retail ROE of 11% compared to the current retail ROE of 10.25%.   The recoverability of the costs associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 will be decided in this matter. The Florida PSC is expected to make a decision on the 2016 Rate Case in the second quarter 2017. Gulf Power has requested that the increase in base rates, if approved by the Florida PSC, become effective in July 2017  . The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Cost Recovery Clauses 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Retail Regulatory Matters   Cost Recovery Clauses" of Gulf Power in Item 7 and Note 3 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Cost Recovery Clauses" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Gulf Power's recovery of retail costs through various regulatory clauses and accounting orders. Gulf Power has four regulatory clauses which are approved by the Florida PSC. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information. 
  O  n November 2, 2016, the Florida PSC approved Gulf Power's annual rate clause request for its fuel, purchased power capacity, environmental, and energy conservation cost recovery factors for 2017. The net effect of the approved changes is a $41 million decrease in annual revenues for 2017. In general, the decreased revenues will not have a significant impact on net income since most of the revenues will be offset by lower expenses. However, certain costs associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 were included in the environmental clause rate, which will have an impact of approximately $11 million and $14 million of additional revenue in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The final disposition of these costs, and the related impact on rates, is subject to the Florida PSC's ultimate ruling on whether costs associated with Plant Scherer Unit 3 are recoverable from retail customers, which is expected to be decided by the Florida PSC in the 2016 Rate Case as discussed previously  . The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Renewables 
  The Florida PSC issued a final approval order on Gulf Power's Community Solar Pilot Program on April 15, 2016. The program will offer all Gulf Power customers an opportunity to voluntarily contribute to the construction and operation of a solar photovoltaic facility with electric generating capacity of up to 1 MW through annual subscriptions. The energy generated from the solar facility is expected to provide power to all of Gulf Power's customers. 
  On October 11, 2016, the Florida PSC preliminarily approved an energy purchase agreement for up to 94 MWs of wind generation in central Oklahoma. Purchases under this agreement will be for energy only and will be recovered through Gulf Power's fuel cost recovery clause.

Other Matters 
  As a result of the cost to comply with environmental regulations imposed by the EPA, Gulf Power retired its coal-fired generation at Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 (357 MWs) on March 31, 2016. Gulf Power filed a petition with the Florida PSC requesting permission to recover the remaining net book value of Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 and the remaining materials and supplies associated with these units as of the retirement date. In connection with this request, Gulf Power reclassified approximately $63 million to a regulatory asset, including the remaining net book value of the units and the associated materials and supplies. On August 29, 2016, the Florida PSC approved Gulf Power's request to create a regulatory asset and defer the recovery over a period to be decided in the 2016 Rate Case. 
  Gulf Power is   involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition,   Gulf Power is   subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.   Gulf Power's   business activities   are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as regulation of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, such as air quality and water standards, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO   2    and other emissions  , CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. 
  The     ultimate     outcome     of     such     pending     or     potential     litigation     against     Gulf Power     cannot     be     predicted     at     this     time;     however,     for     current     proceedings     not     specifically     reported     in     Note     (B)     to     the     Condensed     Financial     Statements     herein     or     in     Note     3     to     the     financial     statements     of     Gulf Power     in     Item     8     of     the Form 10-K,     management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on   Gulf Power's   financial statements. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential. 
  ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Gulf Power prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the financial statements of Gulf Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Gulf Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   ACCOUNTING POLICIES   "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of Gulf Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a complete discussion of Gulf Power's critical accounting policies and estimates related to Electric Utility Regulation, Asset Retirement Obligations, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, and Contingent Obligations. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases     (Topic 842)   (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged  .   ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.   Gulf Power is   currently evaluating the new standard and has not yet determined its ultimate impact; however, adoption of ASU 2016-02 is expected to have a significant impact on   Gulf Power's   balance sheet. 
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation     (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 changes the accounting for income taxes and the cash flow presentation for share-based payment award transactions. Most

significantly, entities are required to recognize all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock compensation as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.   Gulf Power   currently recognizes any excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise and vesting of stock compensation as additional paid-in capital. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and   Gulf Power   intends to adopt the ASU in the fourth quarter 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of   Gulf Power. 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
  Overview 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Overview" of Gulf Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Gulf Power's financial condition remained stable at   September 30, 2016  . Gulf Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as bank credit agreements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations  ," "  Sources of Capital  ," and "  Financing Activities  " herein for additional information. 
  Net cash provided from operating activities totaled   $373 million   for the first   nine months of 2016   compared to   $411 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The $38 million decrease in net cash was primarily due to a decrease in wholesale capacity revenue, partially offset by a federal income tax refund. Net cash used for investing activities totaled   $127 million   in the first   nine months of 2016   primarily due to property additions to utility plant. Net cash used for financing activities totaled   $251 million   for the first   nine months of 2016   primarily due to the redemption of long-term debt, payment of common stock dividends, and a decrease in notes payable. Cash flows from financing activities vary from period to period based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities. 
  Significant balance sheet changes for the first   nine months of 2016   include decreases of $125 million in long-term debt due to a redemption and $109 million in net property, plant, and equipment primarily due to the retirement of Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 and an increase in accumulated provision for depreciation primarily due to environmental control projects at generating facilities and transmission projects placed in service in   2015  . 
  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" of Gulf Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a description of Gulf Power's capital requirements for its construction program, including estimated capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental statutes and regulations, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as related interest, leases, derivative obligations, preference stock dividends, purchase commitments, and trust funding requirements. Approximately $195 million will be required through   September 30, 2017   to fund maturities of long-term debt. See "  Financing Activities  " herein for additional information. 
  Gulf Power's construction program is currently estimated to total $0.2 billion for 2017, $0.2 billion for 2018, $0.2 billion for 2019, $0.3 billion for 2020, and $0.3 billion for 2021. These estimated expenditures do not include potential compliance costs that may arise from the EPA's final rules and guidelines or subsequently approved state plans that would limit CO   2    emissions from existing, new, modified, or reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. 
  The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; storm impacts; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in the expected environmental compliance programs; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Florida PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the

cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. 
  Sources of Capital 
  Gulf Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, short-term debt, external security issuances, term loans, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions, and other factors. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Sources of Capital" of Gulf Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Gulf Power's current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. Gulf Power has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to the capital markets and financial institutions to meet short-term liquidity needs, including its commercial paper program which is supported by bank credit facilities. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Gulf Power had approximately   $69 million   of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

See Note 6 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under "Bank Credit Arrangements" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Bank Credit Arrangements  " herein for additional information. 
  Most of these bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of Gulf Power. Such cross acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Gulf Power defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Gulf Power is currently in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings. 
  Subject to applicable market conditions, Gulf Power expects to renew or replace its bank credit arrangements, as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Gulf Power may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 
  Most of the unused credit arrangements with banks are allocated to provide liquidity support to Gulf Power's pollution control revenue bonds and commercial paper program. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $82 million  . In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , Gulf Power had approximately   $21 million   of fixed rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding that were required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. 
  Gulf Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of Gulf Power and the other traditional electric operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of Gulf Power are loaned directly to Gulf Power. The obligations of each company under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support.

Details of short-term borrowings were as follows: 

(*) 
    Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the   three  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
     Gulf Power believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing the commercial paper program, lines of credit, short-term bank loans, and operating cash flows. 
  Credit Rating Risk 
  Gulf Power does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. 
  There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel transportation and storage, transmission, and energy price risk management. 
  The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 
                     Credit Ratings

    $ 
    192 
      
      Below BBB- and/or Baa3 
    $ 
    630 

Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company system power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Gulf Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so. 
  Market Price Risk 
  Gulf Power's market risk exposure relative to interest rate changes for the   third quarter   and   year-to-date 2016   has not changed materially compared to the December 31,   2015   reporting period. Gulf Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity with respect to its wholesale generating capacity had been limited because its long-term sales agreements shifted substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, Gulf Power is exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any wholesale generating capacity is uncontracted.

reports both including and excluding its share of investment and expenses related to Plant Scherer Unit 3 that is not covered by contracts. The recoverability of the costs associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 is expected to be decided in the 2016 Rate Case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Retail Regulatory Matters  " herein for additional information. 
  Financing Activities 
  In May 2016, Gulf Power redeemed $125 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2011A 5.75% Senior Notes due June 1, 2051. 
  Also in May 2016, Gulf Power entered into an 11-month floating rate bank loan bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR. This short-term loan was for $100 million aggregate principal amount and the proceeds were used to repay existing indebtedness and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
  In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements, contractual obligations, and storm recovery, Gulf Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

THIRD QUARTER 2016 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2015 
  AND 
  YEAR-TO-DATE 2016 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2015 

OVERVIEW 
  Mississippi Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers within its traditional service territory located within the State of Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. 
  Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Mississippi Power's business of selling electricity. These factors include Mississippi Power's ability to maintain and grow energy sales and to operate in a constructive regulatory environment that provides timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs. These costs include those related to the completion and operation of major construction projects, primarily the Kemper IGCC and the Plant Daniel scrubber project, projected long-term demand growth, reliability, fuel, and increasingly stringent environmental standards, as well as ongoing capital expenditures required for maintenance. Appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Mississippi Power for the foreseeable future. 
  In 2010, the Mississippi PSC issued a CPCN authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the Kemper IGCC. The certificated cost estimate of the Kemper IGCC established by the Mississippi PSC was $2.4 billion with a construction cost cap of $2.88 billion, net of $245 million of grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2 (Initial DOE Grants) and excluding the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO   2    pipeline facilities, AFUDC, and certain general exceptions, including change of law, force majeure, and beneficial capital (which exists when Mississippi Power demonstrates that the purpose and effect of the construction cost increase is to produce efficiencies that will result in a neutral or favorable effect on customers relative to the original proposal for the CPCN) (Cost Cap Exceptions). On April 8, 2016, Mississippi Power received approximately $137 million in additional grants from the DOE for the Kemper IGCC (Additional DOE Grants), which are expected to be used to reduce future rate impacts for customers. 
  Mississippi Power placed the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper IGCC in service in August 2014 and continues to progress towards completing the remainder of the Kemper IGCC, including the gasifiers and the gas clean-up facilities. The in-service date for the remainder of the Kemper IGCC is currently expected to occur by December 31, 2016. The initial production of syngas began on July 14, 2016 for gasifier "B" and on September 13, 2016 for gasifier "A." On October 11, 2016, the Kemper IGCC began testing using clean syngas from gasifier "A" and the related gas clean-up systems to produce electricity. On November 2, 2016, Mississippi Power determined a maintenance outage of gasifier "A" is needed to make improvements to the ash removal systems. The remaining schedule reflects the time expected to achieve production of electricity using gasifier "B," complete gasifier "A" outage activities, and resume electricity production using gasifier "A," as well as to complete the integration of all systems necessary for both combustion turbines to simultaneously generate electricity with syngas. 
  Mississippi Power's current cost estimate for the Kemper IGCC in total is approximately   $6.82 billion  , which includes approximately   $5.52 billion   of costs subject to the construction cost cap and is net of the Additional DOE Grants. Mississippi Power does not intend to seek any rate recovery for any related costs that exceed the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for revisions to the cost estimate totaling   $88 million   (  $54 million   after tax) in the   third quarter 2016   and a total of   $222 million   ($  137 million   after tax)   for the nine months ended September 30,     2016  . Since 2012, in the aggregate, Mississippi Power has incurred charges of   $2.63 billion   (  $1.63 billion   after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through   September 30, 2016  .  
  In addition, during the start-up and commissioning process, Mississippi Power is identifying potential improvement projects that ultimately may be completed subsequent to placing the remainder of the Kemper IGCC in service. If  
  
   112

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

completed, such improvement projects would be expected to enhance plant performance, safety, and/or operations. The related potential costs have yet to be fully evaluated, have not been included in the current cost estimate, and may be subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap. Any further changes in the estimated costs of the Kemper IGCC subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions, will be reflected in Mississippi Power's statements of income and these changes could be material. 
  In December 2015, the Mississippi PSC issued an order (In-Service Asset Rate Order), based on a stipulation (2015 Stipulation) between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff (MPUS), authorizing rates that provide for the recovery of approximately $126 million annually related to Kemper IGCC assets previously placed in service. On July 27, 2016, the Mississippi Supreme Court (Court) dismissed Greenleaf CO   2    Solutions, LLC s (Greenleaf) motion for reconsideration of its previous decision to dismiss Greenleaf's appeal of the In-Service Asset Rate Order. 
  On August 17, 2016, the Mississippi PSC issued an order establishing a discovery docket to manage all filings related to the prudence of the Kemper IGCC. On October 3, 2016, Mississippi Power made a required compliance filing, which included a review and explanation of differences between the Kemper IGCC project estimate set forth in the 2010 CPCN proceeding and the most recent Kemper IGCC project estimate, as well as comparisons of current cost estimates and current expected plant operational parameters to the estimates presented in the 2010 CPCN proceedings for the first five years following the start of commercial operations. Certain costs, including operations and maintenance, are materially higher than the amounts presented in the CPCN proceedings. Additionally, while the current estimated operational availability estimates reflect ultimate results similar to those presented in the 2010 CPCN proceedings, the ramp up period for the current estimates reflects a lower starting point and a slower escalation rate. Mississippi Power expects the Mississippi PSC to address these issues in connection with its next rate request. 
  Mississippi Power anticipates that it will incur additional expenses in excess of current rates associated with operating the Kemper IGCC after it is placed in service until the Kemper IGCC cost recovery approach is finalized, which are expected to be material. Mississippi Power expects to request authority from the Mississippi PSC and the FERC to defer all Kemper IGCC costs incurred after the in-service date that cannot be capitalized, are not included in current rates, and are not required to be charged against earnings as a result of the $2.88 billion cost cap until such time as the Mississippi PSC completes its review and includes the resulting allowable costs in rates. Mississippi Power is required to file its next rate request with the Mississippi PSC related to cost recovery for the Kemper IGCC by June 3, 2017. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Southern Company and Mississippi Power are defendants in two lawsuits that allege improper disclosure of important facts about the Kemper IGCC. While Mississippi Power believes that these lawsuits are without merit, an adverse outcome could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, the SEC is conducting a formal investigation of Southern Company and Mississippi Power concerning the estimated costs and expected in-service date of the Kemper IGCC. Southern Company and Mississippi Power believe the investigation is focused primarily on periods subsequent to 2010 and on accounting matters, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting associated with the Kemper IGCC. 
  For additional information on the Kemper IGCC, see Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " and "Other Matters" and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein. 
  As of September 30, 2016, Mississippi Power's current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately $411 million primarily due to the $300 million in senior notes which matured on October 15, 2016, as well as $65 million in short-term debt. In addition, if the Kemper IGCC does not go into service by December 31, 2016, Mississippi Power would have to repay approximately $250 million of tax benefits received as a result of quarterly income tax estimates through September 30, 2016.

  MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Mississippi Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including the construction, start-up, and rate recovery of the Kemper IGCC. In recognition that Mississippi Power's long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers' needs, Mississippi Power's retail base rate mechanism, PEP, includes performance indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to Mississippi Power's allowed return. In addition to the PEP performance indicators, Mississippi Power focuses on other performance measures, including broader measures of customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after dividends on preferred stock. For additional information on these indicators, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OVERVIEW   "Key Performance Indicators" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net Income 

N/M - Not meaningful 
  Mississippi Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the   third quarter 2016   was   $26 million   compared to a net loss of   $21 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily related to lower pre-tax charges of $88 million ($54 million after tax) in the   third quarter 2016   compared to pre-tax charges of $150 million ($93 million after tax) in the   third quarter 2015   for revisions of the estimated costs expected to be incurred on Mississippi Power's construction of the Kemper IGCC above the $2.88 billion cost cap established by the Mississippi PSC, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. The increase in net income was also due to an increase in retail revenues and a decrease in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in other operations and maintenance expenses. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , net income after dividends on preferred stock was   $39 million   compared to   $62 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in interest on deposits in 2015 resulting from the termination of an asset purchase agreement between Mississippi Power and SMEPA in May 2015, higher depreciation and amortization, and higher pre-tax charges of $222 million ($137 million after tax) in 2016 compared to pre-tax charges of $182 million ($112 million after tax) in 2015 for revisions of the estimated costs expected to be incurred on Mississippi Power's construction of the Kemper IGCC above the $2.88 billion cost cap established by the Mississippi PSC, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. The decrease in net income was partially offset by an increase in retail revenues. 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information. 
  Retail Revenues 

In the   third quarter 2016  , retail revenues were   $263 million   compared to   $244 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , retail revenues were   $652 million   compared to   $601 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  .

  MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Details of the changes in retail revenues were as follows: 

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing increased in the   third quarter   and   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding periods in   2015  , primarily due to the implementation of rates for certain Kemper IGCC in-service assets. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle   Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information. 
  Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in the   third quarter 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . Weather-adjusted KWH sales to residential and commercial customers decreased 6.7% and 0.9%, respectively, in the   third quarter 2016   due to decreased customer usage primarily resulting from efficiency improvements in residential appliances and lighting, partially offset by customer growth. KWH sales to industrial customers decreased 1.7% in the   third quarter 2016   primarily due to an unplanned outage by a large customer. 
  Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased for   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . Weather-adjusted KWH sales to residential and commercial customers decreased 2.6% and 1.5%, respectively, due to decreased customer usage primarily resulting from efficiency improvements in residential appliances and lighting, partially offset by customer growth. KWH sales to industrial customers decreased 0.7% primarily due to an unplanned outage by a large customer. 
  In the first quarter 2015, Mississippi Power updated the methodology to estimate the unbilled revenue allocation among customer classes. This change did not have a significant impact on net income. The KWH sales variances discussed above reflect an adjustment to the estimated allocation of Mississippi Power's unbilled first quarter 2015 KWH sales among customer classes that is consistent with the actual allocation in 2016. Without this adjustment,   year-to-date 2016   weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 0.8%, weather-adjusted KWH sales to commercial customers increased 0.6%, and KWH sales to industrial customers were relatively flat as compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . 
  Fuel and other cost recovery revenues increased in the   third quarter 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in   2015  , primarily as a result of revised ECO Plan rates which became effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016, partially offset by lower recoverable fuel costs. Fuel and other cost recovery revenues decreased for   year-to-date 2016   when compared to the corresponding period in 2015, primarily as a result of lower recoverable fuel costs, partially offset by revised ECO Plan rates which became effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016. See "  Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses  " herein for additional information. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power expenses reduced by the fuel portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income.

Wholesale Revenues   Non-Affiliates 

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "FERC Matters" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K and   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  FERC Matters  " herein for additional information. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates were   $198 million   compared to   $216 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a $16 million decrease in energy revenues primarily resulting from lower natural gas prices and decreased usage primarily resulting from milder weather. 
  Wholesale Revenues   Affiliates 

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost. 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were   $7 million   compared to   $18 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was due to a decrease in KWH sales primarily due to availability of lower cost alternatives. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates were   $23 million   compared to   $63 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was due to a $35 million decrease in KWH sales primarily due to availability of lower cost alternatives and a $5 million decrease associated with lower natural gas prices.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses    

N/M - Not meaningful 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , total fuel and purchased power expenses were   $120 million   compared to   $132 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a net decrease in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased primarily due to a decrease in non-territorial sales. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , total fuel and purchased power expenses were   $286 million   compared to   $370 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was due to a $49 million net decrease in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased primarily due to a decrease in non-territorial sales and milder weather and a $35 million decrease due to lower natural gas prices. 
  Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clause. 
  Details of Mississippi Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 

Fuel 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , fuel expense was   $112 million   compared to   $130 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was due to a 10.2% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated primarily as a result of lower wholesale sales and a 4.8% decrease in the average cost of fuel per KWH generated primarily due to a 2.7% lower cost of natural gas. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , total fuel expense was   $268 million   compared to   $359 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was due to a 12.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated primarily as a result of lower wholesale sales and a 14.2% decrease in the average cost of fuel per KWH generated primarily due to a 13.6% lower cost of natural gas.

  MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Purchased Power - Non-Affiliates 
  For year-to-date 2016, purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $4 million compared to $5 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a 43.1% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased due to lower energy costs from available gas-fired resources, partially offset by a 49.0% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of lower cost energy. 
  Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. 
  Purchased Power - Affiliates 
  In the third quarter 2016, purchased power expense from affiliates was $5 million compared to $1 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a 234.7% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of lower cost energy as compared to self-generation fuel cost and a 9.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher power pool interchange rates associated with higher natural gas prices. 
  For year-to-date 2016, purchased power expense from affiliates was $14 million compared to $6 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to a 163.8% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of lower cost energy as compared to self-generation fuel cost, partially offset by a 5.9% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased due to lower power pool interchange rates as a result of lower fuel prices. 
  Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC. 
  Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 

In the   third quarter 2016  , other operations and maintenance expenses were   $74 million   compared to   $63 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $7 million increase in maintenance expenses related to the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper IGCC that Mississippi Power began recognizing in connection with interim rates associated with the Kemper IGCC in-service assets implemented in September 2015 and a $4 million increase in transmission and distribution overhead line maintenance and vegetation management expenses. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , other operations and maintenance expenses were   $211 million   compared to   $206 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $23 million increase in maintenance expenses related to the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper IGCC that Mississippi Power began recognizing in connection with interim rates associated with the Kemper IGCC in-service assets implemented in September 2015, partially offset by a $15 million decrease in generation outage costs and a $4 million decrease primarily related to pension costs. 
  See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle       Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs       2015 Rate Case  " and "     Regulatory Assets and Liabilities  " herein for additional information.

Depreciation and Amortization 

In the   third quarter 2016  , depreciation and amortization was   $30 million   compared to   $38 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a $17 million deferral associated with the implementation of revised ECO Plan rates with the first billing cycle for September 2016, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of $9 million primarily related to the In-Service Asset Rate Order, ECO Plan, MATS rule compliance, and additional plant in service assets. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , depreciation and amortization was   $114 million   compared to   $95 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to additional regulatory asset amortization of $16 million related to the In-Service Asset Rate Order, ECO Plan, and MATS rule compliance, $12 million primarily due to Kemper IGCC deferrals, and $8 million of depreciation for additional plant in service assets, primarily the Plant Daniel scrubbers. These increases were partially offset by a $17 million deferral associated with the implementation of revised ECO Plan rates with the first billing cycle for September 2016. 
  See Note 1 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Also, see Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Mississippi Power       Environmental Compliance Overview Plan  " and "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle       Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs       2015 Rate Case  " and "     Regulatory Assets and Liabilities  " herein for additional information. 
  Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 

In the   third   quarter   2016  , taxes other than income taxes were   $31 million   compared to   $24 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For year-to-date 2016, taxes other than income taxes were   $81 million   compared to   $71 million   for the corresponding period in 2015. The increases were primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes of $4 million and $6 million for the third quarter and year-to-date 2016, respectively, due to an increase in the assessed value of property as well as increases in franchise taxes of $3 million and $4 million for the third quarter and year-to-date 2016, respectively. 
  The retail portion of ad valorem taxes is recoverable under Mississippi Power's ad valorem tax cost recovery clause and, therefore, does not affect net income. 
  Estimated Loss on Kemper IGCC 

In the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , estimated probable losses on the Kemper IGCC of   $88 million   and   $150 million  , respectively, were recorded at Mississippi Power. For   year-to-date 2016   and   year-to-date 2015  , estimated probable losses on the Kemper IGCC of   $222 million   and   $182 million  , respectively, were recorded at Mississippi Power. These losses reflect revisions of estimated costs expected to be incurred on the construction of the Kemper

  Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction 

In the   third   quarter of   2016  , AFUDC equity was   $31 million   compared to   $29 million   for the corresponding period in 2015. For   year-to-date 2016  , AFUDC equity was   $90 million   compared to   $82 million   for the corresponding period in 2015. The increases were driven by a higher AFUDC rate and an increase in Kemper IGCC CWIP subject to AFUDC, partially offset by placing the Plant Daniel scrubbers in service in November 2015. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "FERC Matters" and "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  FERC Matters  " and "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information regarding the Kemper IGCC. 
  Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized 

N/M - Not meaningful 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was   $15 million   compared to   $13 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was related to additional long-term debt and a decrease in amounts capitalized, partially offset by a decrease in interest accrued on the Mirror CWIP liability prior to refund. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was   $46 million   compared to $(6) million for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $31 million decrease in interest on deposits in 2015 resulting from the termination of an asset purchase agreement between Mississippi Power and SMEPA in May 2015. In addition, the increase was related to additional long-term debt and a decrease in amounts capitalized, partially offset by a decrease in interest accrued on the Mirror CWIP liability prior to refund. 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information on the Mirror CWIP refund. 
  Income Taxes (Benefit) 

N/M - Not meaningful 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , income tax benefit was   $(2) million   compared to   $(31) million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The change was primarily due to the reduction in the estimated probable losses on construction of the Kemper IGCC.

For   year-to-date 2016  , income tax benefit was   $(29) million   compared to   $(11) million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The change was primarily due to the increase in the estimated probable losses on construction of the Kemper IGCC. 
  See Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information. 
   
  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 
  The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of Mississippi Power's future earnings potential. The level of Mississippi Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Mississippi Power's business of selling electricity. These factors include Mississippi Power's ability to recover its prudently-incurred costs in a timely manner during a time of increasing costs, its ability to prevail against legal challenges associated with the Kemper IGCC, and the completion and subsequent operation of the Kemper IGCC in accordance with any operational parameters that may be adopted by the Mississippi PSC, as well as other ongoing construction projects. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining and growing sales which are subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with other utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Mississippi Power's service territory. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by economic growth. The pace of economic growth and electricity demand may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. For additional information relating to these issues, see RISK FACTORS in Item 1A and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL of Mississippi Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
  Environmental Matters 
  Compliance costs related to federal and state environmental statutes and regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely basis or through market-based contracts. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. The timing, specific requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are completed. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Environmental Matters" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 and Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Environmental Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Environmental Statutes and Regulations 
  Air Quality 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Environmental Matters       Environmental Statutes and Regulations       Air Quality" of   Mississippi Power   in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the EPA's final MATS rule, regional haze regulations,   and the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). 
  On April 25, 2016, in response to a June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court opinion, the EPA published its supplemental finding regarding consideration of costs in support of the MATS rule. This finding does not impact MATS rule compliance requirements, costs, or deadlines, and   all Mississippi Power units   that are subject to the MATS rule completed the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the MATS rule by the applicable deadlines. 
  Also on April 25, 2016, the EPA issued proposed revisions to the regional haze regulations. The ultimate impact of the proposed revisions will depend on their ultimate adoption, implementation, and any legal challenges and cannot be determined at this time.

On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates the CSAPR ozone season nitrogen oxide program, including revising ozone-season emissions budgets in   Alabama and Mississippi  . The ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of any legal challenges and implementation at the state level and cannot be determined at this time. 
  FERC Matters 
  Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "FERC Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding a settlement agreement entered into by Mississippi Power regarding the establishment of a regulatory asset for Kemper IGCC-related costs. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for information regarding Mississippi Power's construction of the Kemper IGCC. 
  On March 31, 2016, Mississippi Power reached a settlement agreement with its wholesale customers and filed a request with the FERC for an increase in wholesale base revenues under the Municipal and Rural Associations (MRA) cost-based electric tariff, primarily as a result of placing scrubbers for Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 in service in November 2015. The settlement agreement, accepted by the FERC, effective for services rendered beginning May 1, 2016, provides that base rates under the MRA cost-based electric tariff will produce additional annual base revenues of $7 million. Additionally, under the settlement agreement, the tariff customers agreed to similar regulatory treatment for MRA tariff ratemaking as the treatment approved for retail ratemaking under the In-Service Asset Rate Order. This regulatory treatment primarily includes (i) recovery of the Kemper IGCC assets currently operational and providing service to customers and other related costs, (ii) amortization of the Kemper IGCC-related regulatory assets included in rates under the settlement agreement over 36 months, (iii) Kemper IGCC-related expenses included in rates under the settlement agreement no longer being deferred and charged to expense, and (iv) removing all of the Kemper IGCC CWIP from rate base with a corresponding increase in accrual of AFUDC. The additional resulting AFUDC is estimated to be approximately $11 million through the Kemper IGCC's projected in-service date of December 31, 2016. 
  Fuel Cost Recovery 
  Mississippi Power has a wholesale MRA and a Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factor. Effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016, fuel rates decreased   $11 million   annually for wholesale MRA customers and   $1 million   annually for wholesale MB customers. 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "FERC Matters       Fuel Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Retail Regulatory Matters 
  Mississippi Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power's rates are a combination of base rates and several separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs. These separate cost recovery clauses address such items as fuel and purchased power, energy efficiency programs, ad valorem taxes, property damage, and the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery clauses are recovered through Mississippi Power's base rates. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters" and "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Retail Regulatory Matters       Mississippi Power  " and "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information.

Renewables 
  In November 2015, the Mississippi PSC issued orders approving three solar facilities for a combined total of approximately 105 MWs. Mississippi Power will purchase all of the energy produced by the solar facilities for the 25-year term under each of the three PPAs. The projects are expected to be in service by the second quarter 2017 and the resulting energy purchases are expected to be recovered through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. Mississippi Power may retire the renewable energy credits (REC) generated on behalf of its customers or sell the RECs, separately or bundled with energy, to third parties. 
  Energy Efficiency 
  On May 3, 2016, the Mississippi PSC issued an order approving the annual Energy Efficiency Cost Rider Compliance filing, which included an anticipated reduction of   $2 million   in retail revenues for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
  Performance Evaluation Plan 
  On April 1, 2016, Mississippi Power submitted its annual PEP lookback filing for 2015, which reflected the need for a   $5 million   surcharge to be recovered from customers. The filing has been suspended for review by the Mississippi PSC. 
  On July 12, 2016, Mississippi Power submitted its annual projected PEP filing for 2016 which indicated no change in rates. The filing has been suspended for review by the Mississippi PSC. 
  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Environmental Compliance Overview Plan 
  O  n August 17, 2016, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's revised ECO Plan filing for 2016, which requested the maximum 2% annual increase in revenues, approximately $18 million, primarily related to Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 scrubbers being placed in service in November 2015. The revised rates became effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016. Approximately $22 million of related revenue requirements in excess of the 2% maximum was deferred for inclusion in the 2017 filing  . 
  Fuel Cost Recovery 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the amount of over-recovered retail fuel costs included on the balance sheet was   $58 million   compared to   $71 million   at December 31, 2015. 
  The Mississippi PSC conditionally approved a decrease of $120 million annually in fuel cost recovery rates on January 5, 2016, effective with the first billing cycle for February 2016. On August 17, 2016, the Mississippi PSC approved an additional decrease of $51 million annually in fuel cost recovery rates effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016. 
  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding Mississippi Power's construction of the Kemper IGCC. 
  Kemper IGCC Overview 
  The Kemper IGCC will utilize an IGCC technology with an expected output capacity of   582   MWs. The Kemper IGCC will be fueled by locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal) from a mine owned by Mississippi Power and situated adjacent to the Kemper IGCC. The mine, operated by North American Coal Corporation, started commercial operation in 2013. In connection with the Kemper IGCC, Mississippi Power constructed and plans to operate approximately   61   miles of CO   2    pipeline infrastructure for the planned transport of captured CO   2    for use in enhanced oil recovery.

Kemper IGCC Schedule and Cost Estimate 
  In 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order, a detailed order confirming the CPCN originally approved by the Mississippi PSC in 2010 authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the Kemper IGCC. The certificated cost estimate of the Kemper IGCC included in the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order was $2.4 billion, net of $245 million of Initial DOE Grants and excluding the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO   2    pipeline facilities, and AFUDC related to the Kemper IGCC. The 2012 MPSC CPCN Order approved a construction cost cap of up to $2.88 billion, with recovery of prudently-incurred costs subject to approval by the Mississippi PSC. The Kemper IGCC was originally projected to be placed in service in May 2014. Mississippi Power placed the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper IGCC in service in August 2014 and continues to progress towards completing the remainder of the Kemper IGCC, including the gasifiers and the gas clean-up facilities. The initial production of syngas began on July 14, 2016 for gasifier "B" and on September 13, 2016 for gasifier "A." On October 11, 2016, the Kemper IGCC began testing using clean syngas from gasifier "A" and the related gas clean-up systems to produce electricity. Late on October 31, 2016, gasifier "A" experienced challenges associated with the ash removal systems, and on November 2, 2016, Mississippi Power determined a maintenance outage on gasifier "A" is needed to make improvements to the ash removal systems. Therefore, Mississippi Power has re-sequenced activities, and gasifier "B" is now expected to progress through testing and begin producing electricity during the gasifier "A" outage. In light of these changes, Mississippi Power has determined that integrated operation of both gasifiers will not occur by mid-November and has revised the expected in-service date for the remainder of the Kemper IGCC to December 31, 2016. The remaining schedule reflects the time expected to achieve production of electricity using gasifier "B," complete gasifier "A" outage activities, and resume electricity production using gasifier "A," as well as to complete the integration of all systems necessary for both combustion turbines to simultaneously generate electricity with syngas.

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Recovery of the costs subject to the cost cap and the Cost Cap Exceptions remains subject to review and approval by the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power's Kemper IGCC 2010 project estimate, current cost estimate (which includes the impacts of the Court's decision discussed herein under "  Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs       2013 MPSC Rate Order  "), and actual costs incurred as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

(a) 
    The 2010 Project Estimate is the certificated cost estimate adjusted to include the certificated estimate for the CO   2    pipeline facilities approved in 2011 by the Mississippi PSC, as well as the lignite mine and equipment, AFUDC, and general exceptions. 
              (b) 
    Amounts in the Current Cost Estimate include certain estimated post-in-service costs which are expected to be subject to the cost cap. 
              (c) 
    The 2012 MPSC CPCN Order approved a construction cost cap of up to $2.88 billion, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. The Current Cost Estimate and the Actual Costs include non-incremental operating and maintenance costs related to the combined cycle and associated common facilities placed in service in August 2014 that are subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap and exclude post-in-service costs for the lignite mine. See "  Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs       2013 MPSC Rate Order  " herein for additional information. The Current Cost Estimate and the Actual Costs reflect 100% of the costs of the Kemper IGCC. See note (e) for additional information. 
              (d) 
    Mississippi Power's 2010 Project Estimate included recovery of financing costs during construction rather than the accrual of AFUDC. This approach was not approved by the Mississippi PSC as described in "Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs   2013 MPSC Rate Order." The Current Cost Estimate also reflects the impact of a settlement agreement with the wholesale customers for cost-based rates under FERC's jurisdiction. See "  FERC Matters  " herein for additional information. 
              (e) 
    Non-capital Kemper IGCC-related costs incurred during construction were initially deferred as regulatory assets. Some of these costs are now included in rates and are being recognized through income; however, such costs continue to be included in the Current Cost Estimate and the Actual Costs at   September 30, 2016  . The wholesale portion of debt carrying costs, whether deferred or recognized through income, is not included in the Current Cost Estimate and the Actual Costs at   September 30, 2016  . See "  Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs       Regulatory Assets and Liabilities  " herein for additional information. 
     Of the total costs, including post-in-service costs for the lignite mine, incurred as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $3.70 billion   was included in property, plant, and equipment (which is net of the Initial DOE Grants, the Additional DOE Grants, and estimated probable losses of   $2.63 billion  ),   $6 million   in other property and investments,   $81 million   in fossil fuel stock,   $46 million   in materials and supplies,   $33 million   in other regulatory assets, current,   $177 million   in other regulatory assets, deferred,   $4 million   in other current assets, and   $9 million   in other deferred charges and assets in the balance sheet. 
  Mississippi Power does not intend to seek rate recovery for any costs related to the construction of the Kemper IGCC that exceed the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for revisions to the cost estimate of   $88 million   (  $54 million   after tax) in the   third quarter 2016   and a total of   $222 million   (  $137 million   after tax) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Since 2012, in the aggregate, Mississippi Power has incurred charges of   $2.63 billion   (  $1.63 billion   after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through   September 30, 2016  . The increase to the cost estimate in the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflects $53 million for the extension of the Kemper IGCC's projected in-service date from October 31, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and  
  
   125

increased efforts related to operational readiness and challenges in start-up and commissioning activities, including the cost of repairs and modifications to gasifier "B" and mechanical improvements to coal feed and ash management systems, as well as certain post-in-service costs expected to be subject to the cost cap. The year-to-date increase to the cost estimate also includes $78 million for the extension of the Kemper IGCC's projected in-service date from August 31, 2016 to October 31, 2016. In addition, during the start-up and commissioning process, Mississippi Power is identifying potential improvement projects that ultimately may be completed subsequent to placing the remainder of the Kemper IGCC in service. If completed, such improvement projects would be expected to enhance plant performance, safety, and/or operations. The related potential costs have yet to be fully evaluated, have not been included in the current cost estimate, and may be subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap. 
  Any extension of the in-service date beyond December 31, 2016 is currently estimated to result in additional base costs of approximately   $25 million   to   $35 million   per month, which includes maintaining necessary levels of start-up labor, materials, and fuel, as well as operational resources required to execute start-up and commissioning activities. However, additional costs may be required for remediation of any further equipment and/or design issues identified. Any extension of the in-service date with respect to the Kemper IGCC beyond December 31, 2016 would also increase costs for the Cost Cap Exceptions, which are not subject to the   $2.88 billion   cost cap established by the Mississippi PSC. These costs include AFUDC, which is currently estimated to total approximately   $15 million   per month, as well as carrying costs and operating expenses on Kemper IGCC assets placed in service and consulting and legal fees of approximately   $3 million   per month. For additional information, see "  2015 Rate Case  " herein. 
  Mississippi Power's analysis of the time needed to complete the start-up and commissioning activities for the Kemper IGCC will continue until the remaining Kemper IGCC assets are placed in service. The next steps for the facility include the testing and production of electricity using clean syngas from gasifier "B," as well as the generation of electricity using clean syngas from gasifier "A," which are scheduled to occur by the end of November. If integrated operation of both gasifiers does not occur by mid-December, the expected in-service date and related cost estimate for the Kemper IGCC likely would require further revision. Further cost increases and/or extensions of the expected in-service date may result from factors including, but not limited to, difficulties integrating the systems required for sustained operations, sustaining nitrogen supply, major equipment failure, unforeseen engineering or design problems including any repairs and/or modifications to systems, and/or operational performance (including additional costs to satisfy any operational parameters ultimately adopted by the Mississippi PSC). Any further changes in the estimated costs of the Kemper IGCC subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions, will be reflected in Mississippi Power's statements of income and these changes could be material. 
  Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs 
  See "  FERC Matters  " herein for additional information regarding Mississippi Power's MRA cost based tariff relating to recovery of a portion of the Kemper IGCC costs from Mississippi Power's wholesale customers. Rate recovery of the retail portion of the Kemper IGCC is subject to the jurisdiction of the Mississippi PSC. See Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Unrecognized Tax Benefits       Section 174 Research and Experimental Deduction  " herein for additional tax information related to the Kemper IGCC. 
  The ultimate outcome of the rate recovery matters discussed herein, including the resolution of legal challenges, determinations of prudency, and the specific manner of recovery of prudently-incurred costs, cannot be determined at this time, but could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
  2012 MPSC CPCN Order 
  The 2012 MPSC CPCN Order included provisions relating to both Mississippi Power's recovery of financing costs during the course of construction of the Kemper IGCC and Mississippi Power's recovery of costs following the date the Kemper IGCC is placed in service. With respect to recovery of costs following the in-service date of the Kemper IGCC, the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order provided for the establishment of operational cost and revenue parameters

based upon assumptions in Mississippi Power's petition for the CPCN. Mississippi Power expects the Mississippi PSC to apply operational parameters in connection with future proceedings related to the operation of the Kemper IGCC. To the extent the Mississippi PSC determines the Kemper IGCC does not meet the operational parameters ultimately adopted by the Mississippi PSC or Mississippi Power incurs additional costs to satisfy such parameters, there could be a material adverse impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. See "Prudence" herein for additional information. 
  2013 MPSC Rate Order 
  In January 2013, Mississippi Power entered into a settlement agreement with the Mississippi PSC that was intended to establish the process for resolving matters regarding cost recovery related to the Kemper IGCC (2013 Settlement Agreement). Under the 2013 Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power agreed to limit the portion of prudently-incurred Kemper IGCC costs to be included in retail rate base to the $2.4 billion certificated cost estimate, plus the Cost Cap Exceptions, but excluding AFUDC, and any other costs permitted or determined to be excluded from the $2.88 billion cost cap by the Mississippi PSC. In March 2013, the Mississippi PSC issued a rate order approving retail rate increases of 15% effective March 19, 2013 and 3% effective January 1, 2014, which collectively were designed to collect   $156 million   annually beginning in 2014 (2013 MPSC Rate Order) to be used to mitigate customer rate impacts after the Kemper IGCC is placed in service, based on a mirror CWIP methodology (Mirror CWIP rate). 
  Because the 2013 MPSC Rate Order did not provide for the inclusion of CWIP in rate base as permitted by the Baseload Act, Mississippi Power continues to record AFUDC on the Kemper IGCC. Through September 30, 2016, AFUDC recorded since the original May 2014 estimated in-service date for the Kemper IGCC has totaled $352 million. Mississippi Power has not recorded any AFUDC on Kemper IGCC costs in excess of the $2.88 billion cost cap, except for Cost Cap Exception amounts. 
  On February 12, 2015, the Court reversed the 2013 MPSC Rate Order based on, among other things, its findings that (1) the Mirror CWIP rate treatment was not provided for under the Baseload Act and (2) the Mississippi PSC should have determined the prudence of Kemper IGCC costs before approving rate recovery through the 2013 MPSC Rate Order. The Court also found the 2013 Settlement Agreement unenforceable due to a lack of public notice for the related proceedings. On July 7, 2015, the Mississippi PSC ordered that the Mirror CWIP rate be terminated effective July 20, 2015 and required the fourth quarter 2015 refund of the   $342 million   collected under the 2013 MPSC Rate Order, along with associated carrying costs of   $29 million  . The Court's decision did not impact the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order or the February 2013 legislation described below. 
  2015 Rate Case 
  On August 13, 2015, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's request for interim rates, which presented an alternative rate proposal (In-Service Asset Proposal) designed to recover Mississippi Power's costs associated with the Kemper IGCC assets that are commercially operational and currently providing service to customers (the transmission facilities, combined cycle, natural gas pipeline, and water pipeline) and other related costs. The interim rates were designed to collect approximately $159 million annually and became effective with the first billing cycle for September 2015, subject to refund and certain other conditions. 
  On December 3, 2015, the Mississippi PSC issued the In-Service Asset Rate Order adopting in full the 2015 Stipulation entered into between Mississippi Power and the MPUS regarding the In-Service Asset Proposal. The In-Service Asset Rate Order provided for retail rate recovery of an annual revenue requirement of approximately   $126 million  , based on Mississippi Power's actual average capital structure, with a maximum common equity percentage of   49.733%  , a   9.225%   return on common equity, and actual embedded interest costs. The In-Service Asset Rate Order also included a prudence finding of all costs in the stipulated revenue requirement calculation for the in-service assets. The stipulated revenue requirement excluded the costs of the Kemper IGCC related to the 15% undivided interest that was previously projected to be purchased by SMEPA. Mississippi Power continues to evaluate its alternatives with respect to its investment and related costs associated with the 15% undivided interest. 
  
   127 

     Table of Contents  
  MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

With implementation of the new rates on December 17, 2015, the interim rates were terminated and, in March 2016, Mississippi Power completed customer refunds of approximately $11 million for the difference between the interim rates collected and the permanent rates. 
  On July 27, 2016, the Court dismissed Greenleaf's motion for reconsideration of its previous decision to dismiss Greenleaf's appeal of the In-Service Asset Rate Order. 
  In addition to current estimated costs at   September 30, 2016   of   $6.82 billion  , Mississippi Power anticipates that it will incur additional expenses in excess of current rates associated with operating the Kemper IGCC after it is placed in service until the Kemper IGCC cost recovery approach is finalized, which are expected to be material. These costs include, but are not limited to, regulatory costs, operational costs in excess of current rates, taxes, and additional carrying costs. Mississippi Power expects to request authority from the Mississippi PSC and the FERC to defer all Kemper IGCC costs incurred after the in-service date that cannot be capitalized, are not included in current rates, and are not required to be charged against earnings as a result of the $2.88 billion cost cap until such time as the Mississippi PSC completes its review and includes the resulting allowable costs in rates. Mississippi Power is required to file its next rate request with the Mississippi PSC related to cost recovery for the Kemper IGCC by June 3, 2017. See "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" below for additional information. As part of that filing, Mississippi Power expects to request recovery of certain costs that the Mississippi PSC had excluded from the revenue requirement calculation for the in-service assets. 
  Legislation to authorize a multi-year rate plan and legislation to provide for alternate financing through securitization of up to   $1.0 billion   of prudently-incurred costs was enacted into law in 2013. Mississippi Power expects to securitize prudently-incurred qualifying facility costs in excess of the certificated cost estimate of   $2.4 billion  . Qualifying facility costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs, construction costs, regulatory costs, and accrued AFUDC. The Court's decision regarding the 2013 MPSC Rate Order did not impact Mississippi Power's ability to utilize alternate financing through securitization or the February 2013 legislation. 
  Prudence 
  On August 17, 2016, the Mississippi PSC issued an order establishing a discovery docket to manage all filings related to the prudence of the Kemper IGCC. On October 3, 2016, Mississippi Power made a required compliance filing, which included a review and explanation of differences between the Kemper IGCC project estimate set forth in the 2010 CPCN proceeding and the most recent Kemper IGCC project estimate, as well as comparisons of current cost estimates and current expected plant operational parameters to the estimates presented in the 2010 CPCN proceedings for the first five years following the start of commercial operations. Certain costs, including operations and maintenance, are materially higher than the amounts presented in the CPCN proceedings. Additionally, while the current estimated operational availability estimates reflect ultimate results similar to those presented in the 2010 CPCN proceedings, the ramp up period for the current estimates reflects a lower starting point and a slower escalation rate. Mississippi Power expects the Mississippi PSC to address these issues in connection with its next rate request. 
  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 
  Consistent with the treatment of non-capital costs incurred during the pre-construction period, the Mississippi PSC issued an accounting order in 2011 granting Mississippi Power the authority to defer all non-capital Kemper IGCC-related costs to a regulatory asset through the in-service date, subject to review of such costs by the Mississippi PSC. Such costs include, but are not limited to, carrying costs on Kemper IGCC assets currently placed in service, costs associated with Mississippi PSC and MPUS consultants, prudence costs, legal fees, and operating expenses associated with assets placed in service. 
  In August 2014, Mississippi Power requested confirmation by the Mississippi PSC of Mississippi Power's authority to defer all operating expenses associated with the operation of the combined cycle subject to review of such costs by the Mississippi PSC. In addition, Mississippi Power is authorized to accrue carrying costs on the unamortized balance of such regulatory assets at a rate and in a manner to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future cost

recovery mechanism proceedings. Beginning in the third quarter 2015 and the second quarter 2016, in connection with the implementation of retail and wholesale rates, respectively, Mississippi Power began expensing certain ongoing project costs and certain retail debt carrying costs (associated with assets placed in service and other non-CWIP accounts) that previously were deferred as regulatory assets and began amortizing certain regulatory assets associated with assets placed in service and consulting and legal fees. The amortization periods for these regulatory assets vary from   two years   to   10 years   as set forth in the In-Service Asset Rate Order and the settlement agreement with wholesale customers. As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance associated with these regulatory assets was $105 million, of which $33 million is included in current assets. Other regulatory assets associated with the remainder of the Kemper IGCC totaled $105 million as of   September 30, 2016  . The amortization period for these assets is expected to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future rate proceedings following completion of construction and start-up of the Kemper IGCC and related prudence reviews. See "FERC Matters" herein for information related to the 2016 settlement agreement with wholesale customers. 
  The In-Service Asset Rate Order requires Mississippi Power to submit an annual true-up calculation of its actual cost of capital, compared to the stipulated total cost of capital, with the first occurring as of May 31, 2016. At   September 30, 2016  , Mississippi Power's related regulatory liability included in its balance sheet totaled approximately   $7 million  . See "  2015 Rate Case  " herein for additional information. 
  See Note 1 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Lignite Mine and CO   2    Pipeline Facilities 
  In conjunction with the Kemper IGCC, Mississippi Power will own the lignite mine and equipment and has acquired and will continue to acquire mineral reserves located around the Kemper IGCC site. The mine started commercial operation in June 2013. 
  In 2010, Mississippi Power executed a 40-year management fee contract with Liberty Fuels Company, LLC (Liberty Fuels), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, which developed, constructed, and is operating and managing the mining operations. The contract with Liberty Fuels is effective through the end of the mine reclamation. As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. In addition to the obligation to fund the reclamation activities, Mississippi Power currently provides working capital support to Liberty Fuels through cash advances for capital purchases, payroll, and other operating expenses. See Note 1 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal" and "Variable Interest Entities" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  In addition, Mississippi Power has constructed and will operate the CO   2    pipeline for the planned transport of captured CO   2    for use in enhanced oil recovery. Mississippi Power entered into agreements with Denbury Onshore (Denbury) and Treetop Midstream Services, LLC (Treetop), pursuant to which Denbury would purchase 70% of the CO   2    captured from the Kemper IGCC and Treetop would purchase 30% of the CO   2    captured from the Kemper IGCC. On June 3, 2016, Mississippi Power cancelled its contract with Treetop and amended its contract with Denbury to reflect, among other things, Denbury's agreement to purchase 100% of the CO   2    captured from the Kemper IGCC, an initial contract term of 16 years, and termination rights if Mississippi Power has not satisfied its contractual obligation to deliver captured CO   2    by July 1, 2017, in addition to Denbury's existing termination rights in the event of a change in law, force majeure, or an event of default by Mississippi Power. Any termination or material modification of the agreement with Denbury could impact the operations of the Kemper IGCC and result in a material reduction in Mississippi Power's revenues to the extent Mississippi Power is not able to enter into other similar contractual arrangements or otherwise sequester the CO   2    produced. Additionally, sustained oil price reductions could result in significantly lower revenues than Mississippi Power forecasted to be available to offset customer rate impacts, which could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. 
  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Litigation 
  On April 26, 2016, a complaint against Mississippi Power was filed in Harrison County Circuit Court (Circuit Court) by Biloxi Freezing   Processing Inc., Gulfside Casino Partnership, and John Carlton Dean, which was amended and refiled on July 11, 2016 to include, among other things, Southern Company as a defendant. On August 12, 2016, Southern Company and Mississippi Power removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, where the case is currently pending. However, the plaintiffs have filed a request to remand the case back to state court. The individual plaintiff, John Carlton Dean, alleges that Mississippi Power and Southern Company violated the Mississippi Unfair Trade Practices Act. All plaintiffs have alleged that Mississippi Power and Southern Company concealed, falsely represented, and failed to fully disclose important facts concerning the cost and schedule of the Kemper IGCC and that these alleged breaches have unjustly enriched Mississippi Power and Southern Company. The plaintiffs seek unspecified actual damages and punitive damages; ask the Circuit Court to appoint a receiver to oversee, operate, manage, and otherwise control all affairs relating to the Kemper IGCC; ask the Circuit Court to revoke any licenses or certificates authorizing Mississippi Power or Southern Company to engage in any business related to the Kemper IGCC in Mississippi; and seek attorney's fees, costs, and interest. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prevent any Kemper IGCC costs from being charged to customers through electric rates. 
  On June 9, 2016, Treetop, Greenleaf, Tenrgys, LLC, Tellus Energy, LLC, WCOA, LLC, and Tellus Operating Group filed a complaint against Mississippi Power, Southern Company, and SCS in the state court in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The complaint relates to the cancelled CO   2    contract with Treetop and alleges fraudulent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, civil conspiracy, and breach of contract on the part of Mississippi Power, Southern Company, and SCS and seeks compensatory damages of $100 million, as well as unspecified punitive damages. Southern Company, Mississippi Power, and SCS have moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the terms of the CO   2    contract. 
  Mississippi Power believes these legal challenges have no merit; however, an adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Mississippi Power will vigorously defend itself in these matters, and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Income Tax Matters 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Income Tax Matters" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K and Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Section 174 Research and Experimental Deduction  " herein for additional information. 
  Bonus Depreciation 
  The extension of 50% bonus depreciation included in the PATH Act is expected to result in approximately $400 million of positive cash flows for the 2016 tax year, which may not all be realized in 2016 due to a projected consolidated net operating loss for Southern Company. Approximately $370 million of the benefit is dependent upon placing the remainder of the Kemper IGCC in service by December 31, 2016, of which $250 million has been received as of September 30, 2016 through quarterly income tax refunds. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " and Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Current and Deferred Income Taxes       Net Operating Loss  " herein for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Other Matters 
  Mississippi Power is   involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition,   Mississippi Power is   subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.   Mississippi Power's   business activities   are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as regulation of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law

nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, such as air quality and water standards, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO   2    and other emissions  , CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. 
  The     ultimate     outcome     of     such     pending     or     potential     litigation     against     Mississippi Power     cannot     be     predicted     at     this     time;     however,     for     current     proceedings     not     specifically     reported     in     Note     (B)     to     the     Condensed     Financial     Statements     herein     or     in     Note     3     to     the     financial     statements     of     Mississippi Power     in     Item     8     of     the Form 10-K,     management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on   Mississippi Power's   financial statements. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential. 
  The SEC is conducting a formal investigation of Southern Company and Mississippi Power concerning the estimated costs and expected in-service date of the Kemper IGCC. Southern Company and Mississippi Power believe the investigation is focused primarily on periods subsequent to 2010 and on accounting matters, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting associated with the Kemper IGCC. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES   "  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  " herein for additional information on the Kemper IGCC estimated construction costs and expected in-service date. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of Mississippi Power. 
  ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Mississippi Power prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   ACCOUNTING POLICIES   "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a complete discussion of Mississippi Power's critical accounting policies and estimates related to Electric Utility Regulation, Asset Retirement Obligations, Contingent Obligations, Unbilled Revenues, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, and AFUDC. 
  Kemper IGCC Estimated Construction Costs, Project Completion Date, and Rate Recovery 
  During 2016, Mississippi Power further revised its cost estimate to complete construction and start-up of the Kemper IGCC to an amount that exceeds the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. Mississippi Power does not intend to seek any rate recovery for any costs related to the construction of the Kemper IGCC that exceed the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. 
  As a result of the revisions to the cost estimate, Mississippi Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable losses on the Kemper IGCC of   $88 million   (  $54 million   after tax) in the third quarter 2016, $81 million ($50 million after tax) in the second quarter 2016, $53 million ($33 million after tax) in the first quarter 2016, $183 million ($113 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2015,   $150 million   (  $93 million   after tax) in the third quarter 2015, $23 million ($14 million after tax) in the second quarter 2015, $9 million ($6 million after tax) in the first quarter 2015, $70 million ($43 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2014, $418 million ($258 million after tax) in the third quarter 2014,   $380 million   (  $235 million   after tax) in the first quarter 2014, $40 million ($25 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2013, $150 million ($93 million after tax) in the third quarter 2013, $450 million ($278 million after tax) in the second quarter 2013, $462 million ($285 million after tax) in the first quarter 2013, and $78 million ($48 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2012. In the aggregate, Mississippi Power has  
  
   131 

     Table of Contents  
  MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

incurred charges of   $2.63 billion   (  $1.63 billion   after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through   September 30, 2016  . 
  Mississippi Power's revised cost estimate reflects an expected in-service date of December 31, 2016 and includes certain post-in-service costs which are expected to be subject to the cost cap. Mississippi Power has experienced, and may continue to experience, material changes in the cost estimate for the Kemper IGCC. Further cost increases and/or extensions of the expected in-service date may result from factors including, but not limited to, difficulties integrating the systems required for sustained operations, sustaining nitrogen supply, major equipment failure, unforeseen engineering or design problems including any repairs and/or modifications to systems, and/or operational performance (including additional costs to satisfy any operational parameters ultimately adopted by the Mississippi PSC). In addition, during the start-up and commissioning process, Mississippi Power is also identifying potential improvement projects that ultimately may be completed subsequent to placing the remainder of the Kemper IGCC in service. If completed, such improvement projects would be expected to enhance plant performance, safety, and/or operations. The related potential costs have yet to be fully evaluated, have not been included in the current cost estimates, and may be subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap. In subsequent periods, any further changes in the estimated costs of the Kemper IGCC subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions, will be reflected in Mississippi Power's statements of income and these changes could be material. 
  Any extension of the in-service date beyond December 31, 2016 is currently estimated to result in additional base costs of approximately   $25 million   to   $35 million   per month, which includes maintaining necessary levels of start-up labor, materials, and fuel, as well as operational resources required to execute start-up and commissioning activities. However, additional costs may be required for remediation of any further equipment and/or design issues identified. Any extension of the in-service date with respect to the Kemper IGCC beyond December 31, 2016 would also increase costs for the Cost Cap Exceptions, which are not subject to the $2.88 billion cost cap established by the Mississippi PSC. These costs include AFUDC, which is currently estimated to total approximately   $15 million   per month, as well as carrying costs and operating expenses on Kemper IGCC assets placed in service and consulting and legal fees of approximately   $3 million   per month. 
  Given the significant judgment involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up, the project completion date, the ultimate rate recovery for the Kemper IGCC, and the potential impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations, Mississippi Power considers these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases     (Topic 842)   (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged  .   ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.   Mississippi Power is   currently evaluating the new standard and has not yet determined its ultimate impact; however, adoption of ASU 2016-02 is expected to have a significant impact on   Mississippi Power's   balance sheet. 
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation     (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 changes the accounting for income taxes and the cash flow presentation for share-based payment award transactions. Most significantly, entities are required to recognize all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock compensation as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.   Mississippi Power   currently recognizes any excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise and vesting of stock compensation as additional paid-in capital. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
  Overview 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Overview" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K and FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for additional information. Earnings for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were negatively affected by revisions to the cost estimate for the Kemper IGCC. 
  Through   September 30, 2016  , Mississippi Power has incurred non-recoverable cash expenditures of $2.42 billion and is expected to incur approximately $0.21 billion in additional non-recoverable cash expenditures through completion of the construction and start-up of the Kemper IGCC, which includes certain post-in-service costs expected to be subject to the cost cap. 
  Mississippi Power's capital expenditures and debt maturities are expected to materially exceed operating cash flows through 2021. In addition to the Kemper IGCC, projected capital expenditures in that period include investments to maintain existing generation facilities, to add environmental modifications to existing generating units, to add or change fuel sources for certain existing units, and to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities. 
  On January 28, 2016, Mississippi Power issued a promissory note for up to $275 million to Southern Company, which matures in December 2017, bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR. During the first nine months of   2016  , Mississippi Power borrowed $100 million under this promissory note and an additional $100 million under a separate promissory note issued to Southern Company in November 2015. On March 8, 2016, Mississippi Power entered into an unsecured term loan agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions for an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion. Mississippi Power borrowed $900 million on March 8, 2016 under the term loan agreement and the remaining $300 million on October 7, 2016. Mississippi Power used the initial proceeds to repay $900 million in maturing bank loans on March 8, 2016 and the remaining $300 million to repay at maturity Mississippi Power's Series 2011A 2.35% Senior Notes due October 15, 2016. On June 27, 2016, Mississippi Power received a capital contribution from Southern Company for $225 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay to Southern Company a portion of the existing promissory note issued in November 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of outstanding promissory notes to Southern Company totaled $551 million. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Mississippi Power's current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately $411 million primarily due to the $300 million in senior notes which matured on October 15, 2016, as well as $65 million in short-term debt. 
  Mississippi Power intends to utilize operating cash flows and lines of credit (to the extent available) as well as loans and, under certain circumstances, equity contributions from Southern Company to fund the remainder of its short-term capital needs. See "  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations  ," "  Sources of Capital  ," and "  Financing Activities  " herein for additional information. 
  Net cash provided from operating activities totaled   $372 million   for the first   nine months of 2016  , an increase of $23 million as compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase in cash provided from operating activities is primarily due to income taxes receivable associated with research and experimental (R E) deductions and accrued taxes, partially offset by lower R E tax deductions, the cessation of Mirror CWIP collections and subsequent refund payments, and higher recovery of regulatory fuel clause revenues. See Notes (B) and (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle       Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs  " and "  Unrecognized Tax Benefits       Section 174 Research and Experimental Deduction  " herein for additional information. Net cash used for investing activities totaled   $509 million   for the first   nine months of 2016   primarily due to gross property additions related to the Kemper IGCC, partially offset by receipt of $137 million in Additional DOE Grants. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled   $198 million   for the first   nine months  
  
   133

  MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

of 2016   primarily due to long-term debt issuances and capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by redemptions of long-term debt and a decrease in short-term borrowings. Cash flows from financing activities vary from period to period based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities. 
  Significant balance sheet changes for the first   nine months of 2016   include an increase in long-term debt of $826 million. A portion of this debt was used to repay securities and notes payable resulting in a $385 million decrease in securities due within one year and a $475 million decrease in notes payable. Additionally, CWIP increased $271 million primarily due to the Kemper IGCC and the customer liability associated with Kemper IGCC refunds decreased $72 million. Other significant changes include a $110 million increase in accrued income taxes due to bonus depreciation, a $61 million increase in accumulated deferred income taxes (ADIT) due to transmission and distribution property-related ADITs and additional Section 174 R E deduction, partially offset by ADITs associated with the estimated losses on the Kemper IGCC construction, and a $39 million increase in prepaid income taxes. Total common stockholder's equity increased $269 million primarily due to the receipt of capital contributions from Southern Company and net income for the period. 
  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a description of Mississippi Power's capital requirements for its construction program, including estimated capital expenditures for new generating resources and to comply with existing environmental statutes and regulations, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as related interest, leases, purchase commitments, derivative obligations, preferred stock dividends, trust funding requirements, and unrecognized tax benefits. Approximately $300 million will be required through   September 30, 2017   to fund maturities of long-term debt, and $25 million will be required to fund maturities of short-term debt. See "  Sources of Capital  " herein for additional information. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, Mississippi Power repaid at maturity $300 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2011A 2.35% Senior Notes due October 15, 2016. If the Kemper IGCC does not go into service by December 31, 2016, Mississippi Power also would have to repay approximately $250 million of tax benefits received as a result of quarterly income tax estimates through September 30, 2016. See "Income Tax Matters" herein for additional information. 
  The construction program of Mississippi Power is currently estimated to be $0.8 billion for   2016  , net of the Additional DOE Grants, $0.3 billion for 2017, $0.2 billion for 2018, $0.2 billion for 2019, $0.3 billion for 2020, and $0.3 billion for 2021, which includes revised estimates for the Kemper IGCC, including post-in-service costs. The expenditures related to the construction and start-up of the Kemper IGCC are currently estimated to be $0.7 billion for   2016  , net of the Additional DOE Grants, and $0.1 billion for 2017. These estimated expenditures do not include potential compliance costs that may arise from the EPA's final rules and guidelines or subsequently approved state plans that would limit CO   2    emissions from existing, new, modified, or reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. 
  The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; storm impacts; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Mississippi PSC approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. See Note (B) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle       Kemper IGCC Schedule and Cost Estimate  " herein for additional information and further risks related to the estimated schedule and costs and rate recovery for the Kemper IGCC.

Sources of Capital 
  In December 2015, the Mississippi PSC approved the In-Service Asset Rate Order, which among other things, provided for retail rate recovery of an annual revenue requirement of approximately $126 million effective December 17, 2015. The amount, type, and timing of future financings will depend upon regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions, and other factors, which includes resolution of Kemper IGCC cost recovery. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" and   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle   Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs   2013 MPSC Rate Order" and "   2015 Rate Case" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. Also see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Income Tax Matters   Bonus Depreciation" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Mississippi Power received $245 million of Initial DOE Grants in prior years that were used for the construction of the Kemper IGCC. An additional $25 million of grants from the DOE is expected to be received for commercial operation of the Kemper IGCC. On April 8, 2016, Mississippi Power received approximately $137 million in Additional DOE Grants for the Kemper IGCC, which are expected to be used to reduce future rate impacts for customers. In addition, see Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding legislation related to the securitization of certain costs of the Kemper IGCC. 
  On January 28, 2016, Mississippi Power issued a promissory note for up to $275 million to Southern Company, which matures in December 2017, bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR. During the first nine months of 2016, Mississippi Power borrowed $100 million pursuant to the $275 million promissory note and an additional $100 million under a separate promissory note issued to Southern Company in November 2015. On March 8, 2016, Mississippi Power entered into an unsecured term loan agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions for an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion. Mississippi Power borrowed $900 million on March 8, 2016 under the term loan agreement and the remaining $300 million on October 7, 2016. Mississippi Power used the initial proceeds to repay $900 million in maturing bank loans on March 8, 2016 and the remaining $300 million to repay at maturity Mississippi Power's Series 2011A 2.35% Senior Notes due October 15, 2016. The term loan pursuant to this agreement matures on April 1, 2018 and bears interest based on one-month LIBOR. On June 27, 2016, Mississippi Power received a capital contribution from Southern Company for $225 million, the proceeds of which were used to repay to Southern Company a portion of the existing promissory note issued in November 2015. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of outstanding promissory notes to Southern Company totaled $551 million. 
  Mississippi Power intends to utilize operating cash flows and lines of credit (to the extent available) as well as loans and, under certain circumstances, equity contributions from Southern Company to fund Mississippi Power's short-term capital needs. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Mississippi Power had approximately   $159 million   of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

See Note 6 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Bank Credit Arrangements" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Bank Credit Arrangements  " herein for additional information. 
  Most of these bank credit arrangements, as well as Mississippi Power's term loan arrangements, contain covenants that limit debt levels and typically contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions to other indebtedness

(including guarantee obligations) of Mississippi Power. Such cross default provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Mississippi Power defaulted on indebtedness or guarantee obligations over a specific threshold. Such cross acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Mississippi Power defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. Mississippi Power is in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowing. 
  Subject to applicable market conditions, Mississippi Power expects to seek to renew or replace its credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Mississippi Power may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. 
  A portion of the   $150 million   unused credit arrangements with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to Mississippi Power's pollution control revenue bonds and commercial paper borrowings. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $40 million  .

     Credit Rating Risk 
  Mississippi Power does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. 
  There are certain contracts that have required or could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, and transmission. At   September 30, 2016  , the maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at a rating of BBB and/or Baa2 or BBB- and/or Baa3 was not material. The maximum potential collateral requirements at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 equaled approximately $259 million. 
  Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company system power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Mississippi Power to access capital markets, and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so. 
  On May 12, 2016, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Mississippi Power to BBB+ from A- and revised the ratings outlook from negative to stable. 
  Financing Activities 
  On January 28, 2016, Mississippi Power issued a promissory note for up to $275 million to Southern Company, which matures in December 2017, bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR.

THIRD QUARTER 2016 vs. THIRD QUARTER 2015 
  AND 
  YEAR-TO-DATE 2016 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2015 

OVERVIEW 
  Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions and sales of assets, construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, independent power producers, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities. In general, Southern Power has constructed or acquired new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Southern Power acquired or commenced construction of approximately 758 MWs of additional solar and wind facilities and, subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , acquired or commenced construction of approximately 977 MWs of wind and natural gas facilities. In addition, Southern Power has committed to acquire approximately 674 MWs of solar and wind facilities over the next several months. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "  Acquisitions  " and "  Construction Projects  " herein for additional information. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Southern Power had an average investment coverage ratio of   92%   through 2020 and   91%   through 2025, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately   17   years. These ratios include the PPAs and capacity associated with facilities currently under construction and acquisitions discussed herein. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "  Power Sales Agreements  " herein for additional information. 
  Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include peak season equivalent forced outage rate, contract availability, and net income. For additional information on these indicators, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       OVERVIEW       "Key Performance Indicators" of Southern Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net Income 

Net income attributable to Southern Power for the   third quarter 2016   was   $176 million   compared to   $102 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . Net income attributable to Southern Power for   year-to-date 2016   was   $315 million   compared to   $181 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to increased federal income tax benefits from solar ITCs and wind PTCs and increased renewable energy sales, partially offset by increases in depreciation, operations and maintenance expenses, and interest expense from debt issuances, all related to new solar and wind facilities.

  SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Operating Revenues 

Operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas and biomass generating facilities, and PPA energy revenues which include sales from Southern Power's natural gas, biomass, solar, and wind facilities. To the extent Southern Power has unused capacity, it may sell power into the wholesale market or into the power pool. 
  Capacity revenues are an integral component of Southern Power's natural gas and biomass PPAs. Energy under these PPAs is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published gas indices. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. 
  Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, and other factors. 

In the   third quarter 2016  , operating revenues were   $500 million   compared to   $401 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The   $99 million   increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the following: 
             
    PPA capacity revenues decreased   $19 million   primarily due to the remarketing of generation capacity into the short-term markets as a result of PPA expirations. 
                
    PPA energy revenues     increased   $62 million   primarily due to an increase in renewable energy sales from new solar and wind facilities. 
                
    Revenues not covered by PPAs increased   $55 million   primarily due to an increase in short-term sales to non-affiliates as a result of the remarketing of generation capacity from expired PPAs. 
     For   year-to-date 2016  , operating revenues were   $1.2 billion   compared to   $1.1 billion   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The   $103 million   increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the following: 
             
    PPA capacity revenues decreased   $25 million   as a result of a $44 million decrease in non-affiliate capacity revenues primarily due to the remarketing of generation capacity into the short-term markets as a result of PPA expirations, partially offset by a $19 million increase in affiliate capacity revenues due to new PPAs.  
                
    PPA energy revenues     increased   $79 million   primarily due to a $122 million increase in renewable energy sales arising from new solar and wind facilities, partially offset by a decrease of $43 million in fuel revenues related to natural gas facility PPAs. 
     
   144 

     Table of Contents  
  SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Revenues not covered by PPAs increased   $46 million   due to a $70 million increase in short-term sales to non-affiliates as a result of the remarketing of generation capacity from expired PPAs, partially offset by a $24 million decrease in power pool revenue primarily associated with a reduction in available uncovered capacity.  
     Wholesale revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Increases and decreases in revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. 
  Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 
  Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for Southern Power. In addition, Southern Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market and the power pool. Details of Southern Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 

Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas and biomass generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the power pool, for capacity owned directly by Southern Power (excluding its subsidiaries). 
  Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. 

In the   third quarter 2016  , total fuel and purchased power expenses were   $187 million   compared to   $140 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to the following: 
             
    Fuel expense increased   $36 million   primarily due to a $27 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated and a $9 million increase associated with average cost of natural gas per KWH generated. 
     
   145 

     Table of Contents  
  SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Purchased power expense increased   $11 million   due to a $19 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs purchased, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in the average cost of purchased power and a $4 million decrease associated with a PPA expiration. 
     For   year-to-date 2016  , total fuel and purchased power expenses were   $417 million   compared to   $431 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The decrease was primarily due to the following: 
             
    Fuel expense decreased   $20 million   primarily due to a $42 million decrease associated with the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, partially offset by a $22 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated. 
                
    Purchased power expense increased   $6 million   due to a $48 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs purchased, largely offset by a $30 million decrease in the average cost of purchased power and a $12 million decrease associated with a PPA expiration. 
     Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses 

In the   third quarter 2016  , other operations and maintenance expenses were   $81 million   compared to   $62 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $9 million increase in expenses associated with new solar and wind facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016, a $5 million increase associated with scheduled outage and maintenance expenses, and a $3 million increase in general business expenses associated with Southern Power's overall growth strategy. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , other operations and maintenance expenses were   $246 million   compared to   $184 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to a $24 million increase associated with scheduled outage and maintenance expenses, a $22 million increase in expenses associated with new solar and wind facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016, and a $14 million increase in general business expenses associated with Southern Power's overall growth strategy. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 

In the   third quarter 2016  , depreciation and amortization was   $93 million   compared to   $64 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . For   year-to-date 2016  , depreciation and amortization was   $247 million   compared to   $183 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increases were primarily due to additional depreciation related to new solar and wind facilities placed in service in 2015 and 2016. 
  Interest Expense, net of Amounts Capitalized 

In the   third quarter 2016  , interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was   $35 million   compared to   $18 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase of $25 million in interest expense related to additional debt issued since the third quarter of 2015 primarily to fund Southern Power's growth strategy and continuous construction program, partially offset by an $8 million increase in capitalized interest associated

with the construction of solar facilities. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was   $78 million   compared to   $62 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase of $43 million in interest expense related to additional debt issued since the third quarter of 2015 primarily to fund Southern Power's growth strategy and continuous construction program, largely offset by a $27 million increase in capitalized interest associated with the construction of solar facilities. 
  Income Taxes (Benefit) 

N/M - Not meaningful 
  In the   third quarter 2016  , income tax benefit was   $(102) million   compared to an expense of   $1 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The change was primarily due to a $96 million increase in federal income tax benefits from solar ITCs and wind PTCs in 2016 and a $10 million decrease in tax expense related to lower pre-tax earnings in 2016, partially offset by a $3 million increase in tax expense related to beneficial state apportionment rate changes in 2015. 
  For   year-to-date 2016  , income tax benefit was   $(167) million   compared to an expense of   $14 million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The change was primarily due to a $171 million increase in federal income tax benefits from solar ITCs and wind PTCs in 2016 and a $17 million decrease in tax expense related to lower pre-tax earnings in 2016, partially offset by a $7 million increase in tax expense related to beneficial state apportionment rate changes in 2015. 
  See Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information. 
   
  FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL 
  The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of Southern Power's future earnings potential. The level of Southern Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Power's competitive wholesale business. These factors include: Southern Power's ability to achieve sales growth while containing costs; regulatory matters; creditworthiness of customers; total generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; the successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire; Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy, including successful additional investments in renewable and other energy projects, and to construct generating facilities; and the impact of federal ITCs and PTCs. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by economic growth. The pace of economic growth and electricity demand may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. 
  Other factors that could influence future earnings include weather, demand, cost of generation from units within the power pool, and operational limitations. For additional information relating to these factors, see RISK FACTORS in Item 1A and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL of Southern Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
  Power Sales Agreements 
  See BUSINESS   "The Southern Company System   Southern Power" in Item 1 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Southern Power's PPAs. Generally, under the solar and wind generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits. 
  At December 31, 2015, Southern Power's generation contract coverage ratio, which compares contracted capacity (MW) to available demonstrated capacity (MW), was an average of 75% through 2020 and 70% through 2025, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 10 years. 
  
   147 

     Table of Contents  
  SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Southern Power believes an investment coverage ratio best identifies the value of assets covered since it represents the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction or being acquired) as the investment amount. At   September 30, 2016  , the average investment coverage ratio was   92%   through 2020 and   91%   through 2025, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately   17   years. At December 31, 2015, the average investment coverage ratio would have been 91% through 2020 and 90% through 2025, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 18 years. 
  Environmental Matters 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Environmental Matters" of Southern Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for information on the development by federal and state environmental regulatory agencies of additional control strategies for emissions of air pollution from industrial sources, including electric generating facilities. Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate change, air quality, water quality, or other environmental and health concerns could also significantly affect Southern Power. While Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations, the full impact of any such legislative or regulatory changes cannot be determined at this time. 
  Environmental Statutes and Regulations 
  Air Quality 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Environmental Matters       Environmental Statutes and Regulations       Air Quality" of   Southern Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the EPA's Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). 
  On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates the CSAPR ozone season nitrogen oxide program, including revising ozone-season emissions budgets in   Alabama and Texas and removing Florida and North Carolina from the CSAPR program  . The ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of any legal challenges and implementation at the state level and cannot be determined at this time. 
  Acquisitions 
  During   2016  , in accordance with its overall growth strategy, Southern Power or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Southern Renewable Partnerships, LLC and Southern Renewable Energy, Inc., acquired or contracted to acquire the projects discussed below. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not material. See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Southern Power  " herein for additional information.

    100%   ownership interests in two wind facilities in Texas totaling   299   MWs, the majority of which is contracted under PPAs for the first   12   to   14   years of operation and are expected to close before the end of 2016; and 
                
    100%   ownership interest in a   275  -MW wind facility in Texas, the majority of which is contracted under a   12  -year PPA and is expected to close in January 2017. 
     The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  The aggregate amount of revenue recognized by Southern Power related to the project facilities acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included in the condensed consolidated statements of income for year-to-date 2016 is   $14 million  . The aggregate amount of net income, excluding impacts of ITCs and PTCs, attributable to Southern Power related to the project facilities acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included in the condensed consolidated statements of income is immaterial. These businesses did not have operating revenues or activities prior to completion of construction and their assets being placed in service; therefore, supplemental pro forma information as though the acquisitions occurred as of the beginning of 2016, and for the comparable 2015 period, is not meaningful and has been omitted. 
  Construction Projects 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS       FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Acquisitions" and "Construction Projects" of Southern Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations  " herein for additional information. 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , in accordance with its overall growth strategy, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service, or continued construction of, the projects set forth in the following table. Through   September 30, 2016  , total costs of construction incurred for the following projects were   $3.0 billion  , of which $  1.2 billion   remains in CWIP. Including the total construction costs incurred through   September 30, 2016   and the acquisition prices allocated to CWIP, total aggregate construction costs for the following projects are estimated to be   $3.1 billion   to   $3.2 billion  . The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

(a) 
    On March 29, 2016, Southern Power acquired an additional   15%   interest in Desert Stateline. As a result, Southern Power and the class B member are entitled to   66%   and   34%  , respectively, of all cash distributions from Desert Stateline. In addition, Southern Power will continue to be entitled to substantially all of the federal tax benefits with respect to the transaction.  
      Income Tax Matters 
  Bonus Depreciation 
  See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL   "Income Tax Matters   Bonus Depreciation" of Southern Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  The extension of 50% bonus depreciation included in the PATH Act is expected to result in approximately $650 million of positive cash flows for the 2016 tax year, which may not all be realized in 2016 due to a projected consolidated net operating loss (NOL) for Southern Company. As a result, the NOL will increase deferred tax assets for federal ITC and PTC carryforwards. See Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Current and Deferred Income Taxes       Net Operating Loss  " and "     Tax Credit Carryforwards  " herein for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Other Matters 
  Southern Power is   involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition,   Southern Power is   subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.   Southern Power's   business activities   are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as regulation of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, such as air quality and water standards, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO   2    and other emissions   and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. 
  The     ultimate     outcome     of     such     pending     or     potential     litigation     against     Southern Power     cannot     be     predicted     at     this     time;     however,     for     current     proceedings     not     specifically     reported     in     Note     (B)     to     the     Condensed     Financial     Statements     herein     or     in     Note     3     to     the     financial     statements     of     Southern Power     in     Item     8     of     the Form 10-K,     management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on   Southern Power's financial statements.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Southern Power prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Southern Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   ACCOUNTING POLICIES   "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" of Southern Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for a complete discussion of Southern Power's critical accounting policies and estimates related to Revenue Recognition, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles, Acquisition Accounting, Depreciation, and ITCs. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases     (Topic 842)   (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged  .   ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.   Southern Power is currently evaluating the new standard and has not yet determined its ultimate impact; however, adoption of ASU 2016-02 is expected to have a significant impact on Southern Power's balance sheet. 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
  Overview 
  Southern Power's financial condition remained stable at   September 30, 2016  . Southern Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as bank credit agreements as needed to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See "  Sources of Capital  " herein for additional information on lines of credit. 
  Net cash provided from operating activities totaled   $269 million   for the first   nine months of 2016   compared to   $609 million   for the first   nine months of 2015  . The decrease in net cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in unutilized ITCs and PTCs. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "Income Tax Matters   Bonus Depreciation" herein for additional information. Net cash used for investing activities totaled   $3.0 billion   for the first   nine months of 2016   primarily due to acquisitions and the construction of renewable facilities. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "  Acquisitions  " and "  Construction Projects  " herein for additional information. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled   $3.0 billion   for the first   nine months of 2016   primarily due to an increase in senior notes, notes payable, and capital contributions from Southern Company. Cash flows from financing activities vary from period to period based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities.  
  Significant balance sheet changes for the first   nine months of 2016   include a $515 million increase in CWIP due to the acquisition and continued construction of new solar and wind facilities and a $2.2 billion increase in plant in service, primarily due to solar and wind facilities being placed in service. Other significant changes include a $261 million increase in cash and cash equivalents and a $2.5 billion increase in notes payable and long-term debt primarily due to additional borrowings to fund acquisitions and construction projects. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL       "  Acquisitions  " and "  Construction Projects  " herein for additional information. 
  Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

description of Southern Power's capital requirements for its construction program, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as the related interest, leases, derivative obligations, unrecognized tax benefits, and other purchase commitments. Approximately $60 million will be required to repay maturities of long-term debt through   September 30, 2017  . In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and subsequent to that date, Southern Power entered into new long-term service agreements (LTSA), which begin between 2017 and 2020 and result in additional future commitments totaling approximately   $927 million  . 
  Southern Power's construction program includes estimates for potential plant acquisitions, new construction, capital improvements, and work to be performed under LTSAs, and is subject to periodic review and revision. Planned expenditures for plant acquisitions may vary materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy. Capital expenditures for Southern Power are currently estimated to total approximately   $4.5 billion   for 2016, primarily for acquisitions and/or construction of new generating facilities. Capital expenditures for Southern Power are currently estimated to total approximately $1.6 billion annually for 2017 through 2021. Actual capital costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors such as: changes in business conditions; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; changes in FERC rules and regulations; changes in load projections; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. See Note (I) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information. 
  Sources of Capital 
  Southern Power plans to obtain the funds required for acquisitions, construction, and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, short-term debt, securities issuances, term loans, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY   "Sources of Capital" of Southern Power in Item 7 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Southern Power's current liabilities sometimes exceed current assets due to the use of short-term debt as a funding source, and construction payables, as well as fluctuations in cash needs, due to both seasonality and the stage of acquisitions and construction projects. Southern Power expects to utilize the capital markets, bank term loans, and commercial paper markets as the source of funds for the majority of its debt maturities. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Southern Power had cash and cash equivalents of approximately   $1.1 billion  . 
  Details of short-term borrowings were as follows:

     Company Credit Facility 
  At   September 30, 2016  , Southern Power had a committed credit facility (Facility) of   $600 million   expiring in 2020, of which $68 million has been used for letters of credit and   $532 million   remains unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not borrowers under the Facility.

  SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES 
  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The Facility, as well as Southern Power's term loan agreement, contains a covenant that limits the ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined in the Facility) to a maximum of 65% and contains a cross default provision that is restricted only to indebtedness of Southern Power. For purposes of this definition, debt excludes any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power, and capitalization excludes the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiary. Southern Power is currently in compliance with all covenants in the Facility. 
  Proceeds from the Facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes as well as liquidity support for Southern Power's commercial paper program. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Power expects to renew or replace the Facility, as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Power may extend the maturity date and/or increase or decrease the lending commitment thereunder. See Note 6 to the financial statements of Southern Power under "Bank Credit Arrangements" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Bank Credit Arrangements  " herein for additional information. 
  Southern Power's commercial paper program is used to finance acquisition and construction costs related to electric generating facilities and for general corporate purposes, including maturing debt. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not borrowers under the commercial paper program. 
  Subsidiary Credit Facilities 
  In connection with the construction of solar facilities by     RE Garland Holdings LLC, RE Roserock LLC, and     RE Tranquillity LLC,   indirect subsidiaries of Southern Power, each subsidiary entered into separate credit agreements (Project Credit Facilities), which are non-recourse to Southern Power (other than the subsidiary party to the agr  eement). Ea  ch Project Credit Facility provides (a) a senior secured construction loan credit facility, (b) a senior secured bridge loan facility, and (c) a senior secured letter of credit facility that is secured by the membership interests of the respective project company, with proceeds directed to finance project costs related to the respective solar facilities. Each Project Credit Facility is secured by the assets of the applicable project subsidiary and membership interests of the applicable project subsidiary. The table below summarizes each Project Credit Facility as of     September 30, 2016  . 

The Project Credit Facilities above had total amounts outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   of $828 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.05%. For the   three  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , these credit agreements had a maximum amount outstanding of $828 million and an average amount outstanding of $805 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.02%. 
  Furthermore, in connection with the acquisition of the Henrietta solar facility on July 1, 2016, a subsidiary of Southern Power assumed a $217 million construction loan, which was fully repaid prior to   September 30, 2016  . For the   three  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , this credit agreement had a maximum amount outstanding of $217 million and an average amount outstanding of $137 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.21%. 
  Southern Power believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing the commercial paper program, the Facility, bank term loans, and operating cash flows.

Credit Rating Risk 
  Southern Power does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. 
  There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB and/or Baa2, or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, and foreign currency risk management. 
  The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Southern Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so. 
  In addition, Southern Power has a PPA that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPA requires credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. 
  Financing Activities 
  In June 2016, Southern Power issued  600 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2016A 1.00% Senior Notes due June 20, 2022 and  500 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2016B 1.85% Senior Notes due June 20, 2026. The proceeds are being allocated to renewable energy generation projects. Southern Power's obligations under its euro-denominated fixed-rate notes were effectively converted to fixed-rate U.S. dollars at issuance through cross-currency swaps, removing foreign currency exchange risk associated with the interest and principal payments. See Note (H) to the Condensed Financial Statements under "  Foreign Currency Derivatives  " herein for additional information. 
  In September 2016, Southern Power issued $290 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2016C 2.75% Senior Notes due September 20, 2023. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including Southern Power's growth strategy and continuous construction program, as well as repayment of amounts outstanding under the Project Credit Facilities. 
  Also in September 2016, Southern Power repaid $80 million of an outstanding $400 million floating rate bank loan and extended the maturity date of the remaining $320 million from September 2016 to September 2018. In addition, Southern Power entered into a $60 million aggregate principal amount floating rate bank loan bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR due September 2017. The proceeds were used to repay existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. 
  In addition, Southern Power issued $34 million in letters of credit during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Southern Power's subsidiaries incurred an additional $691 million of short-term borrowings pursuant to the Project Credit Facilities at a weighted average interest rate of 2.05%. Furthermore, in connection with the acquisition of the Henrietta solar facility, a subsidiary of Southern

Power assumed a $217 million construction loan, which was fully repaid prior to   September 30, 2016  . In addition, Southern Power's subsidiaries issued $16 million in letters of credit. 
  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , Southern Power's subsidiaries borrowed $5 million pursuant to the Project Credit Facilities at a weighted average interest rate of 2.03%. In addition, on October 14, 2016, Southern Power repaid at maturity $246 million of Project Credit Facility debt. 
  In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Southern Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

           (A) 
    INTRODUCTION 
     The condensed quarterly financial statements of each registrant included herein have been prepared by such registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Condensed Balance Sheets as of   December 31, 2015   have been derived from the audited financial statements of each registrant. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the information regarding such registrant furnished herein reflects all adjustments, which, except as otherwise disclosed, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the results of operations for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although each registrant believes that the disclosures regarding such registrant are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Disclosures which would substantially duplicate the disclosures in the Form 10-K and details which have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the filing of the Form 10-K are generally omitted from this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q unless specifically required by GAAP. Therefore, these Condensed Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K. Due to the seasonal variations in the demand for energy, operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. 
  Southern Company's financial statements reflect its investments in its subsidiaries, including Southern Company Gas as a result of the Merger, on a consolidated basis. Southern Company Gas' results of operations and cash flows since July 1, 2016 and financial condition as of September 30, 2016 are reflected within Southern Company's consolidated amounts in these accompanying notes herein. Southern Company Gas continues to maintain reporting requirements as an SEC registrant and has filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC separately from this combined Form 10-Q. The equity method is used for entities in which Southern Company has significant influence but does not control, including Southern Company Gas' investment in Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (SNG), and for variable interest entities where Southern Company has an equity investment but is not the primary beneficiary. See Note (I) under "  Southern Company         Merger with Southern Company Gas  " and "       Investment in Southern Natural Gas  " for additional information regarding the Merger and Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG, respectively. 
  Certain prior year data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of any registrant. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases     (Topic 842)   (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged     and there is no change to the accounting for existing leveraged leases.     ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption

permitted.   The registrants are currently evaluating the new standard and have not yet determined its ultimate impact; however, adoption of ASU 2016-02 is expected to have a significant impact on the registrants' balance sheets. 
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation     (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 changes the accounting for income taxes and the cash flow presentation for share-based payment award transactions. Most significantly, entities are required to recognize all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock compensation as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.   Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies currently recognize any excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to the exercise and vesting of stock compensation as additional paid-in capital. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies intend to adopt the ASU in the fourth quarter 2016. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies. 
  Affiliate Transactions 
  In 2014, prior to Southern Company's acquisition of PowerSecure International, Inc. (PowerSecure) on May 9, 2016, Georgia Power entered into   two   agreements with PowerSecure to build solar power generation facilities at   two   U.S. Army bases, as approved by the Georgia PSC. Payments of approximately   $108 million   made by Georgia Power to PowerSecure under the   two   agreements since inception in 2014 are included in CWIP at   September 30, 2016  . PowerSecure construction service costs of approximately   $0.2 million   are included in accounts payable, affiliated in Georgia Power's balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  . On October 4, 2016, the   two   facilities began commercial operation. 
  Prior to Southern Company Gas' completion of its acquisition of a   50%   equity interest in SNG, Southern Company and Southern Company Gas had entered into long-term interstate natural gas transportation agreements with SNG. The interstate transportation service provided to the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas by SNG pursuant to these agreements is governed by the terms and conditions of SNG's natural gas tariff and is subject to FERC regulation. For the period subsequent to Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG, transportation costs paid to SNG by Southern Company were approximately   $16 million  , including   $8 million   for Georgia Power,   $2 million   for Southern Power, and   $1 million   for Alabama Power. 
  See Note (I) under "  Southern Company         Acquisition of PowerSecure International, Inc.  " and "       Investment in Southern Natural Gas  " for additional information regarding Southern Company's acquisition of PowerSecure and Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG, respectively. 
  Asset Retirement Obligations 
  See Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power under "Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Southern Company's and the traditional electric operating companies' asset retirement obligations (ARO) and the EPA's regulation of CCR. See Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Power under "Asset Retirement Obligations" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Southern Power's AROs. 
  The cost estimates below are based on information as of   September 30, 2016  . The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities final rule requirements for closure in place or by other methods. As further analysis is performed, including evaluation of the expected method of compliance, refinement of assumptions underlying the cost estimates, such as the quantities of CCR at each site, and the determination of timing, including the potential for closing ash ponds prior to the end of their currently anticipated useful life, the traditional electric operating companies expect to continue to periodically update these estimates.

As of   September 30, 2016  , details of the AROs included in the registrants' Condensed Balance Sheets were as follows: 

The traditional electric operating companies' increases in cash flow revisions for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily relate to changes in ash pond closure strategy. The increase for Georgia Power reflects its decision in June 2016 to cease operating and stop receiving coal ash at all of its ash ponds within the next   three years   and to eventually close all of its ash ponds either by removal, consolidation, and/or recycling for the beneficial use of coal ash or through closure in place using advanced engineering methods. 
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  As of September 30, 2016, goodwill was as follows:

Amortization associated with other intangible assets was as follows: 

At December 31, 2015, other intangible assets consisted primarily of Southern Power's PPA fair value adjustments with a net carrying amount of   $317 million  . The increases in goodwill and other intangible assets primarily relate to Southern Company's acquisitions of PowerSecure on May 9, 2016 and Southern Company Gas on July 1, 2016. 
  See Note 12 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Southern Power" and Note 2 to the financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Southern Power's PPA fair value adjustments. Also see Note (I) under "  Southern Company         Acquisition of PowerSecure International, Inc.  " and "         Merger with Southern Company Gas  " for additional information. 
  Natural Gas for Sale 
  Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities, with the exception of Nicor Gas, carry natural gas inventory on a weighted average cost of gas (WACOG) basis.

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

Nicor Gas' natural gas inventory is carried at cost on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Inventory decrements occurring during the year that are restored prior to year-end are charged to cost of natural gas at the estimated annual replacement cost. Inventory decrements that are not restored prior to year-end are charged to cost of natural gas at the actual LIFO cost of the layers liquidated. The cost of natural gas, including inventory costs, is recovered from customers under a purchased gas recovery mechanism adjusted for differences between actual costs and amounts billed; therefore, LIFO liquidations have no impact on Southern Company's net income  . 
  Southern Company Gas' other natural gas inventories are carried at the lower of weighted average cost or current market price, with cost determined on a WACOG basis. For any declines in market prices below the WACOG considered to be other than temporary, an adjustment is recorded to reduce the value of natural gas inventories to market value  .

    CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS 
     See Note 3 to the financial statements of the registrants in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information relating to various lawsuits, other contingencies, and regulatory matters. 
  General Litigation Matters 
  Nicor Gas and Nicor Energy Services Company, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Southern Company Gas, and Nicor Inc. are defendants in a putative class action initially filed in September 2011 in state court in Cook County, Illinois. The plaintiffs purport to represent a class of the customers who purchased the Gas Line Comfort Guard product from Nicor Energy Services Company and variously allege that the marketing, sale, and billing of the Gas Line Comfort Guard product violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, constituting common law fraud and resulting in unjust enrichment of these entities. The plaintiffs seek, on behalf of the classes they purport to represent, actual and punitive damages, interest, costs, attorney fees, and injunctive relief. On October 26, 2016, the court held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for class certification and the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs' claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Each registrant is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, business activities of Southern Company's subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as regulation of air emissions and water discharges. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as air quality and water standards, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO   2    and other emissions, CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters. 
  The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each registrant and any subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Note 3 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on such registrant's financial statements. 
  Environmental Remediation 
  The Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois, New Jersey, Georgia, and Florida, have each received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies.

Georgia Power's environmental remediation liability as of   September 30, 2016   was   $23 million  . Georgia Power has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at sites governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), including a site in Brunswick, Georgia on the CERCLA National Priorities List. The PRPs at the Brunswick site have completed a removal action as ordered by the EPA. On July 29, 2016, Honeywell International, Inc. and Georgia Power entered into a consent decree with the EPA to perform additional remediation at the site. Additional response actions at the site are anticipated. In September 2015, Georgia Power entered into an allocation agreement with another PRP, under which that PRP will be responsible (as between Georgia Power and that PRP) for paying and performing certain investigation, assessment, remediation, and other incidental activities at the Brunswick site, including costs associated with implementation of the consent decree. Assessment and potential cleanup of other sites are anticipated. 
  The ultimate outcome of these matters will depend upon the success of defenses asserted, the ultimate number of PRPs participating in the cleanup, and numerous other factors and cannot be determined at this time; however, as a result of Georgia Power's regulatory treatment for environmental remediation expenses, these matters are not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's financial statements. 
  Gulf Power's environmental remediation liability includes estimated costs of environmental remediation projects of approximately   $46 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . These estimated costs primarily relate to site closure criteria by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for potential impacts to soil and groundwater from herbicide applications at Gulf Power substations. The schedule for completion of the remediation projects is subject to FDEP approval. The projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery through Gulf Power's environmental cost recovery clause; therefore, these liabilities have no impact on net income. 
  The final outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, based on the currently known conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites, management of Southern Company and Gulf Power does not believe that additional liabilities, if any, at these sites would be material to their respective financial statements  . 
  Southern Company Gas' environmental remediation liability as of     September 30, 2016   was   $433 million   based on the estimated cost of environmental investigation and remediation associated with known current and former operating sites. These environmental remediation expenditures are recoverable from customers through rate mechanisms approved by the applicable state regulatory agencies of Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities, with the exception of one site representing   $5 million   of the total accrued remediation costs. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time; however, these matters are not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements. 
  I  n September 2015, the EPA filed an administrative complaint and notice of opportunity for hearing against Nicor Gas. The complaint alleges violation of the regulatory requirements applicable to polychlorinated biphenyls in the Nicor Gas natural gas distribution system and the EPA seeks a total civil penalty of approximately   $0.3 million  . The ultimate resolution of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, the final disposition of this matter is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements. 
  FERC Matters 
  Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "FERC Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding a settlement agreement entered into by Mississippi Power regarding the establishment of a regulatory asset for Kemper IGCC-related costs. See "  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle  " herein for information regarding Mississippi Power's construction of the Kemper IGCC. 
  On March 31, 2016, Mississippi Power reached a settlement agreement with its wholesale customers and filed a request with the FERC for an increase in wholesale base revenues under the Municipal and Rural Associations (MRA) cost-based electric tariff, primarily as a result of placing scrubbers for Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 in service

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

in November 2015. The settlement agreement, accepted by the FERC, effective for services rendered beginning May 1, 2016, provides that base rates under the MRA cost-based electric tariff will produce additional annual base revenues of   $7 million  . Additionally, under the settlement agreement, the tariff customers agreed to similar regulatory treatment for MRA tariff ratemaking as the treatment approved for retail ratemaking under the December 2015 Mississippi PSC order authorizing rates providing recovery of assets previously placed in service (In-Service Asset Rate Order). This regulatory treatment primarily includes (i) recovery of the Kemper IGCC assets currently operational and providing service to customers and other related costs, (ii) amortization of the Kemper IGCC-related regulatory assets included in rates under the settlement agreement over   36   months, (iii) Kemper IGCC-related expenses included in rates under the settlement agreement no longer being deferred and charged to expense, and (iv) removing all of the Kemper IGCC CWIP from rate base with a corresponding increase in accrual of AFUDC. The additional resulting AFUDC is estimated to be approximately   $11 million   through the Kemper IGCC's projected in-service date of December 31, 2016. 
  Fuel Cost Recovery 
  Mississippi Power has a wholesale MRA and a Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factor. At   September 30, 2016  , the amount of over-recovered wholesale MRA fuel costs included in the balance sheets was   $17 million   compared to   $24 million   at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the amount of over-recovered wholesale MB fuel costs included in the balance sheets was   $1 million  . Effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016, fuel rates decreased   $11 million   annually for wholesale MRA customers and   $1 million   annually for wholesale MB customers. 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "FERC Matters       Fuel Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Market-Based Rate Authority 
  The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have authority from the FERC to sell electricity at market-based rates. Since 2008, that authority, for certain balancing authority areas, has been conditioned on compliance with the requirements of an energy auction, which the FERC found to be tailored mitigation that addresses potential market power concerns. In accordance with FERC regulations governing such authority, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power filed a triennial market power analysis in 2014, which included continued reliance on the energy auction as tailored mitigation. In April 2015, the FERC issued an order finding that the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power's existing tailored mitigation may not effectively mitigate the potential to exert market power in certain areas served by the traditional electric operating companies and in some adjacent areas. The FERC directed the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power to show why market-based rate authority should not be revoked in these areas or to provide a mitigation plan to further address market power concerns. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power filed a request for rehearing in May 2015 and in June 2015 filed their response with the FERC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Accounting Order 
  In April 2016, as part of its environmental compliance strategy, Alabama Power ceased using coal at Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (  300   MWs representing Alabama Power's ownership interest) and began operating Units 1 and 2 solely on natural gas in June 2016 and July 2016, respectively. 
  Georgia Power 
  Rate Plans 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Rate Plans" and "Retail Regulatory Matters   Rate Plans," respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Georgia Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through the 2013 ARP, which includes traditional base tariff rates, Demand-Side Management tariffs, Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery tariffs, and Municipal Franchise Fee tariffs. In addition, financing costs related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected through separate fuel cost recovery tariffs. See "  Nuclear Construction  " herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Nuclear Construction" and Southern Company under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the NCCR tariff. Also see "  Fuel Cost Recovery  " herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery" and Southern Company under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Fuel Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding fuel cost recovery. 
  Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement related to Southern Company's acquisition of Southern Company Gas approved by the Georgia PSC on April 14, 2016, Georgia Power's 2013 ARP will continue in effect until December 31, 2019, and Georgia Power will be required to file its next base rate case by July 1, 2019. Furthermore, through December 31, 2019, Georgia Power and Atlanta Gas Light Company (collectively, Utilities) each will retain their respective merger savings, net of transition costs, as defined in the settlement agreement;  
  
   165 

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

through December 31, 2022, such net merger savings applicable to each utility will be shared on a   60  /  40   basis between their respective customers and the Utilities; thereafter, all merger savings will be retained by customers. See Note (I) under "  Southern Company       Merger with Southern Company Gas  " for additional information regarding the Merger. 
  Integrated Resource Plan 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Integrated Resource Plan" and "Retail Regulatory Matters   Integrated Resource Plan," respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Georgia Power's triennial Integrated Resource Plan (2016 IRP). 
  On July 28, 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2016 IRP including the decertification and retirement of Plant Mitchell Units 3, 4A, and 4B (  217   MWs) and Plant Kraft Unit 1 combustion turbine (  17   MWs), as well as the decertification of the Intercession City unit (  143   MWs total capacity). On August 2, 2016, the Plant Mitchell and Plant Kraft units were retired. On August 31, 2016, Georgia Power sold its   33%   ownership interest in the Intercession City unit to Duke Energy Florida, Inc. 
  Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's environmental compliance strategy and related expenditures proposed in the 2016 IRP, including measures taken to comply with existing government-imposed environmental mandates, subject to limits on expenditures for Plant McIntosh Unit 1 and Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4. 
  The Georgia PSC approved the reclassification of the remaining net book value of Plant Mitchell Unit 3 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date to a regulatory asset. Recovery of the unit's net book value will continue through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP. The timing of the recovery of the remaining balance of the unit's net book value as of December 31, 2019 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date will be deferred for consideration in Georgia Power's base rate case required to be filed by July 1, 2019. 
  The Georgia PSC also approved the Renewable Energy Development Initiative to procure an additional   1,200   MWs of renewable resources primarily utilizing market-based prices established through a competitive bidding process with expected in-service dates between 2018 and 2021. Additionally,   200   MWs of self-build capacity for use by Georgia Power was approved, as well as consideration for no more than   200   MWs of capacity as part of a renewable commercial and industrial program. 
  The Georgia PSC also approved recovery of costs up to   $99 million   through June 30, 2019 to preserve the nuclear option at a future generation site in Stewart County, Georgia. The timing of cost recovery will be determined by the Georgia PSC in a future base rate case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Fuel Cost Recovery 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Fuel Cost Recovery" and "Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery," respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Georgia Power's over recovered fuel balance totaled   $125 million   and   $116 million  , respectively. For   September 30, 2016  , the balance is included in over recovered regulatory clause revenues, current on Georgia Power's Condensed Balance Sheets and in other current liabilities on Southern Company's Condensed Balance Sheets. For   December 31, 2015  , the balance is included in over recovered regulatory clause revenues, current and other deferred credits and liabilities on Georgia Power's Condensed Balance Sheets and in other current liabilities and other deferred credits and liabilities on Southern Company's Condensed Balance Sheets. On May 17, 2016, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to decrease fuel rates by   15%   effective June 1, 2016, which will reduce annual billings by approximately   $313 million  . Georgia Power is currently scheduled to file its next fuel case by February 28, 2017.

Fuel cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's revenues or net income, but will affect cash flow. 
  Storm Damage Recovery 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance in Georgia Power's regulatory asset related to storm damage was   $94 million  . During October 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities. The total amount of restoration costs related to this hurricane is estimated to be between   $130 million   and   $155 million  , which will be charged to capital accounts or to the storm damage reserve. Georgia Power is accruing   $30 million   annually through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP, to the storm damage reserve to cover the operating and maintenance costs of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities, which is recoverable through base rates. The rate of recovery of storm damage costs after December 31, 2019 is expected to be adjusted in Georgia Power's base rate case required to be filed by July 1, 2019. As a result of this regulatory treatment, costs related to storms are not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's financial statements. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Storm Damage Recovery" and Note 1 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Storm Damage Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Georgia Power's storm damage reserve. 
  Nuclear Construction 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Georgia Power   Nuclear Construction" and "Retail Regulatory Matters   Nuclear Construction," respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, Vogtle Construction Monitoring (VCM) reports, the NCCR tariff, the Vogtle Construction Litigation (as defined below), and the Contractor Settlement Agreement (as defined below). 
  In 2008, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Vogtle Owners, entered into an agreement with the Contractor, pursuant to which the Contractor agreed to design, engineer, procure, construct, and test Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement). 
  Under the terms of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, the Vogtle Owners agreed to pay a purchase price subject to certain price escalations and adjustments, including fixed escalation amounts and index-based adjustments, as well as adjustments for change orders, and performance bonuses for early completion and unit performance. The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement also provides for liquidated damages upon the Contractor's failure to fulfill the schedule and performance guarantees, subject to a cap. In addition, the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement provides for limited cost sharing by the Vogtle Owners for Contractor costs under certain conditions (which have not occurred), with maximum additional capital costs under this provision attributable to Georgia Power (based on Georgia Power's ownership interest) of approximately   $114 million  . Each Vogtle Owner is severally (and not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to the Contractor under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. Georgia Power's proportionate share is   45.7%  . 
  On December 31, 2015, Westinghouse acquired Stone   Webster, Inc. from Chicago Bridge   Iron Company, N.V. (CB I) and changed the name of Stone   Webster, Inc. to WECTEC Global Project Services Inc. (WECTEC). Certain obligations of Westinghouse and WECTEC under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement were originally guaranteed by Toshiba Corporation (Westinghouse's parent company) and The Shaw Group Inc. (which is now a subsidiary of CB I), respectively. On March 9, 2016, in connection with Westinghouse's acquisition of WECTEC and pursuant to the settlement agreement described below, the guarantee of The Shaw Group Inc. was terminated. The guarantee of Toshiba Corporation remains in place. In the event of certain credit rating downgrades of any Vogtle Owner, such Vogtle Owner will be required to provide a letter of credit or other credit enhancement. Additionally, as a result of credit rating downgrades of Toshiba Corporation, Westinghouse provided the Vogtle Owners with letters of credit in an aggregate amount of   $920 million   in accordance with, and subject to adjustment under, the terms of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement.

The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay certain termination costs. The Contractor may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement under certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspension or delays of work, action by a governmental authority to permanently stop work, certain breaches of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement by the Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events. 
  In 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 each year. If the projected construction capital costs to be borne by Georgia Power increase by   5%   above the certified cost or the projected in-service dates are significantly extended, Georgia Power is required to seek an amendment to the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate from the Georgia PSC. In February 2013, Georgia Power requested an amendment to the certificate to increase the estimated in-service capital cost of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from   $4.4 billion   to   $4.8 billion   and to extend the estimated in-service dates to the fourth quarter 2017 (from April 2016) and the fourth quarter 2018 (from April 2017) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively. In October 2013, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation (2013 Stipulation) between Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC Staff to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3 or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia Power. 
  On April 15, 2015, the Georgia PSC issued a procedural order in connection with the twelfth VCM report, which included a requested amendment (Requested Amendment) to the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate to reflect the Contractor's revised forecast for completion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (second quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020, respectively) and to increase the estimated total in-service capital cost of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to   $5.0 billion  . Pursuant to the Georgia PSC's procedural order, the Georgia PSC deemed the Requested Amendment unnecessary and withdrawn until the completion of construction of Plant Vogtle Unit 3 consistent with the 2013 Stipulation. The Georgia PSC recognized that the certified cost and the 2013 Stipulation do not constitute a cost recovery cap. In accordance with the Georgia Integrated Resource Planning Act, any costs incurred by Georgia Power in excess of the certified amount will be included in rate base, provided Georgia Power shows the costs to be reasonable and prudent. 
  On December 31, 2015, Westinghouse and the Vogtle Owners entered into a definitive settlement agreement (Contractor Settlement Agreement) to resolve disputes between the Vogtle Owners and the Contractor under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, including litigation that was pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia (Vogtle Construction Litigation). Effective December 31, 2015, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, and the Contractor entered into an amendment to the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement to implement the Contractor Settlement Agreement. The Contractor Settlement Agreement and the related amendment to the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement (i) restrict the Contractor's ability to seek further increases in the contract price by clarifying and limiting the circumstances that constitute nuclear regulatory changes in law; (ii) provide for enhanced dispute resolution procedures; (iii) revise the guaranteed substantial completion dates to match the current estimated in-service dates of June 30, 2019 for Unit 3 and June 30, 2020 for Unit 4; (iv) provide that delay liquidated damages will commence from the current estimated nuclear fuel loading date for each unit, which is December 31, 2018 for Unit 3 and December 31, 2019 for Unit 4; and (v) provide that Georgia Power, based on its ownership interest, will pay to the Contractor and capitalize to the project cost approximately   $350 million  , of which approximately   $256 million   had been paid as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, the Contractor Settlement Agreement provides for the resolution of other open existing items relating to the scope of the project under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, including cyber security, for which costs were reflected in Georgia Power's previously disclosed in-service cost estimate. Further, as part of the settlement and Westinghouse's acquisition of WECTEC: (i) Westinghouse engaged Fluor Enterprises, Inc., a subsidiary of Fluor Corporation, as a new construction subcontractor; and (ii) the Vogtle Owners, CB I, and The Shaw Group Inc. entered into mutual releases of any and all claims arising out of events or circumstances in connection with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 that occurred on or before the date of the Contractor Settlement Agreement. On January 5, 2016, the Vogtle Construction Litigation was dismissed with prejudice.

The Georgia PSC has approved fourteen VCM reports covering the periods through December 31, 2015, including construction capital costs incurred, which through that date totaled   $3.3 billion  . On January 21, 2016, Georgia Power submitted the Contractor Settlement Agreement and the related amendment to the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement to the Georgia PSC for its review. In accordance with the Georgia PSC's subsequent order, on April 5, 2016, Georgia Power filed supplemental information in support of the Contractor Settlement Agreement and Georgia Power's position that all construction costs to date have been prudently incurred and that the current estimated in-service capital cost and schedule are reasonable. 
  On October 20, 2016, Georgia Power and the Georgia PSC Staff entered into a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving the following prudence matters: (i) none of the   $3.3 billion   of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM report will be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement is reasonable and prudent and none of the amounts paid or to be paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) financing costs on verified and approved capital costs will be deemed prudent provided they are incurred prior to December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively; and (iv) (a) the in-service capital cost forecast will be adjusted to   $5.680 billion   (Revised Forecast), which includes a contingency of   $240 million   above Georgia Power's current forecast of   $5.440 billion  , (b) capital costs incurred up to the Revised Forecast will be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, and (c) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above the Revised Forecast are reasonable and prudent. Under the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, the certified in-service capital cost for purposes of calculating the NCCR tariff will remain at   $4.418 billion  . Construction capital costs above   $4.418 billion   will accrue AFUDC through commercial operation. The ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be reduced from   10.95%   (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013 ARP) to   10.00%   effective January 1, 2016. For purposes of the AFUDC calculation, the ROE on costs between   $4.418 billion   and   $5.440 billion   will also be   10.00%   and the ROE on any amounts above   $5.440 billion   would be Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt. If the Georgia PSC adjusts Georgia Power's ROE rate setting point in a rate case prior to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 being placed into retail rate base, then the ROE for purposes of calculating both the NCCR tariff and AFUDC will likewise be 95 basis points lower than the revised ROE rate setting point. If Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by December 31, 2020, then (i) the ROE for purposes of calculating the NCCR tariff will be reduced an additional 300 basis points, and may, at the Georgia PSC's discretion, be accrued to be used for the benefit of customers, until such time as the units reach commercial operation and (ii) the ROE used to calculate AFUDC will be Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt. 
  Under the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will be placed into retail rate base on December 31, 2020 or upon reaching commercial operation, whichever is later. The Georgia PSC will determine for retail ratemaking purposes the process of transitioning Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from a construction project to an operating plant   no   later than Georgia Power's base rate case required to be filed by July 1, 2019. 
  The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement is subject to approval by the Georgia PSC, which is scheduled to vote on this matter on December 20, 2016. Accordingly, the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement are subject to change and the terms of any final agreement approved by the Georgia PSC may differ materially from the terms of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. If approved, the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement is expected to reduce Georgia Power's revenues for the years 2016 through 2020 by a total of approximately   $325 million   (  $115 million   reduction in net income). 
  On August 31, 2016, Georgia Power filed the fifteenth VCM report with the Georgia PSC covering the period from January 1 through June 30, 2016 requesting approval of   $141 million   of construction capital costs incurred during that period. Georgia Power's CWIP balance for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 was   $3.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . Estimated financing costs during the construction period total approximately   $2.4 billion  , of which   $1.2 billion   had been incurred through   September 30, 2016  .

On November 1, 2016, Georgia Power submitted its 2017 NCCR tariff filing requesting that the current NCCR tariff rate remain effective for 2017 if the Georgia PSC approves the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. As required under the current order, Georgia Power concurrently submitted a 2017 NCCR tariff rate calculated using the current authorized   10.95%   ROE, which would result in an increase of approximately   $70 million  . 
  There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, at the federal and state level, and additional challenges may arise as construction proceeds. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of Inspections, Tests, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise as construction proceeds, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs either to the Vogtle Owners or the Contractor or to both. 
  As construction continues, the risk remains that challenges with Contractor performance including labor productivity, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and installation of plant systems, structures, and components, or other issues could arise and may further impact project schedule and cost. Contractor performance and progress in recent months, primarily associated with Unit 3, has resulted in additional current schedule pressure of approximately   three   to   four months   and has increased the likelihood of further schedule impacts to that unit. Georgia Power expects the Contractor to employ mitigation efforts to maintain the current project schedule and believes the Contractor is responsible for any related costs under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. Should Unit 3 be placed in service after June 2019, Georgia Power estimates its financing costs to be approximately   $22 million   per month. Additionally, Georgia Power estimates its owner's costs to be approximately   $2 million   per month, net of delay liquidated damages and certain incentive payments that would no longer be required to be paid per the Contractor Settlement Agreement. The Contractor's progress on Unit 4 indicates that the current estimated in-service date of June 2020 remains achievable. In addition, the IRS has allocated production tax credits to each of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which require the applicable unit to be placed in service before 2021. 
  Future claims by the Contractor or Georgia Power (on behalf of the Vogtle Owners) could arise throughout construction. These claims may be resolved through formal and informal dispute resolution procedures under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement and, under the enhanced dispute resolution procedures, may be resolved through litigation after the completion of nuclear fuel load for both units. 
  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Gulf Power 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Gulf Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers. 
  On May 5, 2016, Gulf Power delivered a letter to the Florida PSC requesting recognition of Gulf Power's ownership in Plant Scherer Unit 3 as being in service to retail customers when and as its existing wholesale contracts expire. As a result, on September 13, 2016, the Florida PSC instructed Gulf Power to file its monthly earnings surveillance reports both including and excluding its share of investment and expenses related to Plant Scherer Unit 3 that is not covered by contracts. See "  Retail Base Rate Cases  " and "  Cost Recovery Clauses  " herein for additional information.

In 2013, the Florida PSC approved a settlement agreement (2013 Rate Case Settlement Agreement) that authorized Gulf Power to reduce depreciation and record a regulatory asset up to   $62.5 million   from January 2014 through June 2017. In any given month, such depreciation reduction may not exceed the amount necessary for the retail ROE, as reported to the Florida PSC monthly, to reach the midpoint of the authorized retail ROE range then in effect. For 2014 and   2015  , Gulf Power recognized reductions in depreciation of   $8.4 million   and   $20.1 million  , respectively. In the   third quarter 2016   and in accordance with the 2013 Rate Case Settlement Agreement, Gulf Power reversed reductions previously recorded to depreciation. As a result, for the first   nine   months of   2016  , the net reduction in depreciation was   zero  . 
  On October 12, 2016, Gulf Power filed a petition (2016 Rate Case) with the Florida PSC requesting an increase in retail rates and charges of   $106.8 million   based on the projected test year of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and a retail ROE of   11%   compared to the current retail ROE of   10.25%  . The recoverability of the costs associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 will be decided in this matter. The Florida PSC is expected to make a decision on the 2016 Rate Case in the second quarter 2017. Gulf Power has requested that the increase in base rates, if approved by the Florida PSC, become effective in July 2017. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Cost Recovery Clauses 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Gulf Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Cost Recovery Clauses" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Gulf Power's recovery of retail costs through various regulatory clauses and accounting orders. Gulf Power has   four   regulatory clauses which are approved by the Florida PSC. The balance of each regulatory clause recovery on the balance sheet follows:

On November 2, 2016, the Florida PSC approved Gulf Power's annual rate clause request for its fuel, purchased power capacity, environmental, and energy conservation cost recovery factors for 2017. The net effect of the approved changes is a   $41 million   decrease in annual revenues for 2017. In general, the decreased revenues will not have a significant impact on net income since most of the revenues will be offset by lower expenses. However, certain costs associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 were included in the environmental clause rate, which will have an impact of approximately   $11 million   and   $14 million   of additional revenue in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The final disposition of these costs and the related impact on rates is expected to be decided by the Florida PSC in the 2016 Rate Case as discussed previously. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Other Matters 
  As a result of the cost to comply with environmental regulations imposed by the EPA, Gulf Power retired its coal-fired generation at Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 (  357   MWs) on March 31, 2016. Gulf Power filed a petition with the

Florida PSC requesting permission to recover the remaining net book value of Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 and the remaining materials and supplies associated with these units as of the retirement date. In connection with this request, Gulf Power reclassified approximately   $63 million   to a regulatory asset, including the remaining net book value of the units and the associated materials and supplies. On August 29, 2016, the Florida PSC approved Gulf Power's request to create a regulatory asset and defer the recovery over a period to be decided in the 2016 Rate Case. 
  Mississippi Power 
  Energy Efficiency 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Energy Efficiency" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Mississippi Power's energy efficiency programs. 
  On May 3, 2016, the Mississippi PSC issued an order approving the annual Energy Efficiency Cost Rider Compliance filing, which included an anticipated reduction of   $2 million   in retail revenues for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
  Performance Evaluation Plan 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Performance Evaluation Plan" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Mississippi Power's base rates. 
  On April 1, 2016, Mississippi Power submitted its annual PEP lookback filing for 2015, which reflected the need for a   $5 million   surcharge to be recovered from customers. The filing has been suspended for review by the Mississippi PSC. 
  On July 12, 2016, Mississippi Power submitted its annual projected PEP filing for 2016 which indicated no change in rates. The filing has been suspended for review by the Mississippi PSC. 
  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Environmental Compliance Overview Plan 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Environmental Compliance Overview Plan" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Mississippi Power's ECO Plan. 
  On August 17, 2016, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's revised ECO Plan filing for 2016, which requested the maximum   2%   annual increase in revenues, approximately   $18 million  , primarily related to Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 scrubbers being placed in service in November 2015. The revised rates became effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016. Approximately   $22 million   of related revenue requirements in excess of the   2%   maximum was deferred for inclusion in the 2017 filing. 
  Fuel Cost Recovery 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters   Fuel Cost Recovery" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding Mississippi Power's retail fuel cost recovery. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the amount of over-recovered retail fuel costs included on Mississippi Power's Condensed Balance Sheet was   $58 million   compared to   $71 million   at December 31, 2015. 
  The Mississippi PSC conditionally approved a decrease of   $120 million   annually in fuel cost recovery rates on January 5, 2016, effective with the first billing cycle for February 2016. On August 17, 2016, the Mississippi PSC approved an additional decrease of   $51 million   annually in fuel cost recovery rates effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016.

Southern Company Gas 
  Natural Gas Cost Recovery 
  Southern Company Gas has established natural gas cost recovery rates approved by the relevant state regulatory agencies in the states in which it serves. Natural gas cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable natural gas costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's revenues or net income, but will affect cash flow. 
  Regulatory Infrastructure Programs 
  Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are involved in ongoing capital projects associated with infrastructure improvement programs that have been previously approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies and provide an appropriate return on invested capital. These infrastructure improvement programs update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the utilities to improve safety and reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. Southern Company Gas currently has approved infrastructure improvement programs in   six   different states with initial program lengths ranging from   four   to   10 years  , with the longest set to expire in 2025. The average annual spend under these programs ranges from   $10 million   to   $250 million  . 
  Southern Company Gas currently has proposed infrastructure improvement programs pending approval by the applicable state regulatory agencies in Georgia and New Jersey requesting average annual spending of   $44 million   through 2020 and   $110 million   through 2027, respectively. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle 
  See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding Mississippi Power's construction of the Kemper IGCC. 
  Kemper IGCC Overview 
  The Kemper IGCC will utilize an IGCC technology with an expected output capacity of   582   MWs. The Kemper IGCC will be fueled by locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal) from a mine owned by Mississippi Power and situated adjacent to the Kemper IGCC. The mine, operated by North American Coal Corporation, started commercial operation in 2013. In connection with the Kemper IGCC, Mississippi Power constructed and plans to operate approximately   61   miles of CO   2    pipeline infrastructure for the planned transport of captured CO   2    for use in enhanced oil recovery. 
  Kemper IGCC Schedule and Cost Estimate 
  In 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order, a detailed order confirming the CPCN originally approved by the Mississippi PSC in 2010 authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the Kemper IGCC. The certificated cost estimate of the Kemper IGCC included in the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order was   $2.4 billion  , net of   $245 million   of grants awarded to the Kemper IGCC project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2 (Initial DOE Grants) and excluding the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO   2    pipeline facilities, and AFUDC related to the Kemper IGCC. The 2012 MPSC CPCN Order approved a construction cost cap of up to   $2.88 billion  , with recovery of prudently-incurred costs subject to approval by the Mississippi PSC. The Kemper IGCC was originally projected to be placed in service in May 2014. Mississippi Power placed the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper IGCC in service in August 2014 and continues to progress towards completing the remainder of the Kemper IGCC, including the gasifiers and the gas clean-up facilities. The initial production of syngas began on July 14, 2016 for gasifier "B" and on September 13, 2016 for gasifier "A." On October 11, 2016, the Kemper IGCC began testing using clean syngas from gasifier "A" and the related gas clean-up systems to produce electricity. Late on October 31, 2016, gasifier "A" experienced challenges associated with the ash removal systems, and on November 2, 2016, Mississippi Power determined a maintenance outage on gasifier "A" is needed to make improvements to the ash removal systems.  
  
   173 

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

Therefore, Mississippi Power has re-sequenced activities, and gasifier "B" is now expected to progress through testing and begin producing electricity during the gasifier "A" outage. In light of these changes, Mississippi Power has determined that integrated operation of both gasifiers will not occur by mid-November and has revised the expected in-service date for the remainder of the Kemper IGCC to December 31, 2016. The remaining schedule reflects the time expected to achieve production of electricity using gasifier "B," complete gasifier "A" outage activities, and resume electricity production using gasifier "A," as well as to complete the integration of all systems necessary for both combustion turbines to simultaneously generate electricity with syngas. 
  Recovery of the costs subject to the cost cap and the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO   2    pipeline facilities, AFUDC, and certain general exceptions, including change of law, force majeure, and beneficial capital (which exists when Mississippi Power demonstrates that the purpose and effect of the construction cost increase is to produce efficiencies that will result in a neutral or favorable effect on customers relative to the original proposal for the CPCN) (Cost Cap Exceptions) remains subject to review and approval by the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power's Kemper IGCC 2010 project estimate, current cost estimate (which includes the impacts of the Mississippi Supreme Court's (Court) decision discussed herein under "Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs   2013 MPSC Rate Order"), and actual costs incurred as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

(a) 
    The 2010 Project Estimate is the certificated cost estimate adjusted to include the certificated estimate for the CO   2    pipeline facilities approved in 2011 by the Mississippi PSC, as well as the lignite mine and equipment, AFUDC, and general exceptions. 
              (b) 
    Amounts in the Current Cost Estimate include certain estimated post-in-service costs which are expected to be subject to the cost cap. 
              (c) 
    The 2012 MPSC CPCN Order approved a construction cost cap of up to   $2.88 billion  , net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. The Current Cost Estimate and the Actual Costs include non-incremental operating and maintenance costs related to the combined cycle and associated common facilities placed in service in August 2014 that are subject to the   $2.88 billion   cost cap and exclude post-in-service costs for the lignite mine. See "  Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs       2013 MPSC Rate Order  " herein for additional information. The Current Cost Estimate and the Actual Costs reflect   100%   of the costs of the Kemper IGCC. See note (e) for additional information. 
              (d) 
    Mississippi Power's 2010 Project Estimate included recovery of financing costs during construction rather than the accrual of AFUDC. This approach was not approved by the Mississippi PSC as described in "  Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs       2013 MPSC Rate Order  ." The Current Cost Estimate also reflects the impact of a settlement agreement with the wholesale customers for cost-based rates under FERC's jurisdiction. See "  FERC Matters  " herein for additional information. 
              (e) 
    Non-capital Kemper IGCC-related costs incurred during construction were initially deferred as regulatory assets. Some of these costs are now included in rates and are being recognized through income; however, such costs continue to be included in the Current Cost Estimate and the Actual Costs at   September 30, 2016  . The wholesale portion of debt carrying costs, whether deferred or recognized through income, is not included in the Current Cost Estimate and the Actual Costs at   September 30, 2016  . See "  Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs       Regulatory Assets and Liabilities  " herein for additional information. 
              (f) 
    On April 8, 2016, Mississippi Power received approximately   $137 million   in additional grants from the DOE for the Kemper IGCC (Additional DOE Grants), which are expected to be used to reduce future rate impacts for customers.

Of the total costs, including post-in-service costs for the lignite mine, incurred as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $3.70 billion   was included in property, plant, and equipment (which is net of the Initial DOE Grants, the Additional DOE Grants, and estimated probable losses of   $2.63 billion  ),   $6 million   in other property and investments,   $81 million   in fossil fuel stock,   $46 million   in materials and supplies,   $33 million   in other regulatory assets, current,   $177 million   in other regulatory assets, deferred,   $4 million   in other current assets, and   $9 million   in other deferred charges and assets in the balance sheet. 
  Mississippi Power does not intend to seek rate recovery for any costs related to the construction of the Kemper IGCC that exceed the   $2.88 billion   cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions. Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for revisions to the cost estimate of   $88 million   (  $54 million   after tax) in the   third quarter 2016   and a total of   $222 million   (  $137 million   after tax) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Since 2012, in the aggregate, Mississippi Power has incurred charges of   $2.63 billion   (  $1.63 billion   after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through   September 30, 2016  . The increase to the cost estimate in the third quarter of 2016 primarily reflects   $53 million   for the extension of the Kemper IGCC's projected in-service date from October 31, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and increased efforts related to operational readiness and challenges in start-up and commissioning activities, including the cost of repairs and modifications to gasifier "B" and mechanical improvements to coal feed and ash management systems, as well as certain post-in-service costs expected to be subject to the cost cap. The year-to-date increase to the cost estimate also includes   $78 million   for the extension of the Kemper IGCC's projected in-service date from August 31, 2016 to October 31, 2016. I  n addition, during the start-up and commissioning process, Mississippi Power is identifying potential improvement projects that ultimately may be completed subsequent to placing the remainder of the Kemper IGCC in service. If completed, such improvement projects would be expected to enhance plant performance, safety, and/or operations. The related potential costs have yet to be fully evaluated, have not been included in the current cost estimate, and may be subject to the   $2.88 billion   cost cap. 
  Any extension of the in-service date beyond December 31, 2016 is currently estimated to result in additional base costs of approximately   $25 million   to   $35 million   per month, which includes maintaining necessary levels of start-up labor, materials, and fuel, as well as operational resources required to execute start-up and commissioning activities. However, additional costs may be required for remediation of any further equipment and/or design issues identified. Any extension of the in-service date with respect to the Kemper IGCC beyond December 31, 2016 would also increase costs for the Cost Cap Exceptions, which are not subject to the   $2.88 billion   cost cap established by the Mississippi PSC. These costs include AFUDC, which is currently estimated to total approximately   $15 million   per month, as well as carrying costs and operating expenses on Kemper IGCC assets placed in service and consulting and legal fees of approximately   $3 million   per month. For additional information, see "  2015 Rate Case  " herein. 
  Mississippi Power's analysis of the time needed to complete the start-up and commissioning activities for the Kemper IGCC will continue until the remaining Kemper IGCC assets are placed in service. The next steps for the facility include the testing and production of electricity using clean syngas from gasifier "B," as well as the generation of electricity using clean syngas from gasifier "A," which are scheduled to occur by the end of November. If integrated operation of both gasifiers does not occur by mid-December, the expected in-service date and related cost estimate for the Kemper IGCC likely would require further revision  . Further cost increases and/or extensions of the expected in-service date may result from factors including, but not limited to, difficulties integrating the systems required for sustained operations, sustaining nitrogen supply, major equipment failure, unforeseen engineering or design problems including any repairs and/or modifications to systems, and/or operational performance (including additional costs to satisfy any operational parameters ultimately adopted by the Mississippi PSC). Any further changes in the estimated costs of the Kemper IGCC subject to the   $2.88 billion   cost cap, net of the Initial DOE Grants and excluding the Cost Cap Exceptions, will be reflected in Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's statements of income and these changes could be material.

Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs 
  See "  FERC Matters  " herein for additional information regarding Mississippi Power's MRA cost based tariff relating to recovery of a portion of the Kemper IGCC costs from Mississippi Power's wholesale customers. Rate recovery of the retail portion of the Kemper IGCC is subject to the jurisdiction of the Mississippi PSC. See Note (G) under "  Unrecognized Tax Benefits       Section 174 Research and Experimental Deduction  " for additional tax information related to the Kemper IGCC. 
  The ultimate outcome of the rate recovery matters discussed herein, including the resolution of legal challenges, determinations of prudency, and the specific manner of recovery of prudently-incurred costs, cannot be determined at this time, but could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
  2012 MPSC CPCN Order 
  The 2012 MPSC CPCN Order included provisions relating to both Mississippi Power's recovery of financing costs during the course of construction of the Kemper IGCC and Mississippi Power's recovery of costs following the date the Kemper IGCC is placed in service. With respect to recovery of costs following the in-service date of the Kemper IGCC, the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order provided for the establishment of operational cost and revenue parameters based upon assumptions in Mississippi Power's petition for the CPCN. Mississippi Power expects the Mississippi PSC to apply operational parameters in connection with future proceedings related to the operation of the Kemper IGCC. To the extent the Mississippi PSC determines the Kemper IGCC does not meet the operational parameters ultimately adopted by the Mississippi PSC or Mississippi Power incurs additional costs to satisfy such parameters, there could be a material adverse impact on Southern Company's or Mississippi Power's financial statements. See "Prudence" herein for additional information. 
  2013 MPSC Rate Order 
  In January 2013, Mississippi Power entered into a settlement agreement with the Mississippi PSC that was intended to establish the process for resolving matters regarding cost recovery related to the Kemper IGCC (2013 Settlement Agreement). Under the 2013 Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power agreed to limit the portion of prudently-incurred Kemper IGCC costs to be included in retail rate base to the   $2.4 billion   certificated cost estimate, plus the Cost Cap Exceptions, but excluding AFUDC, and any other costs permitted or determined to be excluded from the   $2.88 billion   cost cap by the Mississippi PSC. In March 2013, the Mississippi PSC issued a rate order approving retail rate increases of   15%   effective March 19, 2013 and   3%   effective January 1, 2014, which collectively were designed to collect   $156 million   annually beginning in 2014 (2013 MPSC Rate Order) to be used to mitigate customer rate impacts after the Kemper IGCC is placed in service, based on a mirror CWIP methodology (Mirror CWIP rate). 
  Because the 2013 MPSC Rate Order did not provide for the inclusion of CWIP in rate base as permitted by the Baseload Act, Mississippi Power continues to record AFUDC on the Kemper IGCC. Through September 30, 2016, AFUDC recorded since the original May 2014 estimated in-service date for the Kemper IGCC has totaled   $352 million  . Mississippi Power has not recorded any AFUDC on Kemper IGCC costs in excess of the   $2.88 billion   cost cap, except for Cost Cap Exception amounts. 
  On February 12, 2015, the Court reversed the 2013 MPSC Rate Order based on, among other things, its findings that (1) the Mirror CWIP rate treatment was not provided for under the Baseload Act and (2) the Mississippi PSC should have determined the prudence of Kemper IGCC costs before approving rate recovery through the 2013 MPSC Rate Order. The Court also found the 2013 Settlement Agreement unenforceable due to a lack of public notice for the related proceedings. On July 7, 2015, the Mississippi PSC ordered that the Mirror CWIP rate be terminated effective July 20, 2015 and required the fourth quarter 2015 refund of the   $342 million   collected under the 2013 MPSC Rate Order, along with associated carrying costs of   $29 million  . The Court's decision did not impact the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order or the February 2013 legislation described below.

2015 Rate Case 
  On August 13, 2015, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's request for interim rates, which presented an alternative rate proposal (In-Service Asset Proposal) designed to recover Mississippi Power's costs associated with the Kemper IGCC assets that are commercially operational and currently providing service to customers (the transmission facilities, combined cycle, natural gas pipeline, and water pipeline) and other related costs. The interim rates were designed to collect approximately   $159 million   annually and became effective with the first billing cycle for September 2015, subject to refund and certain other conditions. 
  On December 3, 2015, the Mississippi PSC issued the In-Service Asset Rate Order adopting in full a stipulation entered into between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff (MPUS) regarding the In-Service Asset Proposal. The In-Service Asset Rate Order provided for retail rate recovery of an annual revenue requirement of approximately   $126 million  , based on Mississippi Power's actual average capital structure, with a maximum common equity percentage of   49.733%  , a   9.225%   return on common equity, and actual embedded interest costs. The In-Service Asset Rate Order also included a prudence finding of all costs in the stipulated revenue requirement calculation for the in-service assets. The stipulated revenue requirement excluded the costs of the Kemper IGCC related to the   15%   undivided interest that was previously projected to be purchased by SMEPA. Mississippi Power continues to evaluate its alternatives with respect to its investment and related costs associated with the   15%   undivided interest. 
  With implementation of the new rates on December 17, 2015, the interim rates were terminated and, in March 2016, Mississippi Power completed customer refunds of approximately   $11 million   for the difference between the interim rates collected and the permanent rates. 
  On July 27, 2016, the Court dismissed Greenleaf CO   2    Solutions, LLC (Greenleaf) motion for reconsideration of its previous decision to dismiss Greenleaf's appeal of the In-Service Asset Rate Order. 
  In addition to current estimated costs at   September 30, 2016   of   $6.82 billion  , Mississippi Power anticipates that it will incur additional expenses in excess of current rates associated with operating the Kemper IGCC after it is placed in service until the Kemper IGCC cost recovery approach is finalized, which are expected to be material. These costs include, but are not limited to, regulatory costs, operational costs in excess of current rates, taxes, and additional carrying costs. Mississippi Power expects to request authority from the Mississippi PSC and the FERC to defer all Kemper IGCC costs incurred after the in-service date that cannot be capitalized, are not included in current rates, and are not required to be charged against earnings as a result of the   $2.88 billion   cost cap until such time as the Mississippi PSC completes its review and includes the resulting allowable costs in rates. Mississippi Power is required to file its next rate request with the Mississippi PSC related to cost recovery for the Kemper IGCC by June 3, 2017. See "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" below for additional information. As part of that filing, Mississippi Power expects to request recovery of certain costs that the Mississippi PSC had excluded from the revenue requirement calculation for the in-service assets. 
  Legislation to authorize a multi-year rate plan and legislation to provide for alternate financing through securitization of up to   $1.0 billion   of prudently-incurred costs was enacted into law in 2013. Mississippi Power expects to securitize prudently-incurred qualifying facility costs in excess of the certificated cost estimate of   $2.4 billion  . Qualifying facility costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs, construction costs, regulatory costs, and accrued AFUDC. The Court's decision regarding the 2013 MPSC Rate Order did not impact Mississippi Power's ability to utilize alternate financing through securitization or the February 2013 legislation. 
  Prudence 
  On August 17, 2016, the Mississippi PSC issued an order establishing a discovery docket to manage all filings related to the prudence of the Kemper IGCC. On October 3, 2016, Mississippi Power made a required compliance filing, which included a review and explanation of differences between the Kemper IGCC project estimate set forth in the 2010 CPCN proceeding and the most recent Kemper IGCC project estimate, as well as comparisons of current cost estimates and current expected plant operational parameters to the estimates presented in the 2010 CPCN proceedings for the first   five years   following the start of commercial operations. Certain costs, including  
  
   177 

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

operations and maintenance, are materially higher than the amounts presented in the CPCN proceedings. Additionally, while the current estimated operational availability estimates reflect ultimate results similar to those presented in the 2010 CPCN proceedings, the ramp up period for the current estimates reflects a lower starting point and a slower escalation rate. Mississippi Power expects the Mississippi PSC to address these issues in connection with its next rate request. 
  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 
  Consistent with the treatment of non-capital costs incurred during the pre-construction period, the Mississippi PSC issued an accounting order in 2011 granting Mississippi Power the authority to defer all non-capital Kemper IGCC-related costs to a regulatory asset through the in-service date, subject to review of such costs by the Mississippi PSC. Such costs include, but are not limited to, carrying costs on Kemper IGCC assets currently placed in service, costs associated with Mississippi PSC and MPUS consultants, prudence costs, legal fees, and operating expenses associated with assets placed in service. 
  In August 2014, Mississippi Power requested confirmation by the Mississippi PSC of Mississippi Power's authority to defer all operating expenses associated with the operation of the combined cycle subject to review of such costs by the Mississippi PSC. In addition, Mississippi Power is authorized to accrue carrying costs on the unamortized balance of such regulatory assets at a rate and in a manner to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future cost recovery mechanism proceedings. Beginning in the third quarter 2015 and the second quarter 2016, in connection with the implementation of retail and wholesale rates, respectively, Mississippi Power began expensing certain ongoing project costs and certain retail debt carrying costs (associated with assets placed in service and other non-CWIP accounts) that previously were deferred as regulatory assets and began amortizing certain regulatory assets associated with assets placed in service and consulting and legal fees. The amortization periods for these regulatory assets vary from   two years   to   10 years   as set forth in the In-Service Asset Rate Order and the settlement agreement with wholesale customers. As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance associated with these regulatory assets was   $105 million  , of which   $33 million   is included in current assets. Other regulatory assets associated with the remainder of the Kemper IGCC totaled   $105 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The amortization period for these assets is expected to be determined by the Mississippi PSC in future rate proceedings following completion of construction and start-up of the Kemper IGCC and related prudence reviews. See "  FERC Matters  " herein for information related to the 2016 settlement agreement with wholesale customers. 
  The In-Service Asset Rate Order requires Mississippi Power to submit an annual true-up calculation of its actual cost of capital, compared to the stipulated total cost of capital, with the first occurring as of May 31, 2016. At   September 30, 2016  , Mississippi Power's related regulatory liability included in its balance sheet totaled approximately   $7 million  . See "  2015 Rate Case  " herein for additional information. 
  See Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Mississippi Power under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Lignite Mine and CO   2    Pipeline Facilities 
  In conjunction with the Kemper IGCC, Mississippi Power will own the lignite mine and equipment and has acquired and will continue to acquire mineral reserves located around the Kemper IGCC site. The mine started commercial operation in June 2013. 
  In 2010, Mississippi Power executed a   40  -year management fee contract with Liberty Fuels Company, LLC (Liberty Fuels), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, which developed, constructed, and is operating and managing the mining operations. The contract with Liberty Fuels is effective through the end of the mine reclamation. As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. In addition to the obligation to fund the reclamation activities, Mississippi Power currently provides working capital support to Liberty Fuels through cash advances for capital purchases, payroll, and other operating expenses.

Note 1 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power under "Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal" and "Variable Interest Entities" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  In addition, Mississippi Power has constructed and will operate the CO   2    pipeline for the planned transport of captured CO   2    for use in enhanced oil recovery. Mississippi Power entered into agreements with Denbury Onshore (Denbury) and Treetop Midstream Services, LLC (Treetop), pursuant to which Denbury would purchase   70%   of the CO   2    captured from the Kemper IGCC and Treetop would purchase   30%   of the CO   2    captured from the Kemper IGCC. On June 3, 2016, Mississippi Power cancelled its contract with Treetop and amended its contract with Denbury to reflect, among other things, Denbury's agreement to purchase   100%   of the CO   2    captured from the Kemper IGCC, an initial contract term of   16   years, and termination rights if Mississippi Power has not satisfied its contractual obligation to deliver captured CO   2    by July 1, 2017, in addition to Denbury's existing termination rights in the event of a change in law, force majeure, or an event of default by Mississippi Power. Any termination or material modification of the agreement with Denbury could impact the operations of the Kemper IGCC and result in a material reduction in Mississippi Power's revenues to the extent Mississippi Power is not able to enter into other similar contractual arrangements or otherwise sequester the CO   2    produced. Additionally, sustained oil price reductions could result in significantly lower revenues than Mississippi Power forecasted to be available to offset customer rate impacts, which could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. 
  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Litigation 
  On April 26, 2016, a complaint against Mississippi Power was filed in Harrison County Circuit Court (Circuit Court) by Biloxi Freezing   Processing Inc., Gulfside Casino Partnership, and John Carlton Dean, which was amended and refiled on July 11, 2016 to include, among other things, Southern Company as a defendant. O  n August 12, 2016, Southern Company and Mississippi Power removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, where the case is currently pending. However, the plaintiffs have filed a request to remand the case back to state court  . The individual plaintiff, John Carlton Dean, alleges that Mississippi Power and Southern Company violated the Mississippi Unfair Trade Practices Act. All plaintiffs have alleged that Mississippi Power and Southern Company concealed, falsely represented, and failed to fully disclose important facts concerning the cost and schedule of the Kemper IGCC and that these alleged breaches have unjustly enriched Mississippi Power and Southern Company. The plaintiffs seek unspecified actual damages and punitive damages; ask the Circuit Court to appoint a receiver to oversee, operate, manage, and otherwise control all affairs relating to the Kemper IGCC; ask the Circuit Court to revoke any licenses or certificates authorizing Mississippi Power or Southern Company to engage in any business related to the Kemper IGCC in Mississippi; and seek attorney's fees, costs, and interest. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prevent any Kemper IGCC costs from being charged to customers through electric rates. 
  On June 9, 2016, Treetop, Greenleaf, Tenrgys, LLC, Tellus Energy, LLC, WCOA, LLC, and Tellus Operating Group filed a complaint against Mississippi Power, Southern Company, and SCS in the state court in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The complaint relates to the cancelled CO   2    contract with Treetop and alleges fraudulent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, civil conspiracy, and breach of contract on the part of Mississippi Power, Southern Company, and SCS and seeks compensatory damages of   $100 million  , as well as unspecified punitive damages. Southern Company, Mississippi Power, and SCS have moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the terms of the CO   2    contract. 
  Southern Company and Mississippi Power believe these legal challenges have no merit; however, an adverse outcome in these proceedings could impact Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Southern Company and Mississippi Power will vigorously defend themselves in these matters, and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

    Includes the investment securities pledged to creditors and collateral received and excludes payables related to the securities lending program. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $42 million   of the fair market value of Georgia Power's nuclear decommissioning trust funds' securities were on loan to creditors under the funds' managers' securities lending program. 
     Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power continue to elect the option to fair value investment securities held in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds. The fair value of the funds at Southern Company, including reinvested interest and dividends and excluding the funds' expenses, increased by   $49 million   and   $116 million  , respectively, for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and decreased by   $65 million   and   $33 million  , respectively, for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Alabama Power recorded an increase in fair value of   $26 million   and   $66 million  , respectively, for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and a decrease in fair value of   $39 million   and   $19 million  , respectively, for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as a change in regulatory liabilities related to its AROs. Georgia Power recorded an increase in fair value of   $23 million   and   $50 million  , respectively, for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and a decrease in fair value of   $26 million   and   $14 million  , respectively, for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as a change in its regulatory asset related to its AROs. 
  Valuation Methodologies 
  The energy-related derivatives primarily consist of exchange-traded and over-the-counter financial products for natural gas and physical power products, including, from time to time, basis swaps. These are standard products used within the energy industry and are valued using the market approach. The inputs used are mainly from observable market sources, such as forward natural gas prices, power prices, implied volatility, and overnight index swap interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are also standard over-the-counter products that are valued using observable market data and assumptions commonly used by market participants. The fair value of interest rate derivatives reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of future interest rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, and occasionally, implied volatility of interest rate options. The fair value of cross-currency swaps reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market's expectation of future foreign currency exchange rates. Additional inputs to the net present  
  
   182 

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, and discount rates. The interest rate derivatives and cross-currency swaps are categorized as Level 2 under Fair Value Measurements as these inputs are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments. See Note (H) for additional information on how these derivatives are used. 
  The NRC requires licensees of commissioned nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. For fair value measurements of the investments within the nuclear decommissioning trusts, external pricing vendors are designated for each asset class with each security specifically assigned a primary pricing source. For investments held within commingled funds, fair value is determined at the end of each business day through the net asset value, which is established by obtaining the underlying securities' individual prices from the primary pricing source. A market price secured from the primary source vendor is then evaluated by management in its valuation of the assets within the trusts. As a general approach, fixed income market pricing vendors gather market data (including indices and market research reports) and integrate relative credit information, observed market movements, and sector news into proprietary pricing models, pricing systems, and mathematical tools. Dealer quotes and other market information, including live trading levels and pricing analysts' judgments, are also obtained when available. See Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power under "Nuclear Decommissioning" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Southern Power has contingent payment obligations related to certain acquisitions whereby Southern Power is obligated to pay generation-based payments to the seller over a   10  -year period beginning at the commercial operation date. The obligation is measured at fair value using significant inputs such as forecasted facility generation in MW-hours, a fixed dollar amount per MW-hour, and a discount rate, and is evaluated periodically. The fair value of contingent consideration reflects the net present value of expected payments and any change arising from forecasted generation is expected to be immaterial. 
  "Other investments" include investments that are not traded in the open market. The fair value of these investments have been determined based on market factors including comparable multiples and the expectations regarding cash flows and business plan executions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value measurements of private equity investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trust that are calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient, as well as the nature and risks of those investments, were as follows:

     Earnings per Share 
  For Southern Company, the only difference in computing basic and diluted earnings per share is attributable to awards outstanding under the stock option and performance share plans. See Note 8 to the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information on the stock option and performance share plans. The effect of both stock options and performance share award units was determined using the treasury stock method. Shares used to compute diluted earnings per share were as follows: 

Stock options and performance share award units that were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive were immaterial for the   three   and     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and were   15 million   and   1 million   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

    FINANCING 
     Bank Credit Arrangements 
  Bank credit arrangements provide liquidity support to the registrants' commercial paper borrowings and the traditional electric operating companies' pollution control revenue bonds. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $1.9 billion   (comprised of approximately   $890 million   at Alabama Power,   $868 million   at Georgia Power,   $82 million   at Gulf Power, and   $40 million   at Mississippi Power). In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , the traditional electric operating companies had approximately   $358 million   (comprised of approximately   $87 million   at Alabama Power,   $250 million   at Georgia Power, and   $21 million   at Gulf Power) of fixed rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding that were required to be reoffered within the next 12 months. See Note 6 to the financial statements of each registrant under "Bank Credit Arrangements" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K and "  Financing Activities  " herein for additional information. 
  The following table outlines the committed credit arrangements by company as of   September 30, 2016  :

    INCOME TAXES 
     See Note 5 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional tax information. 
  Current and Deferred Income Taxes 
  Net Operating Loss 
  Southern Company expects to be in a consolidated net operating loss (NOL) position for income tax purposes for the 2016 tax year. The NOL will limit the amount of positive cash flows resulting from bonus depreciation, ITCs, and PTCs for the tax year and will significantly increase deferred tax assets for the NOL and tax credit carryforwards. Portions of the NOL are expected to be carried back to prior tax years   and forward to the 2017 tax year, which could further increase existing tax credit carryforwards  . The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Tax Credit Carryforwards    
  Southern Company had federal ITC and PTC carryforwards (primarily related to Southern Power) totaling   $1.2 billion   and   $26 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   $554 million   and   $1 million  , respectively, as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, Southern Company had   $165 million   of state ITC carryforwards for the state of Georgia as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $188 million   as of December 31, 2015. See "  Unrecognized Tax Benefits  " herein for further information. 
  The federal ITC carryforwards as of   September 30, 2016   begin expiring in 2034 but are expected to be utilized by the end of 2021. The PTC carryforwards as of   September 30, 2016   begin expiring in 2035 but are expected to be utilized by the end of 2021. The state ITC carryforwards for the state of Georgia as of   September 30, 2016   expire between 2020 and 2026 but are expected to be fully utilized by the end of 2022. 
  Effective Tax Rate 
  Southern Company 
  Southern Company's effective tax rate is typically lower than the statutory rate due to employee stock plans' dividend deduction, non-taxable AFUDC equity, and federal income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs. 
  Southern Company's effective tax rate was   29.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   33.5%   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The effective tax rate decrease was primarily due to increased federal income tax benefits from ITCs and PTCs at Southern Power, partially offset by the impact of additional state income tax benefits recognized in   2015  . 
  Mississippi Power 
  Mississippi Power's effective tax (benefit) rate was   (276.2)%     for the nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to   (20.9)%   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The effective tax rate decrease was primarily due to an increase in tax benefits related to the estimated probable losses on construction of the Kemper IGCC and an increase in non-taxable AFUDC equity. 
  Southern Power 
  Southern Power's effective tax (benefit) rate was   (88.9)%     for the nine months ended September 30,     2016   compared to   6.9%   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The effective tax rate decrease was primarily due to increased federal income tax benefits from ITCs related to solar projects expected to be placed in service in   2016   and additional PTCs related to wind projects in   2016   compared to   2015  . 
  Unrecognized Tax Benefits

Changes during   2016   for unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: 

The tax positions from current periods primarily relate to federal income tax benefits from deferred ITCs and ITCs impacting the estimated annual effective tax rate for interim reporting purposes. The tax positions from prior periods primarily relate to federal income tax benefits from ITCs, and from deductions for Kemper IGCC-related research and experimental (R E) expenditures. See "  Section 174 Research and Experimental Deduction  " below for additional information. These amounts are presented on a gross basis without considering the related federal or state income tax impact. 
  The impact on the effective tax rate, if recognized, is as follows: 

The tax positions impacting the effective tax rate primarily relate to federal income tax benefits from ITCs and Southern Company's estimate of the uncertainty related to the amount of those benefits. The impact on the effective tax rate is determined based on the amount of ITCs, which is uncertain. If these tax positions are not able to be recognized due to a federal audit adjustment equal to the estimated amount, the amount of tax credit carryforwards discussed above would be reduced by approximately   $94 million  .  
  Accrued interest for all tax positions other than Section 174 R E deductions disclosed below was immaterial for all periods presented. 
  All of the registrants classify interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. None of the registrants accrued any penalties on uncertain tax positions. 
  It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits could change within   12 months  . The settlement of federal and state audits could impact the balances significantly. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be determined. 
  The IRS has finalized its audits of Southern Company's consolidated federal income tax returns through 2012. Southern Company has filed its 2013, 2014, and 2015 federal income tax returns and has received partial acceptance letters from the IRS; however, the IRS has not finalized its audits. Southern Company is a participant in the Compliance Assurance Process of the IRS. The audits for the Southern Company's state income tax returns have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2011.

Section 174 Research and Experimental Deduction 
  Southern Company has reflected deductions for R E expenditures related to the Kemper IGCC in its federal income tax calculations since 2013 and has filed amended federal income tax returns for 2008 through 2013 to also include such deductions. 
  The Kemper IGCC is based on first-of-a-kind technology, and Southern Company and Mississippi Power believe that a significant portion of the plant costs qualify as deductible R E expenditures under Internal Revenue Code Section 174. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, Southern Company and Mississippi Power responded to a notice of proposed assessment from the IRS, which is continuing to review the underlying support for the deduction. Due to the uncertainty related to this tax position, Southern Company and Mississippi Power had related unrecognized tax benefits associated with these R E deductions of approximately   $438 million   and associated interest of   $24 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . It is reasonably possible that this matter will be resolved in the next   12   months; however, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
   
           (H) 
    DERIVATIVES 
     Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas are exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, each company nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to each company's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net basis. See Note (C) for additional information. In the statements of cash flows, the cash impacts of settled energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities. The cash impacts of settled foreign currency derivatives are classified as operating or financing activities to correspond with classification of the hedged interest or principal, respectively. 
  Energy-Related Derivatives 
  Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas enter into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, natural gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices. Each of the traditional electric operating companies and certain natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs, implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies, through the use of financial derivative contracts, which is expected to continue to mitigate price volatility. The traditional electric operating companies (with respect to wholesale generating capacity), Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have limited exposure to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices because their long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas may be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices to the extent any uncontracted capacity is used to sell electricity and natural gas. 
  Southern Company Gas uses storage and transportation capacity contracts to manage market price risks. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas for storage when the current market price paid to buy and transport natural gas plus the cost to store and finance the natural gas is less than the market price Southern Company Gas will receive in the future, resulting in a positive net operating margin. Southern Company Gas uses New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially protect the operating margin ultimately realized when the stored natural gas is sold. Southern Company Gas also enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to  
  
   195 

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

serve its customers and various markets. Southern Company Gas uses NYMEX futures and OTC contracts to capture the price differential between the locations served by the capacity in order to substantially protect the operating margin ultimately realized when natural gas is physically flowed between the delivery points. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives, but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 
  Southern Company Gas also enters into weather derivative contracts as economic hedges of operating margins in the event of warmer-than-normal weather. Exchange-traded options are carried at fair value, with changes reflected in operating revenues. Non exchange-traded options are accounted for using the intrinsic value method. Changes in the intrinsic value for non-exchange-traded contracts are reflected in the statements of income. 
  Energy-related derivative contracts are accounted for under one of three methods: 
             
    Regulatory Hedges     Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Company Gas' fuel-hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through the respective fuel cost recovery clauses. 
                
    Cash Flow Hedges     Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales) are initially deferred in OCI before being recognized in the statements of income in the same period as the hedged transactions are reflected in earnings. 
                
    Not Designated     Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred. 
     Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the net volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions for the Southern Company system, together with the longest hedge date over which the respective entity is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and the longest non-hedge date for derivatives not designated as hedges, were as follows: 

(*) 
    Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. Southern Company Gas' volume represents the net of long natural gas positions of   3.2 billion   mmBtu and short natural gas positions of   2.9 billion   mmBtu as of September 30, 2016. 
     In addition to the volumes discussed in the above table, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power enter into physical natural gas supply contracts that provide the option to sell back excess gas due to operational constraints. The maximum expected volume of natural gas subject to such a feature is   5 million   mmBtu for Southern Company and Georgia Power.

For cash flow hedges, the amounts expected to be reclassified from accumulated OCI to earnings for the next   12  -month period ending   September 30, 2017   are immaterial for all registrants. 
  Interest Rate Derivatives 
  Southern Company and certain subsidiaries may also enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness. Derivatives related to existing variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the effective portion of the derivatives' fair value gains or losses is recorded in OCI and is reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged transactions affect earnings, with any ineffectiveness recorded directly to earnings. Derivatives related to existing fixed rate securities are accounted for as fair value hedges, where the derivatives' fair value gains or losses and hedged items' fair value gains or losses are both recorded directly to earnings, providing an offset, with any difference representing ineffectiveness. Fair value gains or losses on derivatives that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

Foreign Currency Derivatives 
  Southern Company and certain subsidiaries may also enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, such as that arising from the issuance of debt denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Derivatives related to forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the effective portion of the derivatives' fair value gains or losses is recorded in OCI and is reclassified into earnings at the same time that the hedged transactions affect earnings, including currency gains or losses arising from changes in the U.S. currency exchange rates. Any ineffectiveness is recorded directly to earnings. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the following foreign currency derivatives were outstanding:   

  The estimated pre-tax gains (losses) that will be reclassified from accumulated OCI to earnings for the next   12  -month period ending   September 30, 2017   are   $(12) million   for Southern Company and Southern Power. 
  Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts 
  Derivative contracts of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas are presented on a net basis in the financial statements to the extent that the contracts are subject to netting arrangements. Some of these energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts may contain certain provisions that permit intra-contract netting of derivative receivables and payables for routine billing and offsets related to events of default and settlements.

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the pre-tax effects of interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments were offset by changes to the carrying value of long-term debt. 
  There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any registrant for any period presented. 
  For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the pre-tax effects of energy-related derivatives and interest rate derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were immaterial for all registrants.  
  Contingent Features 
  Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas do not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. At   September 30, 2016  , Southern Company had   $111 million   of collateral posted with derivative counterparties. The amount of collateral posted with the derivative counterparties for all other registrants was immaterial. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivative liabilities with contingent features was   $22 million   for all registrants. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were   $22 million   for all registrants and include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants or Southern Company has a credit rating change to below investment grade. 
  Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. If collateral is required, fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty. 
  Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate Southern Company's, the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and Southern Company Gas' exposure to counterparty credit risk. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. Therefore, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power do not anticipate a material adverse effect on the financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. 
   
           (I) 
    ACQUISITIONS 
      
  Southern Company 
  Merger with Southern Company Gas 
  Southern Company Gas, formerly known as AGL Resources Inc., is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities. On July 1, 2016, Southern Company completed the Merger for a total purchase price of approximately   $8.0 billion   and Southern Company Gas became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Southern Company. 
  
   208 

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

The Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The following table presents the preliminary purchase price allocation: 

The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of   $5.9 billion   is recognized as goodwill, which is primarily attributable to positioning the Southern Company system to provide natural gas infrastructure to meet customers' growing energy needs and to compete for growth across the energy value chain. Southern Company anticipates that much of the value assigned to goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. The estimated fair values noted above are preliminary and are subject to change upon finalization of the purchase accounting assessment as additional information related to the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. Subsequent adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation are not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position of Southern Company. 
  The preliminary valuation of identifiable intangible assets included customer relationships, trade names, and storage and transportation contracts with estimated lives of   one   to   28 years  . The estimated fair value measurements of identifiable intangible assets were primarily based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
  The results of operations for Southern Company Gas have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and consist of operating revenues of   $543 million   and net income of   $4 million  . 
  The following summarized unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of earnings information assumes that the acquisition of Southern Company Gas was completed on January 1, 2015. The summarized unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of earnings information includes adjustments for (i) intercompany sales, (ii) amortization of intangible assets, (iii) adjustments to interest expense to reflect current interest rates on Southern Company Gas debt and additional interest expense associated with borrowings by Southern Company to fund the Merger, and (iv) the elimination of nonrecurring expenses associated with the Merger.

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

These unaudited pro forma results are for comparative purposes only and may not be indicative of the results that would have occurred had this acquisition been completed on January 1, 2015 or the results that would be attained in the future. 
  During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Southern Company recorded in its statements of income costs associated with the Merger of approximately   $40.8 million   and   $104.1 million  , respectively, of which   $40.6 million   and   $73.5 million   is included in operating expenses and   $0.2 million   and   $30.6 million   is included in other income and (expense), respectively. These costs include external transaction costs for financing, legal, and consulting services, as well as rate credits and additional compensation-related expenses. 
  See Note 12 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Southern Company   Proposed Merger with AGL Resources" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. 
  Acquisition of PowerSecure International, Inc. 
  On May 9, 2016, Southern Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of PowerSecure, a provider of products and services in the areas of distributed generation, energy efficiency, and utility infrastructure, for   $18.75   per common share in cash, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of   $429 million  . As a result, PowerSecure became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company. 
  The acquisition of PowerSecure was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting with the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The allocation of the purchase price is as follows: 

The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of   $284 million   was recognized as goodwill, which is primarily attributable to expected business expansion opportunities for PowerSecure. Southern Company anticipates that the majority of the value assigned to goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. 
  The valuation of identifiable intangible assets included customer relationships, trade names, patents, backlog, and software with estimated lives of   one   to   26   years. The estimated fair value measurements of identifiable intangible assets were primarily based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
  The results of operations for PowerSecure have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and are immaterial to the consolidated financial results of Southern Company. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for the acquisition because the effects of the acquisition were immaterial to Southern Company's consolidated financial results for all periods presented. 
  Alliance with Bloom Energy Corporation 
  O  n October 24, 2016, a subsidiary of Southern Company acquired from an affiliate of Bloom Energy Corporation (Bloom) all of the equity interests of 2016 ESA HoldCo, LLC and its subsidiary, 2016 ESA Project Company, LLC.

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: (Continued) 
  (UNAUDITED) 

2016 ESA Project Company, LLC expects to acquire   50   MWs of Bloom fuel cell systems to serve commercial and industrial customers under long-term PPAs. In connection with this transaction, PowerSecure and Bloom agreed to pursue a strategic alliance to develop technology for behind-the-meter energy solutions  . 
  Investment in Southern Natural Gas 
  On July 10, 2016, Southern Company and Kinder Morgan, Inc. (Kinder Morgan) entered into a definitive agreement for Southern Company to acquire a   50%   equity interest in SNG, which is the owner of a   7,000  -mile pipeline system connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. On August 31, 2016, Southern Company assigned its rights and obligations under the definitive agreement to a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Southern Company Gas. On September 1, 2016, Southern Company Gas completed the acquisition for a purchase price of approximately   $1.4 billion  . The investment in SNG is accounted for using the equity method. 
  Acquisition of Remaining Interest in SouthStar 
  SouthStar is a retail natural gas marketer and markets natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers, primarily in Georgia and Illinois. At September 30, 2016, Southern Company Gas had an   85%   ownership interest in SouthStar, with Piedmont owning the remaining   15%  . Subsequent to September 30, 2016, Southern Company Gas purchased Piedmont's   15%   interest in SouthStar for   $160 million  . Beginning in the fourth quarter 2016, SouthStar will be fully consolidated with Southern Company Gas. 
   
  Southern Power 
  See Note 2 to the financial statements of Southern Power and Note 12 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Southern Power" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired of Desert Stateline, Garland, Garland A, Lost Hills Blackwell, Morelos, North Star, Roserock, and Tranquillity were finalized with   no   changes to the fair values reported. 
  During   2016  , in accordance with its overall growth strategy, Southern Power or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Southern Renewable Partnerships, LLC and Southern Renewable Energy, Inc., acquired or contracted to acquire the projects discussed below. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not material. The acquisitions do not include any contingent consideration unless specifically noted.

construction debt (non-recourse to Southern Power), the total aggregate purchase price is approximately   $923 million   for the project facilities acquired during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired through the business combinations were recorded as follows:   $1.0 billion   as CWIP,   $58 million   as property, plant, and equipment,   $77 million   as an intangible asset,   $24 million   as other assets, and   $5 million   as accounts payable; however, the allocations of the purchase price to individual assets have not been finalized. The intangible asset consists of an acquired PPA that will be amortized over its   20  -year term. The estimated amortization for future periods is approximately   $1 million   in 2016 and   $4 million   per year thereafter. For East Pecos, Grant Plains, Lamesa, and Rutherford, which are currently under construction, total aggregate construction costs, excluding the acquisition costs, are expected to be   $708 million   to   $775 million  . The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  Acquisitions Subsequent to   September 30, 2016 
  Southern Power's aggregate purchase price for acquisitions subsequent to   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $873 million  . Including the minority owner Invenergy Wind Global LLC's   9.9%   ownership interest in Wake Wind, the total aggregate purchase price is approximately   $924 million  .  
  As part of Southern Power's acquisition of Mankato, which has a fully operational   375  -MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle facility, Southern Power has commenced construction of an additional   345  -MW expansion which is covered with a   20  -year PPA. Total aggregate construction costs, excluding the acquisition costs allocated to CWIP, are expected to be   $170 million   to   $190 million  . The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 
  Acquisition Agreements Executed but Not Yet Closed 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and subsequent to that date, Southern Power entered into agreements to acquire the following projects for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $1.2 billion  :  
             
    51%   ownership interest (through   100%   ownership of the class A membership interests entitling Southern Power to   51%   of all cash distributions and most of the federal tax benefits) in a   100  -MW solar facility in Nevada covered with a   20  -year PPA, which is expected to close in November 2016; 
                
    100%   ownership interests in   two   wind facilities in Texas totaling   299   MWs, the majority of which is contracted under PPAs for the first   12   to   14   years of operation and are expected to close before the end of 2016; and 
                
    100%   ownership interest in a   275  -MW wind facility in Texas, the majority of which is contracted under a   12  -year PPA and is expected to close in January 2017. 
     The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 
  The aggregate amount of revenue recognized by Southern Power related to the project facilities acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included in the condensed consolidated statements of income for year-to-date 2016 is   $14 million  . The aggregate amount of net income, excluding impacts of ITCs and PTCs, attributable to Southern Power related to the project facilities acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included in the condensed consolidated statements of income is immaterial. These businesses did not have operating revenues or activities prior to completion of construction and their assets being placed in service; therefore, supplemental pro forma information as though the acquisitions occurred as of the beginning of 2016, and for the comparable 2015 period, is not meaningful and has been omitted. 
  Construction Projects 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , in accordance with its overall growth strategy, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service, or continued construction of, the projects set forth in the following table. Through   September 30, 2016  , total costs of construction incurred for the following projects were   $3.0 billion  , of which   $1.2 billion   remains in CWIP. Including the total construction costs incurred through   September 30, 2016

(J) SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION 
  The primary business of the Southern Company system is electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and, as a result of closing the Merger, the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. The four traditional electric operating companies   Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power   are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in   four   Southeastern states. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through   seven   natural gas distribution utilities and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas marketing services, wholesale gas services, and gas midstream operations. 
  Southern Company's reportable business segments are the sale of electricity by the four traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other products and services by Southern Company Gas. Revenues from sales by Southern Power to the traditional electric operating companies were   $110 million   and   $313 million   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $104 million   and   $303 million   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The "All Other" column includes the Southern Company parent entity, which does not allocate operating expenses to business segments. Also, this category includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. These segments include products and services in the areas of distributed generation, energy efficiency, and utility infrastructure, as well as investments in telecommunications and leveraged lease projects. All other inter-segment revenues are not material.

  Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
  See the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding certain legal and administrative proceedings in which the registrants are involved. 
   
  I  tem 1A. Risk Factors. 
  See RISK FACTORS in Item 1A of the Form 10-K for a discussion of the risk factors of the registrants. Except as described below, there have been no material changes to these risk factors from those previously disclosed in the Form 10-K. 
  With the completion of the Merger, Southern Company now owns Southern Company Gas, a company whose subsidiaries own and operate a natural gas business. 
  Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is involved in several other businesses that are mainly related and complementary to its primary business including: gas marketing services including the provision of natural gas commodity and related services to customers in competitive markets or markets that provide for customer choice, wholesale gas services including natural gas storage, gas pipeline arbitrage, and natural gas asset management and/or related logistics services, and gas midstream operations including high deliverability natural gas storage facilities and select pipelines. As a result, Southern Company is now subject to risks to which it was not previously subject and Southern Company stockholders may be adversely affected by these risks. These risks include the following: 
             
    Transporting and storing natural gas involves risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.   Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, explosions, and mechanical problems, which could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of its operations. 
                
    Southern Company Gas' natural gas business faces increasing competition.   The natural gas business is highly competitive and increasingly complex. Southern Company Gas is facing increasing competition from other companies that supply energy, including electric, oil, and propane providers and, in some cases, energy marketing and trading companies. 
                
    Southern Company Gas may experience reported net income volatility due to mark-to-market accounting.   Southern Company Gas utilizes hedging instruments to lock in economic value in its wholesale natural gas segment, which are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The difference in accounting treatment for the underlying position and the financial instrument used to hedge the value of the contract can cause volatility in reported net income while the positions are open due to mark-to-market accounting.

The Series 2016C Notes will be initially issued pursuant to an exemption or exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  1933 Act ).  Beneficial interests in the Series 2016C Notes offered and sold to  qualified institutional buyers  (as defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act) in reliance upon Rule 144A under the 1933 Act shall be represented by one or more separate Global Securities (each, a  Rule 144A Global Note ).  Each Rule 144A Global Note shall bear the Rule 144A legend in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto (the  Rule 144A Legend ). Beneficial interests in the Series 2016C Notes offered and sold to purchasers outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the 1933 Act shall be represented by one or more separate Global Securities (each, a  Regulation S Global Note ) and shall bear the Regulation S legend in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto (the  Regulation S Legend ). 
  Except under the limited circumstances described below, Series 2016C Notes represented by one or more Global Securities will not be exchangeable for, and will not otherwise be issuable as, Series 2016C Notes in definitive form.  The Global Securities described above may not be transferred except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or its nominee. 
  Owners of beneficial interests in such a Global Security will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture, and no Global Security representing a Series 2016C Note shall be exchangeable, except for another Global Security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee or to a successor Depositary or its nominee.  The rights of Holders of such Global Security shall be exercised only through the Depositary. 
  Subject to the procedures of the Depositary, a Global Security shall be exchangeable for Series 2016C Notes registered in the names of persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a Depositary for such Global Security and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by the Company, or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at a time when the Depositary is required to be so  

4 

registered to act as such Depositary and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by the Company, in each case within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such cessation, (ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable, or (iii) there shall have occurred an Event of Default with respect to the Series 2016C Notes.  Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Series 2016C Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct. 
  Neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. 
   
  SECTION 106.    Transfer.    A Rule 144A Global Note may not be transferred on the Security Register except in compliance with the restrictions on transfer contained in the Rule 144A Legend and upon receipt by the Security Registrar of a completed and executed Transfer Certificate in the form contained in Exhibit A. Prior to the expiration of 40 days beginning on and including the later of (i) the day on which the offering of the Series 2016C Notes commences and (ii) the Original Issue Date (the  Distribution Compliance Period ), a Regulation S Global Note may not be transferred on the Security Register except in compliance with the restrictions on transfer contained in the Regulation S Legend and upon receipt by the Security Registrar of a completed and executed Transfer Certificate in the form contained in Exhibit A.  No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of Series 2016C Notes, but payment will be required of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. 
  The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in the Global Securities shall be effected through the Depositary, in accordance with this Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture (including applicable restrictions on transfer set forth herein, if any) and the procedures of the Depositary therefor. 
  Until the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Note to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through a Rule 144A Global Note will be made only upon receipt by the Trustee of a completed and executed Transfer Certificate in the form contained in Exhibit A from the transferor of the beneficial interest to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and the requirements of applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. 
  Transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note to a transferee who takes delivery through the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, will be made only upon receipt by the Trustee of a Transfer Certificate in the form contained in Exhibit A from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act and that, if such transfer is being made prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance  

5 

Period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System or Clearstream Banking, soci t  anonyme, Luxembourg. 
  Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Securities that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Security will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the initial Global Security and will become an interest in the other Global Security and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Security for as long as it remains such an interest. 
  Transfers of beneficial interests between a Rule 144A Global Note and a Regulation S Global Note, and other transfers relating to beneficial interests in the Global Securities, shall be reflected by endorsements of the Trustee, as custodian for DTC, on the schedules attached to such Rule 144A Global Note and Regulation S Global Note. 
  Neither the Trustee, the Security Registrar nor any transfer agent shall have any obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under the Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Series 2016C Note (including any transfers between or among Depositary participants, members or beneficial owners in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by, the terms of the Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof. 
  Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall have any liability for acts or omissions of the Depositary, for the Depositary records of beneficial interest, for any transactions between the Depositary, any participant member of the Depositary and/or beneficial owner of any interest in any Series 2016C Notes, or in respect of any transfers effected by the Depositary or by any participant member of the Depositary or any beneficial owner of any interest in any Series 2016C Notes held through any such participant member of the Depositary. 
  The Company shall not be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Series 2016C Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business fifteen (15) days before the day of the mailing of a notice pursuant to Section 1104 of the Original Indenture identifying the serial numbers of the Series 2016C Notes to be called for redemption, and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing, or (b) to register the transfer of or exchange any Series 2016C Notes theretofore selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Series 2016C Notes redeemed in part. 
   
  SECTION 107.    Redemption at the Company s Option.    At any time and from time to time prior to July 20, 2023, the Series 2016C Notes will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days  notice, at Redemption Prices equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Series 2016C Notes being redeemed and (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Series 2016C Notes being redeemed (not including  

6 

any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted (for purposes of determining present value) to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a discount rate equal to the Treasury Yield plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date. At any time and from time to time on or after July 20, 2023, the Series 2016C Notes will be subject to redemption at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days  notice, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series 2016C Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. 
  In the event of redemption of the Series 2016C Notes in part only, a new Series 2016C Note or Notes for the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name or names of the Holders thereof upon the surrender thereof. 
  Notice of redemption shall be given as provided in Section 1104 of the Original Indenture except that any such notice of redemption with respect to a redemption occurring prior to July 20, 2023 shall not specify the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.  The Trustee shall not be responsible for the calculation of such Redemption Price.  The Company shall calculate such Redemption Price and promptly notify the Trustee thereof. 
  Any redemption of less than all of the Series 2016C Notes shall, with respect to the principal thereof, be divisible by $1,000. 
   
  SECTION 108.    Information to Holders.    Upon the request of any Holder, any holder of a beneficial interest in the Series 2016C Notes, or the Trustee (on behalf of a Holder or a holder of a beneficial interest in the Series 2016C Notes), the Company will furnish such information as is specified in paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to Holders (and to holders of beneficial interests in the Series 2016C Notes), prospective purchasers of the Series 2016C Notes (and of beneficial interests in the Series 2016C Notes) who are qualified institutional buyers or to the Trustee for delivery to such Holder or prospective purchasers of the Series 2016C Notes or beneficial interests therein, as the case may be, unless, at the time of such request, the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
  Delivery of information to the Trustee pursuant to this Section 108 is for informational purposes only and the Trustee s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture. 
   
  ARTICLE 2        Miscellaneous Provisions 
   
  SECTION 201.    Recitals by Company.    The recitals in this Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture are made by the Company only and not by the Trustee, and all of the provisions contained in the Original Indenture in respect of

    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
