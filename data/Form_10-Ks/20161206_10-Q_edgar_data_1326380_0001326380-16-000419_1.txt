    General Information 

Background  
  GameStop Corp. ( GameStop,   we,   us,   our,  or the  Company ) is a global family of specialty retail brands that makes the most popular technologies affordable and simple. Within our family of brands, we are the world s largest omnichannel video game retailer, the largest AT T  ( AT T ) authorized retailer, the largest Apple  ( Apple ) certified products reseller, a Cricket Wireless TM retailer ( Cricket,  an AT T brand) and the owner of   www.thinkgeek.com  , one of the world s largest sellers of collectible pop-culture themed products. We also operate   www.kongregate.com  , a leading browser-based game site, and   Game Informer   magazine, the world's leading print and digital video game publication. We operate our business in   four   Video Game Brands segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe; and a Technology Brands segment. As of   October 29, 2016  , we operated   7,586   stores, in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, which are primarily located in major shopping malls and strip centers. 
  Through our Video Game Brands segments, we are the world's largest omnichannel video game retailer. We sell new and pre-owned video game hardware, physical and digital video game software and video game accessories, as well as new and pre-owned mobile and consumer electronics products and other merchandise primarily through our GameStop, EB Games and Micromania stores and our nine global e-commerce sites,   www.gamestop.com  ,   www.ebgames.com.au  ,   www.ebgames.co.nz  ,   www.gamestop.ca  ,   www.gamestop.it  ,   www.gamestop.ie  ,   www.gamestop.de  ,   www.gamestop.co.uk   and   www.micromania.fr  . In July 2015, we acquired Geeknet, Inc. ("Geeknet"), an online and wholesale retailer that sells collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers under the name ThinkGeek through the   www.thinkgeek.com   website. ThinkGeek also sells certain exclusive products to wholesale channel customers.

Simply Mac operates   70   stores, selling the full line of Apple products, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones; and offering Apple certified warranty and repair services.  
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) which are, in our opinion, necessary for a fair presentation of the information as of and for the periods presented. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all disclosures required under GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our annual report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the   52   weeks ended   January 30, 2016   (the  2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by us could have a significant impact on our financial results. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, the results of operations for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   are not indicative of the results to be expected for the 52 weeks ending January 28, 2017 ( fiscal 2016 ).

Restricted Cash 
  Restricted cash of   $10.1 million  ,   $9.8 million   and   $9.7 million   as of   October 29, 2016  ,   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  , respectively, consists primarily of bank deposits serving as collateral for bank guarantees issued on behalf of our foreign subsidiaries and is included in other noncurrent assets in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  Dividend 
  On   November 21, 2016  , our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend to our stockholders of   $0.37   per share of Class A Common Stock payable on   December 13, 2016   to stockholders of record at the close of business on   December 1, 2016  . Future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors. 
  Share Repurchases 
  During the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , we repurchased   1.4 million   shares of our Class A Common Stock at an average price of   $26.63   for a total of   $36.0 million  .  Subsequent to October 29, 2016 through November 29, 2016, we repurchased   0.8   million shares of our Class A Common Stock at an average price of $  22.63   for a total of $  17.1   million. 
  Recently Implemented Accounting Pronouncements 
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The standard amends the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will now be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this standard during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, utilizing prospective application as permitted. As such, certain prior period amounts have not been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the current period presentation. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 became effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this guidance as of January 31, 2016, and as a result have recast the   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016   condensed consolidated balance sheets to conform to the current period presentation. The adoption of this standard reduced previously presented prepaid expenses and other current assets by   $1.3 million  , other noncurrent assets by   $3.6 million  , and long-term debt by   $4.9 million   for the period ended   October 31, 2015   based upon the balance of unamortized debt financing costs relating to our senior notes due in 2019. The adoption of this standard also reduced previously presented prepaid expenses and other current assets by   $1.3 million  , other noncurrent assets by   $3.3 million  , and long-term debt by   $4.6 million  , for the period ended   January 30, 2016   based upon the balance of unamortized debt financing costs relating to our senior notes due in 2019. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues in regard to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in the ASU should be adopted on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case the amendments should be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The update simplifies several aspects of accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We do not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The standard addresses the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard. The ASU clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e. the specified good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04, Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products.  The standard specifies how prepaid stored-value product liabilities should be derecognized, thereby eliminating the current and potential future diversity in practice. Consistent with ASU 2014-09 related to revenue recognition, the standard requires derecognition in proportion with the rights expected to be exercised by the holder. Entities may adopt this standard using either a modified retrospective transition approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings or a full retrospective transition approach. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not anticipate that adoption of this standard will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The standard requires a lessee to recognize a liability related to lease payments and an offsetting right-of-use asset representing a right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective transition approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain reliefs available. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the overall impact to our consolidated financial statements, though we expect the adoption to result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. 
  In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 related to revenue recognition. The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance. Entities may use either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition approach. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 one year, making it effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 while also providing for early adoption as of the original effective date. We anticipate that the standard will affect the way that we recognize liabilities for our customer incentives.  We are currently continuing to evaluate the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements as well as the appropriate method of adoption.

    Acquisitions 

Midwest Cellular 
  On May 31, 2016, in connection with the continued expansion of our Technology Brands segment, Spring Mobile completed the acquisition of certain assets of an AT T authorized retailer, Midwest Cellular, comprised of   71   stores for cash consideration of   $47.0   million. The acquisition was funded with proceeds from our   $475.0   million unsecured senior notes due in March 2021. We recorded   $42.7   million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to this acquisition. The pro forma effect of this acquisition is not material to our consolidated financial statements.  
  Cellular World   Red Skye Wireless 
  On August 2, 2016, in connection with the continued expansion of our Technology Brands segment, Spring Mobile completed the acquisition of certain assets comprised of   436   stores from   two   authorized AT T retailers, Cellular World and Red Skye Wireless. The purchase price consisted of $  393.2   million in cash (net of $0.1 million of cash acquired), which includes the effect of working capital adjustments, and future contingent consideration that we estimate will range from $  40.0   million to $  50.0   million. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with remaining proceeds from our   $475.0   million unsecured senior notes due in March 2021 combined with a draw on our revolving credit facility.

The contingent consideration includes two potential payments: (i) a   $20.0 million   payment contingent on the relocation of certain acquired stores to be completed by Cellular World, due the latter of August 2017 or when relocations are completed and (ii) an earn-out payment due in March 2018, contingent on the sales performance of certain acquired stores during calendar year 2017. We estimate that the second payment will range from   $20.0 million   to   $30.0 million  . We recognized an acquisition-date liability of   $43.2 million   representing the total estimated fair value of the contingent consideration; see Note 5, Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments, for additional information. 
  The estimated purchase price of the acquisition totaled   $436.4 million  , which includes the cash payment of   $393.2 million   plus the fair value of the contingent consideration of   $43.2 million  . The following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in millions): 

As of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we had not completed the final fair value assignments related to this acquisition and continue to analyze certain matters related to the valuation of certain noncurrent assets, acquired operating leases and deferred income taxes. The goodwill recognized reflects the acquired assembled workforce and Spring Mobile's entrance into new domestic regional markets. The goodwill recognized is assigned to the Technology Brands segment and is deductible for tax purposes. The intangible asset recognized for dealer agreements represents the value associated with the exclusive agreements with AT T to operate the acquired stores. The intangible asset for dealer agreements is indefinite lived and not subject to amortization, but is subject to annual impairment testing. 
  Subsequent to the acquisition date, the stores acquired from Cellular World and Red Skye Wireless contributed   $66.9 million   in net sales for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016. Pro forma information cannot be presented due to the impracticability of obtaining separately identifiable historical financial data for the acquired stores. 
   
                 3. 
    Stock-Based Compensation 

The following is a summary of the stock-based awards granted during the periods indicated:

  GAMESTOP CORP. 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For restricted stock awards and stock options granted, we record stock-based compensation expense in earnings based on the grant-date fair value. The fair value of each restricted stock award grant is based on the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the grant date.  
  Total stock-based compensation recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses during the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   and the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015   was   $5.0 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively. Total stock-based compensation recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses during the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   and the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015   was   $17.4 million   and   $24.7 million  , respectively. Upon adoption of the Company's retirement policy during the first quarter of fiscal 2015,   $3.8 million   of compensation expense was recognized related to employees whose equity based long-term incentive awards are subject to certain accelerated vesting provisions, based on age and years of service. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , the unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of our stock options was   $0.3 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   0.4 years  , and the unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted shares was   $26.7 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.8 years  . The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015   was   $1.4 million  . The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   was   $0.1 million   and   $6.3 million  , respectively. 
   
                 4. 
    Computation of Net Income per Common Share 

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Under the treasury stock method, potentially dilutive securities include stock options and unvested restricted stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computations of diluted earnings per share if their effect would be antidilutive. 
  A reconciliation of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share is as follows:

    Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments 

Recurring Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value accounting guidance applies to our foreign currency contracts, which include forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross-currency swaps, our Company-owned life insurance policies with a cash surrender value, contingent consideration payable associated with acquisitions, and certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. 
  Fair value accounting guidance requires disclosures that categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for similar or identical instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting our assumptions about pricing by market participants. 
  We classify our foreign currency contracts, Company-owned life insurance policies with cash surrender values and certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as their fair values are derived using quotes provided by major market news services, such as Bloomberg, and industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures, all of which are observable in active markets. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted to reflect credit considerations, generally based on available market evidence. 
  In connection with our acquisition of certain assets from Cellular World and Red Skye Wireless, we recognized an acquisition-date liability of   $43.2 million   representing the total estimated fair value of the contingent consideration (see Note 2, Acquisitions). The fair value was estimated based on Level 3 inputs which include future sales projections derived from our historical experience with comparable acquired stores and a discount rate commensurate with the risks and inherent uncertainty in the business. There was no change in the fair value of the contingent consideration from the date of acquisition through October 29, 2016. 
  The following table provides the fair value of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and recorded in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets (in millions):

  (2) Recognized in accrued liabilities in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
           (3) 
    Current portion of   $20 million   recognized in accrued liabilities and noncurrent portion of   $23.2 million   recognized in other long-term liabilities in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
     We use forward exchange contracts, foreign currency options and cross-currency swaps (together, the  foreign currency contracts ) to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. The foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re-measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities. The total gross notional value of derivatives related to our foreign currency contracts was   $986.3 million  ,   $1,099.8 million   and   $925.3 million   as of   October 29, 2016  ,   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  , respectively.

Activity related to derivative instruments and the offsetting impact of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities recognized in selling, general and administrative expense is as follows (in millions): 

We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative financial instruments and cash equivalent investments. We manage counterparty risk according to the guidelines and controls established under our comprehensive risk management and investment policies. We continuously monitor our counterparty credit risk and utilize a number of different counterparties to minimize our exposure to potential defaults. We do not require collateral under derivative or investment agreements. 
  Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, we record certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required by GAAP. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. We did not record any significant impairment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   or   October 31, 2015  .  
  Other Fair Value Disclosures 
  The carrying values of our cash equivalents, receivables, net and accounts payable approximate the fair value due to their short-term maturities. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , our senior notes due in 2019 had a net carrying value of   $346.3 million   and a fair value of   $361.2 million  , and our senior notes due in 2021 had a net carrying value of   $468.0 million   and a fair value of   $491.7 million  . The fair values of our senior notes were determined based on quoted market prices obtained through an external pricing source which derives its price valuations from daily marketplace transactions, with adjustments to reflect the spreads of benchmark bonds, credit risk and certain other variables. We have determined these to be Level 2 measurements as all significant inputs into the quotes provided by our external pricing source are observable in active markets.   

2019 Senior Notes.    In   September 2014  , we issued   $350.0 million   aggregate principal amount of unsecured   5.50%   senior notes due   October 1, 2019   (the "2019 Senior Notes"). The 2019 Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.50% per annum with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning on April 1, 2015. The 2019 Senior Notes were sold in a private placement and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The 2019 Senior Notes were offered in the U.S. to  qualified institutional buyers  pursuant to the exemption from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and in exempted offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The outstanding principal balance of the 2019 Senior Notes at   October 29, 2016   was   $350.0 million  .    
  2021 Senior Notes.   In   March 2016  , we issued   $475.0 million   aggregate principal amount of unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021 (the "2021 Senior Notes"). The 2021 Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of   6.75%   per annum with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning on September 15, 2016. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. The 2021 Senior Notes were sold in a private placement and will not be registered under the Securities Act. The 2021 Senior Notes were offered in the U.S. to "qualified institutional buyers" pursuant to the exemption from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and in exempted offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The outstanding principal balance of the 2021 Senior Notes at   October 29, 2016   was   $475.0 million  .

The indentures governing the 2019 Senior Notes and the 2021 Senior Notes (together, the "Senior Notes") do not contain financial covenants but do contain covenants which place certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, stock repurchases, the incurrence of additional debt and the repurchase of debt that is junior to the Senior Notes. In addition, the indentures restrict payments of dividends to stockholders (other than dividends payable in shares of capital stock) if one of the following conditions exist: (i) an event of default has occurred, (ii) we could not incur additional debt under the general debt covenant of the indentures or (iii) the sum of the proposed dividend and all other dividends and other restricted payments made under the indentures from the date of the indentures governing the Senior Notes exceeds the sum of   50%   of consolidated net income plus   100%   of net proceeds from capital stock sales and other amounts set forth in and determined as provided in the indentures. These restrictions are subject to exceptions and qualifications, including that we can pay up to   $175 million   in dividends to stockholders in each fiscal year and we can pay dividends and make other restricted payments in an unlimited amount if our leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the dividend payment and other restricted payments would be less than or equal to   1.0  :1.0. 
  The indentures contain customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants, failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, may be declared immediately due and payable. These amounts automatically become due and payable if an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs. 
  The carrying value of our long-term debt is comprised as follows (in millions): 

(1) 
    Includes the reclassification of debt financing costs from "Prepaids and other current assets" and  Other noncurrent assets  as a result of the Company adopting ASU 2015-03. See Note 1. 
     Revolving Credit Facility.    In January 2011, we entered into a   $400 million   credit agreement, which we amended and restated on   March 25, 2014   and further amended on September 15, 2014 (the  Revolver ). The Revolver is a   five  -year, asset-based facility that is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries. Availability under the Revolver is subject to a monthly borrowing base calculation. The Revolver includes a   $50 million   letter of credit sublimit. The amendments extended the maturity date to   March 25, 2019  ; increased the expansion feature under the Revolver from   $150 million   to   $200 million  , subject to certain conditions; and revised certain other terms, including a reduction of the fee we are required to pay on the unused portion of the total commitment amount. 
  Borrowing availability under the Revolver is limited to a borrowing base which allows us to borrow up to   90%   of the appraisal value of the inventory, in each case plus   90%   of eligible credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. The borrowing base provides for borrowing of up to   92.5%   of the appraisal value during the fiscal months of August through October. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow under the Revolver by an amount equal to the face value of the letters of credit. Our ability to pay cash dividends, redeem options and repurchase shares is generally permitted, except under certain circumstances, including if either (1) excess availability under the Revolver is less than   30%  , or is projected to be within 12 months after such payment or (2) excess availability under the Revolver is less than   15%  , or is projected to be within 12 months after such payment, and the fixed charge coverage ratio, as calculated on a pro-forma basis for the prior 12 months, is   1.1  :1.0 or less. In the event that excess availability under the Revolver is at any time less than the greater of (1)   $30 million   or (2)   10%   of the lesser of the total commitment or the borrowing base, we will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of   1.0  :1.0. 
  The Revolver places certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, loans, guarantees, acquisitions and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Absent consent from our lenders, we may not incur more than   $1 billion   of senior secured debt and   $750 million   of additional unsecured indebtedness to be limited to   $250 million   in general unsecured obligations and   $500 million   in unsecured obligations to finance acquisitions valued at   $500 million   or more.

The per annum interest rate under the Revolver is variable and is calculated by applying a margin (1) for prime rate loans of   0.25%   to   0.75%   above the highest of (a) the prime rate of the administrative agent, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.50%   or (c) the London Interbank Offered ( LIBO ) rate for a 30-day interest period as determined on such day plus   1.00%  , and (2) for LIBO rate loans of   1.25%   to   1.75%   above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is determined quarterly as a function of our average daily excess availability under the facility. In addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee of   0.25%   for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. As of   October 29, 2016  , the applicable margin was   0.25%   for prime rate loans and   1.25%   for LIBO rate loans.  
  The Revolver provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any material representation or warranty made by us or the borrowers proving to be false in any material respect, certain bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership events affecting us or our subsidiaries, defaults relating to certain other indebtedness, imposition of certain judgments and mergers or the liquidation of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries. During the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , we cumulatively borrowed   $510.0 million   and repaid   $510.0 million   under the Revolver. Average borrowings under the Revolver for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   were   $56.5 million   and our average interest rate on those borrowings was   2.4%  . As of   October 29, 2016  , total availability under the Revolver was   $391.5 million  , with   no   outstanding borrowings and outstanding standby letters of credit of   $8.5 million  . 
  In September 2007, our Luxembourg subsidiary entered into a discretionary   $20 million   Uncommitted Line of Credit (the  Line of Credit ) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit is available to our foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short-term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of   October 29, 2016  , there were   no   cash overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaled   $2.0 million  . 
   
                 7. 
    Commitments and Contingencies 

In the ordinary course of business, we are, from time to time, subject to various legal proceedings, including matters involving wage and hour employee class actions, stockholder actions and consumer class actions. We may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other types of lawsuits, and may enter into settlement agreements, if we believe settlement is in the best interest of our stockholders. We do not believe that any such existing legal proceedings or settlements, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
  Certain of our French subsidiaries have been under audit by the French Tax Administration (the "FTA") for fiscal years 2008 through 2012.  We received tax reassessment notices on December 23, 2015 and April 4, 2016, pursuant to which the FTA asserted that the French subsidiaries were ineligible to claim certain tax deductions from November 4, 2008, through January 31, 2013, resulting in a potential additional tax charge of approximately    85.5 million  .  We may receive additional tax reassessments in material amounts for subsequent fiscal years. We filed a response to each reassessment and intend to vigorously contest the reassessments through administrative procedures. If we are unable to resolve this matter through administrative remedies at the FTA, we plan to pursue judicial remedies. We believe our tax positions will be sustained and have not taken a reserve for any potential adjustment based on the reassessment.  If we were not to prevail, then the adjustment to our income tax provision could be material.

    Significant Products 

The tables below set forth net sales, percentages of total net sales, gross profit and gross profit percentages by significant product category for the periods indicated (dollars in millions). We have revised the classification of sales and gross profit of our mobile and consumer electronics in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended October 29, 2016 ("Report"). Prior to this Report, we presented a product category labeled "Mobile and consumer electronics" which was comprised of mobile and consumer electronics sold through our Video Game Brands segments and Technology Brands segment. In this Report, sales and gross profit of mobile and consumer electronics generated by our Technology Brands segment are separately presented as "Technology Brands" and sales and gross profit of mobile and consumer electronics generated by our Video Game Brands segments are included in "Other." We believe this presentation is more meaningful to our investors as gross margins of mobile and consumer electronics in our Technology Brands segment differ from our Video Game Brands segments. Sales and gross profit data for prior periods have been recast to the current period presentation.

Statements regarding future economic performance, management s plans and objectives, and any statements concerning assumptions related to the foregoing contained in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations constitute forward-looking statements. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 29, 2016 (the  2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K ), including the factors disclosed under  Item 1A. Risk Factors,  as well as  Disclosure Regarding Forward-looking Statements  and  Item 1A. Risk Factors  below, for certain factors which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward-looking statements. 
  General 
  GameStop Corp. ( GameStop,   we,   us,   our,  or the  Company ) is a global family of specialty retail brands that makes the most popular technologies affordable and simple. Within our family of brands, we are the world s largest omnichannel video game retailer, the largest AT T  ( AT T ) authorized retailer, the largest Apple  ( Apple ) certified products reseller, a Cricket Wireless TM retailer ( Cricket,  an AT T brand) and the owner of   www.thinkgeek.com  , one of the world s largest sellers of collectible pop-culture themed products. We also operate   www.kongregate.com  , a leading browser-based game site, and   Game Informer   magazine, the world's leading print and digital video game publication. We operate our business in four Video Game Brands segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe; and a Technology Brands segment. As of   October 29, 2016  , we operated   7,586   stores, in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe, which are primarily located in major shopping malls and strip centers. 
  Through our Video Game Brands segments, we are the world's largest omnichannel video game retailer. We sell new and pre-owned video game hardware, physical and digital video game software and video game accessories, as well as new and pre-owned mobile and consumer electronics products and other merchandise primarily through our GameStop, EB Games and Micromania stores and our nine global e-commerce sites,   www.gamestop.com  ,   www.ebgames.com.au  ,   www.ebgames.co.nz  ,   www.gamestop.ca  ,   www.gamestop.it  ,   www.gamestop.ie  ,   www.gamestop.de  ,   www.gamestop.co.uk   and   www.micromania.fr  . In July 2015, we acquired Geeknet, Inc. ("Geeknet"), an online and wholesale retailer that sells collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers under the name ThinkGeek through the   www.thinkgeek.com   website. ThinkGeek also sells certain exclusive products to wholesale channel customers.  
  Our Technology Brands segment owns and operates Spring Mobile, the largest authorized retailer of AT T branded wireless retail stores and pre-paid wireless stores under the name Cricket in the United States, as well as a certified reseller of Apple consumer electronic products in the United States under the name Simply Mac. Spring Mobile sells all of AT T s products and services, including DirecTV, through all of its   1,429   AT T branded stores and offers pre-paid wireless services, devices and related accessories through its   70   Cricket branded stores in select markets in the United States. Simply Mac operates   70   stores, selling the full line of Apple products, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones, and offering Apple certified warranty and repair services.  
  Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. The fiscal year ending   January 28, 2017   ("fiscal 2016") and the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016   ("fiscal 2015") each consists of   52   weeks.  
  Growth in the video game industry is generally driven by the introduction of new technology. Gaming consoles are typically launched in cycles as technological developments provide significant improvements in graphics, audio quality, game play, internet connectivity and other entertainment capabilities beyond video gaming. The current generation of consoles (the Sony PlayStation 4, the Microsoft Xbox One and the Nintendo Wii U) was introduced in 2012 and 2013. In August and November 2016, Microsoft and Sony released refreshes to the current generation of consoles. Additionally, in October 2016, Sony introduced its virtual reality hardware, PlayStation VR.  
  We expect that future growth in the video game industry will also be driven by the sale of video games delivered in digital form and the expansion of other forms of gaming. We currently sell various types of products that relate to the digital category, including digitally downloadable content ( DLC ), full game downloads, Xbox LIVE, PlayStation Plus and Nintendo network points cards, as well as prepaid digital and prepaid subscription cards. We have made significant investments in e-commerce and in-store and website functionality to enable our customers to access digital content easily and facilitate the digital sales and delivery process. We plan to continue to invest in these types of processes and channels to grow our digital sales base and enhance our market leadership position in the video game industry and in the digital aggregation and distribution category.

We continue to diversify our business by seeking out opportunities to extend our core competencies to other businesses and retail categories, including mobile and consumer electronics and collectibles, to continue to grow and to help mitigate the financial impact from the cyclical nature of the video game console cycle and regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities.  On May 31, 2016, Spring Mobile completed the acquisition of the assets of an AT T authorized retailer comprised of 71 stores. On August 2, 2016, Spring Mobile completed the acquisition of the assets of two additional AT T authorized retailers comprised of 436 stores. We continue to seek to invest in other retail concepts and product lines with the intention of further diversifying our business. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and do not include all disclosures required under GAAP for complete financial statements.

For a summary of significant accounting policies and the means by which we develop estimates thereon, see  Part II - Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Net Sales 
  Net sales decreased   $57.1 million  , or   2.8%  , for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in comparable store sales of   6.5%   compared to the prior year period. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of video game hardware and software. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales in Technology Brands, collectibles and video game accessories. The increase in sales in Technology Brands and collectibles are a result of the Company's diversification strategy. 
  The decrease in net sales was due to the following: 
             
    New video game hardware sales decreased   $73.7 million  , or   20.6%  , for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , primarily due to a decline in the quantity of hardware units sold combined with a reduction in selling price of certain models as the console cycle matures. 
                 
    Pre-owned and value video game product sales decreased   $32.2 million  , or   6.4%  , for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , primarily due to the decrease in store traffic as a result of weaker new release titles and hardware unit sales declines in the current year quarter. 
      The decreases described above were partially offset by the following: 
              
    Collectibles sales increased   $29.7 million  , or   37.3%  , for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , due to the growth of collectibles sales in our Video Game Brands stores and the growth in the number of stand-alone collectibles stores. 
       Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales decreased   $109.7 million  , or   8.1%  , for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , primarily as a result of the decrease in net sales discussed above and the changes in gross profit discussed below. 
  Gross Profit 
  Gross profit increased $  52.6 million  , or   8.0%  , for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , and gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to   36.1%   in the current quarter compared to   32.5%   in the prior year quarter. The increase in gross profit was driven by increases of   $73.8 million   in Technology Brands primarily related to the growth through acquisitions and new store openings, and   $9.6 million   in collectibles. These increases were partially offset by decreases in new video game software of   $15.8 million   and pre-owned and value video game products of   $13.2 million  . 
  The net increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to product mix shift between categories as sales in our Technology Brands and collectibles categories continue to grow and the following product margin rate variances: 
             
    Gross profit as a percentage of sales in Technology Brands increased to   73.8%   in the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   from   61.2%   in the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , due to the growth in the number of Spring Mobile stores which carry higher margins than the other businesses inside Technology Brands.

The increase described above was offset by the following: 
             
    Gross profit as a percentage of sales on video game accessories decreased to   31.8%   in the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   from   36.5%   in the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , due to the introduction of the PlayStation VR in the current quarter, which carries a lower gross margin than other accessory products.  
      Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") increased   $41.6 million  , or   7.9%  , for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to the growth of the Technology Brands segment, which has higher SG A as a percentage of sales than the other segments. Technology Brands SG A increased $52.8 million in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter, due to an additional 735 Technology Brands stores added since the prior year quarter. The increase was partially offset by lower SG A in our Video Game Brands segments, mainly driven by decreases in store payroll and corporate overhead costs. SG A included   $5.0 million   and   $6.8 million   of stock-based compensation for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $2.9 million  , or   7.4%  , for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to the acquisition and opening of stores in our Technology Brands segment. 
  Interest Expense, Net 
  Interest expense, net increased   $8.3 million   for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015   due to the issuance of the $475.0 million unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021 in March 2016, which is further discussed in Note 6, Debt, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense was   $33.2 million  , representing an effective tax rate of   39.5%  , for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $28.3 million  , representing an effective tax rate of   33.6%  , for the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily related to our profitability level, the relative mix of earnings across the jurisdictions within which we operate and adjustments related to the finalization of tax positions. The Company monitors continual developments in global tax rules, regulations and judicial proceedings. As a result of its ongoing assessments, it is possible the Company could recognize previously unrecognized tax attributes in future periods. 
  Operating Earnings and Net Income 
  The factors described above led to operating earnings of   $98.8 million   for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , or an   8.9%   increase from operating earnings of   $90.7 million   for the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . Net income was   $50.8 million   for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , which represented a   9.1%   decrease from net income of   $55.9 million   for the   13 weeks ended October 31, 2015  .

Net Sales 
  Net sales decreased   $276.3 million  , or   4.7%  , for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in comparable store sales of   7.6%   compared to the prior year period due to a decrease in sales of video game hardware and software. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales in Technology Brands, collectibles and video game accessories. The increase in sales in Technology Brands and collectibles are a result of the Company's diversification strategy. 
  The decrease in net sales was due to the following: 
             
    New video game hardware sales decreased   $309.0 million  , or   27.5%  , for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , primarily due to a decline in the quantity of hardware units sold combined with a reduction in selling price of certain models as the console cycle matures. 
                 
    Pre-owned and value video game product sales decreased   $71.9 million  , or   4.4%  , for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , primarily due to the decrease in store traffic as a result of weaker new release titles and hardware unit sales declines in the current year period. 
      The decreases described above were partially offset by the following: 
     Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales decreased   $402.6 million  , or   10.2%  , for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , primarily as a result of the change in net sales discussed above as well as the changes in gross profit discussed below. 
  Gross Profit 
  Gross profit increased   $126.3 million  , or   6.7%  , for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , and gross profit as a percentage of net sales was   36.0%   in the current year compared to   32.1%   in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was driven by increases of   $184.2 million   in Technology Brands primarily related to the growth through acquisitions and new store openings, and   $46.9 million   in collectibles. These increases were partially offset by decreases in pre-owned and value video game products of   $49.8 million  , new video game software of   $39.3 million  , and new video game hardware of   $13.6 million  . 
  The net increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due to product mix shift between categories as our mobile and consumer electronics and collectibles categories continue to grow and the following product margin rate variances: 
             
    Gross profit as a percentage of sales in Technology Brands increased to   68.1%   in the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   from   55.0%   in the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , due to the growth in the number of Spring Mobile stores which carry higher margins than the other businesses inside Technology Brands.

The increases described above were partially offset by the following: 
              
    Gross profit as a percentage of sales on pre-owned and value video game products decreased to   46.1%   in the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   from   47.1%   in the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , due to a greater mix of sales of current generation products, which carry lower gross margin than previous generation products. 
     Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  SG A increased   $110.7 million  , or   7.4%  , for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to the growth of the Technology Brands segment, which has higher SG A as a percentage of sales than the other segments. Technology Brands SG A increased $126.5 million in the current year period compared to the prior year period, as a result of the 735 stores added since the prior year period. The increase was partially offset by costs incurred in the prior year period associated with our July 2015 acquisition of ThinkGeek and lower stock-based compensation expense compared to the prior year period. SG A included   $17.4 million   and   $24.7 million   in stock-based compensation expense for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $10.8 million  , or   9.5%  , for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to the acquisition and opening of stores in our Technology Brands segments. 
  Interest Expense, Net 
  Interest expense, net increased   $21.7 million   for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compared to the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015   due to the $475.0 million issuance of unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021 in March 2016, which is further discussed in Note 6, Debt, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  Income tax expense was   $87.4 million  , representing an effective tax rate of   37.7%  , for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , compared to   $93.8 million  , representing an effective tax rate of   37.7%  , for the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . The Company monitors continual developments in global tax rules, regulations and judicial proceedings. As a result of its ongoing assessments, it is possible the Company could recognize previously unrecognized tax attributes in future periods. 
  Operating Earnings and Net Income 
  The factors described above led to operating earnings of   $271.1 million   for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , or a   1.8%   increase from operating earnings of   $266.3 million   for the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . Net income was   $144.5 million   for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , which represented a   6.8%   decrease from net income of   $155.0 million   for the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  .  
   
   Segment Performance 
  We report our business in the following segments: Video Game Brands, which consists of four segments in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, and Technology Brands. We identified these segments based on a combination of geographic areas, the methods with which we analyze performance, the way in which our sales and profits are derived and how we divide management responsibility. Our sales and profits are driven through our physical stores which are highly integrated with our e-commerce, digital and mobile businesses. Due to this integration, our physical stores are the basis for our segment reporting. Each of the Video Game Brands segments consists primarily of retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories (which we refer to as video game products), new and pre-owned mobile devices and related accessories. These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products or technologies in the various segments.  
  With our presence in international markets, we have operations in several foreign currencies, including the Euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, Swiss franc, Danish kroner, Swedish krona, and the Norwegian kroner.

  (1)  Comparable store sales is a measure commonly used in the retail industry and indicates store performance by measuring the growth in sales for certain stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year. Our comparable store sales are comprised of sales from our Video Game Brands stores operating for at least 12 full months as well as sales related to our websites and sales we earn from sales of pre-owned merchandise to wholesalers or dealers. Comparable store sales for our international operating segments exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The calculation of comparable store sales for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   compares the 13 weeks for the period ended   October 29, 2016   to the most closely comparable weeks for the prior year period. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers  methods. Our Technology Brands stores are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. We do not consider comparable store sales to be a meaningful metric in evaluating the performance of our Technology Brands stores due to the frequently changing nature of revenue streams and commission structures associated with this segment of our business. We believe our calculation of comparable store sales best represents our strategy as an omnichannel retailer who provides its consumers several ways to access its products. 
  Video Game Brands

The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of video game hardware and software. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of collectibles and the PlayStation VR. Operating earnings for the   13 weeks ended October 29, 2016   decreased   $3.5 million   compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily driven by the decrease in net sales, partially offset by improved gross margin due to a shift in the mix of sales to higher margin categories and reductions in SG A expenses.

The decline in comparable store sales was primarily the result of decreases in video game hardware and software sales.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under our $400 million asset-based revolving credit facility together will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, our continued investments in our Technology Brands businesses, digital initiatives, store openings and remodeling activities and corporate capital allocation programs, including acquisitions, share repurchases and the payment of dividends declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next 12 months. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we had total cash on hand of   $356.1 million   and an additional $  391.5 million   of available borrowing capacity under our $400 million credit agreement, which we entered into in January 2011 and amended and restated on March 25, 2014 and further amended on September 15, 2014 (the "Revolver"). On August 2, 2016, in connection with the continued expansion of our Technology Brands segment, we utilized remaining proceeds from our 2021 Senior Notes and a portion of the available capacity under the Revolver to fund the acquisition of certain assets of two authorized AT T retailers comprised of 436 stores; see "  Uses of Capital" for additional information. As we continue to pursue acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions to expand and grow our business, while also enhancing stockholder value through share repurchases and dividend payments, we regularly monitor capital market conditions and may raise additional funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. The amount, nature and timing of any borrowings or sales of debt or equity securities will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions.   
  Cash Flows  
  During the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , cash provided by operations was   $131.6 million  , compared to   $188.1 million   during the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . The decrease in cash provided by operations of   $56.5 million   was primarily due to an increase in cash used in operations for working capital purposes, which increased   $76.1 million   from a use of   $104.2 million   in the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015   to a use of   $180.3 million   in the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  . The increase in cash used in operations for working capital was due primarily to the timing of tax payments and merchandise inventory payments.  
  Cash used in investing activities was   $541.5 million   and   $337.7 million   during the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   and the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  , respectively. The   $203.8 million   increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to acquisition activity in our Technology Brands during the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   as compared to the prior year period. 
  Cash provided by financing activities was   $296.8 million   during the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , compared to cash used in financing activities of   $259.3 million   during the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015  . The   $556.1 million   additional cash provided by financing activities in the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   as compared to the   39 weeks ended October 31, 2015   was primarily due to the net proceeds of $466.9 million related to the $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 6.75% senior notes due March 15, 2021 we issued in March 2016 (the "2021 Senior Notes") and by $107.2 million lower share repurchases compared to the prior year period. 
  Sources of Liquidity  
  We utilize cash generated from operations and have funds available to us under our Revolver to cover seasonal fluctuations in cash flows and to support our various growth initiatives. Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and consist primarily of time deposits with commercial banks. 
  2019 Senior Notes.    In   September 2014  , we issued   $350.0 million   aggregate principal amount of unsecured   5.50%   senior notes due   October 1, 2019   (the "2019 Senior Notes"). The 2019 Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.50% per annum with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning on April 1, 2015. The 2019 Senior Notes were sold in a private placement and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The 2019 Senior Notes were offered in the U.S. to  qualified institutional buyers  pursuant to the exemption from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and in exempted offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The outstanding principal balance of the 2019 Senior Notes at   October 29, 2016   was   $350.0 million  .

2021 Senior Notes.   In   March 2016  , we issued the 2021 Senior Notes which bear interest at the rate of   6.75%   per annum with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning on September 15, 2016. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends. The 2021 Senior Notes were sold in a private placement and will not be registered under the Securities Act. The 2021 Senior Notes were offered in the U.S. to "qualified institutional buyers" pursuant to the exemption from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and in exempted offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The outstanding principal balance of the 2021 Senior Notes at   October 29, 2016   was   $475.0 million  .  
  The indentures governing the 2019 Senior Notes and the 2021 Senior Notes (together, the "Senior Notes") do not contain financial covenants but do contain covenants which place certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, stock repurchases, the incurrence of additional debt and the repurchase of debt that is junior to the Senior Notes. In addition, the indentures restrict payments of dividends to stockholders (other than dividends payable in shares of capital stock) if one of the following conditions exist: (i) an event of default has occurred, (ii) we could not incur additional debt under the general debt covenant of the indentures or (iii) the sum of the proposed dividend and all other dividends and other restricted payments made under the indentures from the date of the indentures governing the Senior Notes exceeds the sum of   50%   of consolidated net income plus   100%   of net proceeds from capital stock sales and other amounts set forth in and determined as provided in the indentures. These restrictions are subject to exceptions and qualifications, including that we can pay up to   $175 million   in dividends to stockholders in each fiscal year and we can pay dividends and make other restricted payments in an unlimited amount if our leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the dividend payment and other restricted payments would be less than or equal to   1.0  :1.0. 
  The indentures contain customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants, failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, may be declared immediately due and payable. These amounts automatically become due and payable if an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occurs. 
  Revolving Credit Facility.   The Revolver is a   five  -year, asset-based facility that is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries. Availability under the Revolver is subject to a monthly borrowing base calculation. The Revolver includes a   $50 million   letter of credit sublimit. The amendments extended the maturity date to   March 25, 2019  ; increased the expansion feature under the Revolver from   $150 million   to   $200 million  , subject to certain conditions; and revised certain other terms, including a reduction of the fee we are required to pay on the unused portion of the total commitment amount. 
  Borrowing availability under the Revolver is limited to a borrowing base which allows us to borrow up to   90%   of the appraisal value of the inventory, in each case plus   90%   of eligible credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. The borrowing base provides for borrowing of up to   92.5%   of the appraisal value during the fiscal months of August through October. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow under the Revolver by an amount equal to the face value of the letters of credit. Our ability to pay cash dividends, redeem options and repurchase shares is generally permitted, except under certain circumstances, including if either 1) excess availability under the Revolver is less than   30%  , or is projected to be within 12 months after such payment or 2) excess availability under the Revolver is less than   15%  , or is projected to be within 12 months after such payment, and the fixed charge coverage ratio, as calculated on a pro-forma basis for the prior 12 months, is   1.1  :1.0 or less. In the event that excess availability under the Revolver is at any time less than the greater of (1)   $30 million   or (2)   10%   of the lesser of the total commitment or the borrowing base, we will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of   1.0  :1.0. 
  The Revolver places certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including limitations on asset sales, additional liens, investments, loans, guarantees, acquisitions and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Absent consent from our lenders, we may not incur more than   $1 billion   of senior secured debt and   $750 million   of additional unsecured indebtedness to be limited to   $250 million   in general unsecured obligations and   $500 million   in unsecured obligations to finance acquisitions valued at   $500 million   or more. 
  The per annum interest rate under the Revolver is variable and is calculated by applying a margin (1) for prime rate loans of   0.25%   to   0.75%   above the highest of (a) the prime rate of the administrative agent, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.50%   or (c) the London Interbank Offered ( LIBO ) rate for a 30-day interest period as determined on such day plus   1.00%  , and (2) for LIBO rate loans of   1.25%   to   1.75%   above the LIBO rate. The applicable margin is determined quarterly as a function of our average daily excess availability under the facility. In addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee of   0.25%   for any unused portion of the total commitment under the Revolver. As of   October 29, 2016  , the applicable margin was   0.25%   for prime rate loans and   1.25%   for LIBO rate loans.

The Revolver provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any material representation or  warranty made by us or the borrowers proving to be false in any material respect, certain bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership events affecting us or our subsidiaries, defaults relating to certain other indebtedness, imposition of certain judgments and mergers or the liquidation of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries. During the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , we cumulatively borrowed   $510.0 million   and repaid   $510.0 million   under the Revolver. Average borrowings under the Revolver for the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016   were   $56.5 million   and our average interest rate on those borrowings was   2.4%  . As of   October 29, 2016  , total availability under the Revolver was   $391.5 million  , with   no   outstanding borrowings and outstanding standby letters of credit of   $8.5 million  . 
  In September 2007, our Luxembourg subsidiary entered into a discretionary   $20 million   Uncommitted Line of Credit (the  Line of Credit ) with Bank of America. There is no term associated with the Line of Credit and Bank of America may withdraw the facility at any time without notice. The Line of Credit is available to our foreign subsidiaries for use primarily as a bank overdraft facility for short-term liquidity needs and for the issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit to support operations. As of   October 29, 2016  , there were   no   cash overdrafts outstanding under the Line of Credit and bank guarantees outstanding totaled   $2.0 million  . 
  We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our indentures governing the Senior Notes and our Revolver. 
  Uses of Capital  
  Our future capital requirements will depend upon the timing and extent of our ongoing investments in our Technology Brands businesses, our other strategic initiatives, and the number of new stores we open and the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year. We opened or acquired a net of 533 Technology Brands stores in the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  . 
  On August 2, 2016, in connection with the continued expansion of our Technology Brands segment, Spring Mobile completed the acquisition of certain assets of two authorized AT T retailers comprised of 436 stores for $393.2 million in cash, which includes working capital adjustments, and future contingent consideration which we estimate will range from $40.0 million to $50.0 million. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with remaining proceeds from our 2021 Senior Notes combined with a draw on our Revolver. The contingent consideration will be paid in two installments. The first installment of $20 million is contingent on the relocation of certain stores and is due the latter of August 2017 or when relocations are completed. The second installment, which we expect to range from $20.0 million to $30.0 million, is contingent on sales performance of certain stores and is due in March 2018. 
  Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are projected to be approximately $140 million to $150 million, to be used primarily to fund continued growth of our Technology Brands businesses, distribution and information systems and other digital initiatives in support of our operations and new store openings and store remodels.  
  On February 23, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our annual cash dividend from $1.44 to $1.48 per share of Class A Common Stock, which represents an increase of 3%. On March 22, June 21 and September 22, 2016, we made quarterly dividend payments of $0.37 per share of Class A Common Stock to stockholders of record on March 8, June 8 and September 9, 2016, respectively. Additionally, on   November 21, 2016  , our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend to our stockholders of   $0.37   per share of Class A Common Stock payable on   December 13, 2016   to stockholders of record at the close of business on   December 1, 2016  . Future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors. 
  In November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing our management to repurchase up to $500 million of our Class A Common Stock, of which $245.3 million remained available under the program as of   January 30, 2016  . During the   39 weeks ended October 29, 2016  , we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at an average price of $26.63 for a total of $36.0 million. Subsequent to October 29, 2016 through November 29, 2016, we repurchased   0.8   million shares of our Class A Common Stock at an average price of $  22.63   for a total of $  17.1   million.

Disclosure Regarding Forward-looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other oral and written statements made by us to the public contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause our actual results, performance, achievements or industry results to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the "Disclosure Regarding Forward-looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" sections in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of these risks and uncertainties. 
  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur, causing actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied by our forward-looking statements. 
   
                 Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

There have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as set forth in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
                 Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) at the reasonable assurance level. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. 
  (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 

In the ordinary course of our business, we are, from time to time, subject to various legal proceedings, including matters involving wage and hour employee class actions and consumer class actions. We may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other types of lawsuits, and may enter into settlement agreements, if we believe settlement is in the best interest of our stockholders. We do not believe that any such existing legal proceedings or settlements, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
  Certain of our French subsidiaries have been under audit by the French Tax Administration (the "FTA") for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. We received tax reassessment notices on December 23, 2015 and April 4, 2016, pursuant to which the FTA asserted that the French subsidiaries were ineligible to claim certain tax deductions from November 4, 2008, through January 31, 2013, resulting in a potential additional tax charge of approximately  85.5 million. We may receive additional tax reassessments in material amounts for subsequent fiscal years. We filed a response to each reassessment and intend to vigorously contest the reassessments through administrative procedures. If we are unable to resolve this matter through administrative remedies at the FTA, we plan to pursue judicial remedies. We believe our tax positions will be sustained and have not taken a reserve for any potential adjustment based on the reassessment. If we were not to prevail, then the adjustment to our income tax provision could be material.
