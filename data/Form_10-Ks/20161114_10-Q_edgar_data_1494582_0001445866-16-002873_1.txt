NOTE 1.      ORGANIZATION AND BACKGROUND  

Boston Omaha Corporation was organized on August 11, 2009 with present management taking over operations in February 2015.  The Company's operations include (i) its outdoor advertising business with multiple billboards across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Wisconsin, (ii) its insurance business that specializes in surety bonds, and (iii) equity method investments in several real estate and real estate service companies.  The Company's billboard operations are conducted through its subsidiary, Link Media Holdings, LLC and its insurance operations are conducted through its subsidiary, General Indemnity Group, LLC.

During the first quarter of 2015, the Company realized revenues from consulting services which were attributable to one client that was related to a former officer and director of the Company.  Beginning with the second quarter of 2015, the Company ceased rendering consulting services.

On December 31, 2015, the Company transferred its interest in Ananda Investments, LLC ("Ananda") to the former controlling stockholder in full satisfaction of its note payable.  On January 22, 2016, in connection with the transfer of its interest in Ananda, the Company was released from its guaranty of Ananda's mortgage payable.  In connection with the sale of its interest in Ananda, the Company's subsidiary Ananda Holdings, LLC ceased operations. During March 2016, the ownership of Ananda Holdings, LLC was transferred to the former controlling stockholder.

The Company completed an acquisition of an outdoor advertising business and entered the outdoor advertising industry on June 19, 2015.  On July 23, 2015, August 31, 2015, February 16, 2016 and June 15, 2016, the Company completed five additional acquisitions.

On April 20, 2016, the Company completed an acquisition of a surety bond business, thus expanding its operations in insurance.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

Reclassifications

Certain accounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform with the presentation in the current-year financial statements.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of advertising agency commissions, sales discounts, and allowances for doubtful accounts.  The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on its knowledge of its customers and historical experience of bad debts.  In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, it records a specific allowance to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected.  For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debt based upon historical experience of bad debts as a percentage of revenue, adjusted for relative improvement or deterioration in its agings and changes in current economic conditions.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $25,177 and $2,111, respectively.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation and amortization are provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from:

Structures

15 years

Digital displays and electrical

3 to 10 years

Static and tri-vision displays

7 to 15 years

Vehicles, equipment, and furniture

2 to 5 years

Maintenance and repair costs are charged against income as incurred.  Significant improvements or betterments are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated life of the asset.

Contracts, forms library, domain names, and proprietary software

2 to 3 years

Intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment.  Management monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate long-lived assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable.  Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded.  The Company recorded no impairment on its long-lived assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue from consulting services when earned, according to the accrual basis of accounting.

The Company generates revenue from outdoor advertising through the leasing of billboards.  The terms of the operating agreements range from less than one month to three years and are generally billed monthly.  Revenue for advertising space rental is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.  Advertising revenue is reported net of agency commissions.  Agency commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue for operations.  Payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue.

Advertising agency commissions for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $50,531 and $3,218, respectively.

The Company generates revenue from commissions on surety bond sales.   The insurance commissions are calculated based upon a stated percentage applied to the gross premiums on bonds.  Payments received for gross premiums are held in escrow until the bond is written.  When the bond is written, funds are disbursed from escrow for the payment of the bond and the commission earned on the bond.

Segment Information

The Company's current operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include the outdoor advertising industry and the insurance industry.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company's operations do not include insurance since the Company's insurance operations began in October 2015.

NOTE 6.      CONVERTIBLE NOTE RECEIVABLE  

On September 13, 2016, the Company purchased an unsecured convertible note receivable from Breezeway Homes, Inc. ("Breezeway") for the principal sum of $100,000.  The note bears interest at three percent (3%) per annum.  Principal and accrued interest are payable on demand at the earlier of December 31, 2018 or the closing of Breezeway's next equity financing.  The conversion provisions will be determined by the amount, date and timing of Breezeway's next equity financing.

NOTE 7.      NOTE PAYABLE, FORMER STOCKHOLDER  

In connection with the former controlling stockholder's sale of his entire interest in the Company, the Company became obligated on a note payable to the former stockholder in the principal amount of $135,494.  The note bore interest at 5.76% per annum, was due February 12, 2016 and was secured by the Company's 40% interest in Ananda Investments, LLC ("Ananda".)  During September 2015, Ananda made a distribution to its members.  The Company's share of the distribution was $32,000 and was distributed directly to the former controlling stockholder instead of to the Company.  In accordance with the terms of the note payable, the distribution made by Ananda to the former controlling stockholder was treated as a reduction of principal, thus reducing the outstanding principal balance to $103,494.

NOTE 8.      NOTES PAYABLE, STOCKHOLDERS  

The notes were payable to the two majority stockholders.  On February 29, 2016, the two controlling stockholders extinguished the notes payable, together with accrued interest on each note of $3,014.  Each note was extinguished in exchange for 5,223 shares of common stock at a price of $10.15 per share.  The conversion of the notes payable was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt.  There was no gain or loss on the conversion since the fair value of the stock issued was equivalent to the fair value of the notes prior to conversion.

NOTE 9.      CAPITAL STOCK  

As discussed in Note 8, the Company issued 5,223 shares of common stock to each of the two controlling stockholders at a price of $10.15 per share in exchange for the extinguishment of notes payable and accrued interest, totaling $106,028.

On March 11, 2016, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to reduce authorized shares of common stock from 18,000,000 to 11,000,000 shares; authorized shares of Class A common stock from 1,300,000 shares to 1,161,116 shares; and, preferred stock from 3,000,000 shares to 1,000,000 shares.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company raised $41,761,319, in cash, from the issuance of its common stock.  The stock was issued at a price of $10.15 per share and represents the issuance of 4,114,415 shares.  Of that amount, the controlling stockholders had purchased, for cash, 2,906,403 shares for a total cash consideration of $29,499,990.  As a group, entities related to the Company's officers and directors purchased 3,001,254 shares for a total cash consideration of $30,462,729.

Overview

Boston Omaha Corporation was originally incorporated as REO Plus, Inc. on August 10, 2009 under the laws of the State of Texas.  On March 18, 2015, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Boston Omaha Corporation.   Our principal address is 292 Newbury Street, Suite 333, Boston, Massachusetts 02115 and our telephone number is 857-256-0079.

We currently operate several lines of business, including outdoor billboards and related advertising services, a surety insurance brokerage firm, and maintain minority ownership positions in several real estate ventures.  Since June 2015, we have acquired six different outdoor billboard businesses located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Wisconsin, which own and operate over 590 billboard signs.  In April 2016, we also completed an acquisition of a surety bond business, thus expanding our operations in insurance. 

Acquisitions  .

In April 2016, we acquired The Warnock Agency, Inc., a broker of surety insurance policies.   On May 19, 2016, General Indemnity Group, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a stock purchase agreement with the shareholders of United Casualty and Surety Insurance Company ("UC S"), pursuant to which General Indemnity Group, LLC will purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of UC S.  The purchase price for the acquired stock will be $13,000,000, to be paid to the selling stockholders at closing.  UC S is an insurance company headquartered in Quincy, Massachusetts, specializing in providing surety bonds.  UC S is authorized to conduct business in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Florida.  The closing of the acquisition is contingent upon certain closing conditions, including the approval by the Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A hearing by the Massachusetts Division of Insurance on our application is currently scheduled to occur on November 15, 2016.  

20 

Our business objective is to grow intrinsic value per share at an attractive rate by retaining capital to reinvest in the productive capabilities of our current subsidiaries, make opportunistic investments, and/or invest in new, other potentially durable earnings streams.  

We were formed by a Delaware corporation then known as Akashic Ventures, Inc. ("Akashic") for purposes of acquiring financially attractive real estate properties.  Until December 31, 2015 we owned a 40% membership interest in Ananda Investments, LLC ("Ananda"), a Texas limited liability company that owns a particular real estate property near and west of downtown Houston, Texas.  On December 31, 2015, we sold this interest to Richard Church, our former principal stockholder, in exchange for cancellation of a promissory note we issued to Mr. Church in the original principal amount of $135,494.   

Financing Activities  :

In January 2016, we commenced an offering of shares of our common stock to accredited investors (the "2016 Financing") at a price of $10.15 per share.  We raised $41,761,319 in gross proceeds, issuing an additional 4,114,415 shares of our Common Stock.  Magnolia and Boulderado acquired approximately 62.3% and 8.4%, respectively, of the Common Stock sold in the 2016 Financing.  In addition, other directors and officers directly or indirectly acquired beneficial ownership of approximately an additional 2.3% of the Common Stock sold in the 2016 financing.

As of September 30, 2016, we had issued and outstanding 5,841,815 shares of Common Stock, 1,055,560 shares of Class A Common Stock and warrants to purchase 105,556 shares of Class A Common Stock.  Assuming all currently exercisable warrants are exercised, Magnolia and Boulderado collectively own approximately 82.6% of our current outstanding shares of common stock on a combined basis.  As each share of Class A Common Stock has 10 votes, Magnolia and Boulderado combined control the voting of 92.6% of all votes held by the holders of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock on a combined basis. 

We became a publicly held corporation in November 2012 when Akashic distributed to certain of its shareholders a total of 132,927 shares of our Common Stock held by it under a registration statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  On November 9, 2016, we registered as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and our Common Stock trades on the OTCQX Exchange under the trading symbol "BOMN." 

Plan of Operation 

Present management took over operations in February 2015.  Since June 2015, we have acquired outdoor billboard assets in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Wisconsin and expect to continue to seek additional acquisitions in billboard advertising.  We have also acquired an insurance brokerage firm specializing in surety insurance and have entered into an agreement to acquire UC S,  an insurance company specializing in providing surety bonds . We believe these businesses offer the potential to provide a durable and growing cash flow stream over time.  In addition, we believe that in the outdoor billboard business, multiple opportunities could exist in time for the industry at large including but not limited to: supply limitations, demand growth, opportunity to convert static billboard faces to digital applications when the economics are favorable, and a growing use of billboard advertising by customers who previously ignored or underutilized the medium due to the general inflexibility of static board contracts.  We source acquisitions both internally via phone calls or mailings and also by receipt of target acquisition opportunities from a number of brokers and other professionals.  

21 

In addition to these completed and pending acquisitions, we are also seeking opportunities to acquire other businesses or a significant interest in existing businesses.  We look to acquire businesses in their entirety that have consistently demonstrated earnings power over time, with attractive pretax historical returns on tangible equity capital, while utilizing minimal to no debt, and that are available at a reasonable price.  However, we may consider minority positions.  In certain circumstances, we may enter lines of business directly when the opportunities and economics of doing so are favorable in comparison to acquisitions. 

From June 19, 2015 through September 30, 2016, we have raised $66,872,500 through the sale of our equity securities, which includes the conversion of $611,181 in principal and interest under certain loans to equity.  We have also extinguished the remaining $135,494 in debt through the exchange of our minority interest in a real estate venture for the cancellation of this debt.  As a result, and after payment for the acquisitions described above, as of September 30, 2016, we had $42,375,758 in unrestricted cash and no debt.  This figure excludes our obligation to pay approximately $13,000,000 to the stockholders of UC S if and when the UC S transaction is consummated.

Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Revenues .  During the third quarter of 2016, we had revenues of $1,042,237 as compared to revenues of $349,161 during the third quarter of 2015.  We realized revenues of $959,148 from billboard rentals during the third quarter of 2016.  We also realized revenues of $83,089 from insurance commissions from our subsidiary, The Warnock Agency, Inc., which we acquired in April 2016.  Revenues increased in our billboard operations to $959,148 during the third quarter of 2016 from $349,161 during the third quarter of 2015 as we significantly increased our billboard operations through several acquisitions.

Quarter over quarter revenue increased 4.8% in the third quarter of 2016 from the second quarter of 2016, with billboard revenues increasing by 19.8% to $959,148 during the third quarter of 2016 from $800,518 during the second quarter of 2016.  This increase was derived primarily from the seasonal increase in revenues from our Wisconsin billboards, which are primarily located in a summer vacation region, increased revenues generally for all of our billboard operations, and to a lesser extent from the purchase of 24 billboards during the second quarter of 2016.  The increase in billboard revenues was partially offset by a reduction in revenue from insurance commissions from $193,761 during the second quarter of 2016 to $83,089 during the third quarter of 2016.   This decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of receipt of certain commissions.

Expenses .  During the third quarter of 2016, we had expenses in the amount of $1,826,761, primarily from the cost of employees, cost of billboard revenues excluding depreciation and amortization expenses, and general and administrative expenses, which combined totaled $1,043,960.  Non-cash expenses included $245,787 in depreciation and $255,295 in amortization expenses associated with our acquisitions in 2015 and 2016 or on a combined basis, 27.4% of costs and expenses during the third quarter of 2016.  We also incurred $281,719 in professional fees, associated primarily with legal and accounting expenses incurred in connection with completing certain audits associated with prior acquisitions, costs associated with our 2016 Financing, as well as our costs incurred in listing on the OTCQX and other costs associated in operating a public company.  During the third quarter of 2015, we had costs and expenses of $799,161, as our billboard operations were more limited in 2015 and we had just begun to incur costs associated with our surety insurance business.

22 

Expenses increased 10.6% in the third quarter of 2016 to $1,826,761 from $1,651,450 during the second quarter of 2016 as a result of increased billboard operations, the additional costs of certain billboards acquired late in the second quarter of 2016, and increased depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the acquisitions we completed.  Compared to the second quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses increased by 7.3% in the third quarter of 2016 and professional fees decreased by 18.8% to $281,719 from $346,975 during the second quarter of 2016 when we completed several acquisitions and negotiated and signed the agreement to acquire all of the shares of UC S.

Net Loss from Operations .   Net loss from operations during the third quarter of 2016 increased 74.3% to $784,524 from a net loss from operations of $450,000 during the third quarter of 2015.   $501,082 of this net loss from operations during the third quarter of 2016 is associated with non-cash amortization and depreciation expenses.  In addition, certain of our professional legal and accounting expenses are one-time expenses associated with acquisitions and financing activities.  At September 30, 2016, we had recorded goodwill at $7,917,853 and intangible assets of $2,887,800, net of amortization compared to recorded goodwill of $7,632,698 and intangible assets of $3,428,250, net of amortization at June 30, 2016.  We expect to continue to incur significant depreciation, and amortization expenses for the foreseeable future as we incur depreciation and amortization charges associated with completed acquisitions, our pending anticipated acquisition of UC S and potential future acquisitions. Net loss from operations during the third quarter of 2016 decreased to 75.3% of revenues from a net loss from operations of 128.8% of revenues during the third quarter of 2015.

Our net loss from operations during the third quarter of 2016 increased to 75.3% of total revenues as compared to a net loss from operations of $657,171 during the second quarter of 2016, or 66.1% of total revenues.  The increase in net loss from operations in the third quarter of 2016 is due primarily to higher operating costs, depreciation and amortization expenses as well as the decrease in revenues realized during the third quarter of 2016 due to the timing of receipt of certain insurance commissions.  Our strategy is to continue to acquire additional billboard businesses and other businesses which offer the potential to provide a durable and growing cash flow stream over time and which we believe will provide the volume of revenues necessary to operate profitably.  

Other Income (Expense).   During the third quarter of 2016, we had a loss of $6,623 in equity from our interests in certain real estate ventures, a decrease from equity income of $4,151 during the third quarter of 2015 from our now discontinued interest in Ananda Holdings.  This also compares to equity income during the second quarter of 2016 of $17,826.  During the third quarter of 2016, we had interest expense in the amount of $182, a decrease from interest expense of $3,442 in the third quarter of 2015.  All of the 2015 interest expense was due to loans issued to Boulderado and Magnolia and a prior loan issued by the Company to Richard Church.  We converted or otherwise extinguished many of our outstanding loans in 2015 and converted the final outstanding loans during the first quarter of 2016.

Net Loss.    We had a net loss before income taxes of $791,329 during the third quarter of 2016, compared to a net loss before income taxes of $449,291 during the third quarter of 2015 and a net loss of $639,661 during the second quarter of 2016, or a per-share loss of $0.11 during each of the third quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2016, a decrease from the net loss per share of $.18 for the third quarter of 2015.  Although the net loss increased between the second and third quarters of 2016, the net loss per share remained the same because the shares sold in the 2016 financing increased the number of weighted average shares outstanding from 5,945,267 at June 30, 2016 to 6,896,923 at September 30, 2016.  Our net loss during the third quarter of 2015 was based on 2,441,536 weighted average shares outstanding.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Revenues .  We realized revenues of $2,550,060 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  $2,273,210 of these revenues were from billboard rentals.  We completed three billboard business acquisitions at various times during this nine month period.  Revenues during the first nine months ended September 30, 2016 also included $276,850 in revenues from The Warnock Agency, Inc. which we acquired during the second quarter of 2016.   During the first nine months of 2015, we had revenues in the amount of $349,161 from billboard revenues as we acquired billboards late in the second quarter and during the third quarter of 2015.  We no longer provide the real estate consulting services from which we derived revenues of $9,700 during the first nine months of 2015.

23 

Expenses .  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had expenses in the amount of $4,785,690, primarily from the cost of employees, cost of billboard revenues excluding depreciation and amortization expenses, and general and administrative expenses, which combined totaled $2,532,068.  Non-cash expenses included $654,125 in depreciation and $596,601 in amortization expenses associated with our acquisitions in 2015 and 2016, or 26% of total costs and expenses.  We also incurred $974,214 in professional fees, associated primarily with legal and accounting expenses associated with a number of acquisitions which occurred in 2016, accounting costs associated with financial reporting obligations for acquisitions completed in 2016, costs associated with the 2016 Financing, costs associated with our listing on the OTCQX and our costs incurred as a public company.  During the first nine months of 2015, we had expenses in the amount of $1,047,760, which expenses were primarily professional fees incurred in connection with several acquisitions and potential acquisitions, financing transactions, our costs of reorganizing as a Delaware corporation and related reorganization activities, and costs incurred as a public company.

Net Loss from Operations .  Net loss from operations was $2,235,630 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses associated with acquisitions accounted for $1,250,726 of the loss.  This compares to net losses from operations in the amount of $688,899 during the first nine months of 2015 when we had limited billboard operations and depreciation and amortization expenses totaling $211,304.

Other Income (Expense) .   During the first nine months of 2016, we had a loss of $32,958 in equity from our interests in certain real estate ventures.  We also incurred interest expense of $2,240.  During the first nine months of 2015, we had equity income from our now discontinued interest in Ananda Holdings, in the amount of $12,565.  During the first nine months of 2015, we had interest expense in the amount of $19,745.  

Net loss .   We had a net loss in the amount of $2,270,828 during the first nine months of 2016, or a per-share loss of $0.40, based on 5,744,898 weighted average shares outstanding.  This compared to a net loss in the amount of $696,079 during the first nine months of 2015, or a per-share loss of $0.67, based on 1,046,178 weighted average shares outstanding.

Liquidity and Capital Requirements

Currently, we own billboards in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Wisconsin, a surety insurance brokerage firm we acquired in April 2016, and have minority investments in several real estate entities.  We also have a pending acquisition of UC S with a purchase price of $13,000,000.  Our strategy is to continue to acquire other billboard locations and insurance businesses as well as acquire other businesses which we would expect to generate positive cash flows.  We currently expect to finance any future acquisition with cash and seller or third party financing.  In the future, we may satisfy a portion of the purchase price for a property with the Company's equity securities.  At September 30, 2016, we had $42,375,758 in unrestricted cash.  As a result, we have adequate resources to complete the UC S acquisition and a certain limited number of potential future acquisitions with these proceeds.  If and when we exhaust the funds from the 2016 Financing, we may choose to raise additional funding to complete potential future acquisitions that are available at a reasonable price.

We continue to explore both the type and scope of acquisitions and business lines that we wish to pursue.  The amount of capital that we will need will depend on the scope of the acquisitions and business lines that we ultimately decide to pursue, which is uncertain at this time.  However, for us to acquire significant additional businesses, we may need to undertake certain financing activities once we exhaust the funding raised in the 2016 Financing.  The sources for financing would initially most likely be institutional investors or accredited individuals although we may also consider raising additional funds through the public markets.  We currently do not have any binding commitments for additional financing.  We cannot assure anyone that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonably terms.  If we do not obtain additional financing, it may limit the acquisitions we can complete.   We cannot assure anyone that we will be successful in obtaining necessary capital in our acquisition activities or that any acquisition will achieve or maintain profitability.

Seasonal Effects and Effects of Inflation

Management believes that its business interests in real estate and outdoor billboard advertising are not subject to significant seasonal variations, although certain of our billboard operations in Wisconsin may realize increased revenues during the summer months due to their locations in regions with a large number of summer visitors.  Management further believes that the service nature of the businesses we operate may not be as impacted by inflation as more capital intensive businesses, since materials are not anticipated to be a significant component of our costs, and we currently possess businesses with relatively minimal capital expenditure needs.  However, management also believes inflation can affect all businesses.  Our labor, electricity usage, insurance, and other costs may be subject to inflationary pressures.  It should also be understood that we own digital billboards within our billboard assets, which must be replaced over time to maintain revenue levels and remain competitive, therefore depreciating faster than static billboards.  Historically, the cost of digital billboard faces has declined while useful lives have increased as the technology advanced, thus proving somewhat deflationary.  There is no guarantee that this will continue though, and the cost of digital billboard faces may increase.  In addition, significant decreases in general economic conditions may reduce outdoor advertising rates and adversely impact the real estate market.  Currently, we do not anticipate raising significant debt financing; therefore, we do not anticipate that operating results will be adversely affected by increased interest rates.  In the future though, we may seek to raise additional capital through debt or convertible debt financings, and in such an event, increased interest rates may increase the cost of any future borrowing.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Not applicable.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management has employed a framework consistent with Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(c), to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting described below. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. 

As defined by Auditing Standard No. 5, "An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of Financial Statements and Related Independence Rule and Conforming Amendments," established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

25 

Our management believes that the lack of a formal risk assessment process and monitoring structure raises a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements may not be timely prevented or detected and should therefore be considered a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.  Because of this material weakness, our management believes that as of September 30, 2016, our company's internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective.  

Despite our current view that internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, we have taken a number of steps to address this potential area of risk.  In June 2016, we hired a full-time controller.  The controller is working on a risk assessment, currently analyzing existing internal controls and coordinating our efforts to remediate any potential deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting.  In addition, earlier this year, we appointed our first independent member of our board of directors and we recently added Robert Slezak as an additional independent director.  Mr. Slezak has significant financial experience as the chief financial officer of the company now known as TD Ameritrade, having served as its chief financial officer before it became a public company and for a period when it was a public company.  Notwithstanding the assessment that our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, based on our recent actions and the post-closing procedures performed, we believe that our financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods covered thereby in all material respects.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures  

Our management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

Other than as disclosed above, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the period of this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 The Company's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company and have: 

(a)     Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

(b)      Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

5. 
 The Company's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company's Board of Directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

(b)     Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
