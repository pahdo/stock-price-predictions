  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  Amounts are in millions unless indicated otherwise (per share data assume dilution). 
   
           Note 1. 
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton or the Company) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) for complete financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) have been made that are necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods. 
  This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Eaton s   2015   Form 10-K. The interim period results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date this Form 10-Q was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  During the first quarter of   2016  , the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than an asset. The Company has applied this standard retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the reclassification of   $36   and   $35   within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, from Other noncurrent assets to a reduction in Long-term debt. 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), (ASU 2016-02). This accounting standard requires that a lessee recognize a lease asset and a lease liability on its balance sheet for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 will require additional disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Eaton is evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 and an estimate of the impact to the consolidated financial statements cannot be made at this time. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). This accounting standard supersedes all existing US GAAP revenue recognition guidance. Under ASU 2014-09, a company will recognize revenue when it transfers the control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to collect in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will require additional disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date (ASU 2015-14). This accounting standard defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and permits early adoption as of the original effective date. Eaton is evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 and an estimate of the impact to the consolidated financial statements cannot be made at this time.

Note 6.    DEBT 
  On September 20, 2016, a subsidiary of Eaton issued Euro denominated notes (Euro Notes) with a face value of    550   (  $615   based on the September 20, 2016 spot rate), in accordance with Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Euro Notes mature in 2024 with interest payable annually at a rate of   0.75%  . The issuer received proceeds totaling    544   (  $609   based on the September 20, 2016 spot rate) from the issuance, net of financing costs and discounts. The senior Euro Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Euro Notes contain an optional redemption provision by which the Company may make an offer to purchase all or any part of the Euro Notes prior to June 20, 2024 at a purchase price of the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the respective Euro Notes being redeemed, or (b) the sum of the present values of the respective remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis at the benchmark Bund Rate plus 20 basis points. In each case, the redemption price will include any accrued and unpaid interest on the Euro Notes being redeemed. At any time on or after June 20, 2024, the Company may redeem the Euro Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Euro Notes also contain a change of control provision which requires the Company to make an offer to purchase all or any part of the Euro Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The capitalized deferred financing fees and discounts are amortized in Interest expense - net over the respective terms of the Euro Notes. The Euro Notes are subject to customary non-financial covenants. 
  On October 14, 2016, Eaton refinanced a   $750  , five-year revolving credit facility with a   $750  , five-year revolving credit facility that will expire October 14, 2021. Eaton also maintains a   $500  , four-year revolving credit facility that will expire on October 3, 2018 and a   $750  , five-year credit facility that will expire October 3, 2019. This refinancing maintains long-term revolving credit facilities at a total of   $2,000  . The revolving credit facilities are used to support commercial paper borrowings and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis. There were no borrowings outstanding under these revolving credit facilities at   September 30, 2016   or October 14, 2016.

Note 8. 
    LEGAL CONTINGENCIES 
     Eaton is subject to a broad range of claims, administrative and legal proceedings such as lawsuits that relate to contractual allegations, tax audits, patent infringement, personal injuries, antitrust matters and employment-related matters. Eaton is also subject to asbestos claims from historic products which may have contained asbestos. Insurance may cover some of the costs associated with these claims. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome or cost of these matters, the Company believes they will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
  In December 2010, a Brazilian court held that a judgment obtained by a Brazilian company, Raysul, against another Brazilian company, Saturnia, which was sold by Eaton in   2006  , could be enforced against Eaton Ltda. The judgment was based on an alleged violation of an agency agreement between Raysul and Saturnia. At March 31, 2016, the Company had a total accrual of   100   Brazilian Reais related to this matter (  $31   based on June 2016 exchange rates). In June 2016, Eaton signed a settlement agreement and resolved the matter, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

Note 9. 
    INCOME TAXES  
     The effective income tax rate for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016   was expense of   9%  , and   10%  , respectively, compared to an expense of   9%   for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  . The increase in the effective tax rate in the first   nine   months of   2016   was primarily due to more income earned in higher tax jurisdictions. 

On October 22, 2013, Eaton's Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program (2013 Program) that authorizes the repurchase of   40 million   ordinary shares. During the first quarter of   2016  ,   1.5 million   ordinary shares were repurchased under the 2013 Program in the open market at a total cost of   $82  . During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   4.8 million   and   7.2 million   ordinary shares were repurchased under the 2013 Program in the open market at a total cost of   $284   and   $454  , respectively. On February 24, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for share repurchases up to   $2,500   of ordinary shares (2016 Program). Under the 2016 Program, the ordinary shares are expected to be repurchased over time, depending on market conditions, the market price of ordinary shares, capital levels, and other considerations. During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   3.7 million   and   7.7 million   ordinary shares, respectively, were purchased on the open market under the 2016 Program for a total cost of   $243   and   $485  , respectively.

  Net Income Per Share Attributable to Eaton Ordinary Shareholders 
  A summary of the calculation of net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders follows: 

For the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016  ,   1.5 million   and   1.8 million   stock options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders because the exercise price of the options exceeded the average market price of the ordinary shares during the period and their effect, accordingly, would have been antidilutive. For the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2015  ,   1.8 million   and   1.3 million   stock options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders because the exercise price of the options exceeded the average market price of the ordinary shares during the periods and their effect, accordingly, would have been antidilutive.  

Note 11. 
    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
     Fair value is measured based on an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to satisfy a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a fair value hierarchy is established, which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
  
    11 

     Table of Contents   

A summary of financial instruments recognized at fair value, and the fair value measurements used, follows: 

Eaton values its financial instruments using an industry standard market approach, in which prices and other relevant information is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. No financial instruments were measured using unobservable inputs. 
  Other Fair Value Measurements 
  Long-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt had a carrying value of   $8,431   and fair value of   $9,050   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $7,988   and   $8,231  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . The fair value of Eaton's debt instruments were estimated using prevailing market interest rates on debt with similar creditworthiness, terms and maturities, and are considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. 

Note 12. 
    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
     In the normal course of business, Eaton is exposed to certain risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company uses various derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, currency forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and, to a lesser extent, commodity contracts, to manage risks from these market fluctuations. The instruments used by Eaton are straightforward, non-leveraged instruments. The counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings. Eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions. Such instruments are not purchased and sold for trading purposes. 
  Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated, and is effective, as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, as to the nature of the hedging activity. Eaton formally documents all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges and the hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative financial instruments to a recognized asset or liability, specific firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or net investment in a foreign operation. These financial instruments can be designated as: 
             
    Hedges of the change in the fair value of a recognized fixed-rate asset or liability, or the firm commitment to acquire such an asset or liability (a fair value hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in income during the period of change in fair value. 
                
    Hedges of the variable cash flows of a recognized variable-rate asset or liability, or the forecasted acquisition of such an asset or liability (a cash flow hedge); for these hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss on the hedged item is included in income. 
                
    Hedges of the currency exposure related to a net investment in a foreign operation (a net investment hedge); for these hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss related to the net investment in the foreign operation is included in income. 
     
    12 

     Table of Contents   

The gain or loss from a derivative financial instrument designated as a hedge that is effective is classified in the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Income as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. The change in fair value of a derivative financial instrument that is not effective as a hedge is immediately recognized in income. 
  For derivatives that are not designated as a hedge, any gain or loss is immediately recognized in income. The majority of derivatives used in this manner relate to risks resulting from assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and certain commodity contracts that arise in the normal course of business. Gains and losses associated with commodity hedge contracts are classified in Cost of products sold. 
  Eaton uses certain of its debt denominated in foreign currency to hedge portions of its net investments in foreign operations against foreign currency exposure (net investment hedges). Foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative net investment hedging instruments on an after-tax basis was   $99   at   September 30, 2016   and   $83   at   December 31, 2015  , and designated on a pre-tax basis was   $607   at   September 30, 2016  .  
  Derivative Financial Statement Impacts 
  The fair value of derivative financial instruments recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets follows: 

The currency exchange contracts shown in the table above as derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily contracts entered into to manage currency volatility or exposure on intercompany sales and loans. While Eaton does not elect hedge accounting treatment for these derivatives, Eaton targets managing   100%   of the intercompany balance sheet exposure to minimize the effect of currency volatility related to the movement of goods and services in the normal course of its operations. This activity represents the great majority of these currency exchange contracts.

    CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     On November 14, 2013, Eaton Corporation registered senior notes under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Senior Notes). Eaton and certain other of Eaton's   100%   owned direct and indirect subsidiaries (the Guarantors) fully and unconditionally guaranteed (subject, in the case of the Guarantors, other than Eaton, to customary release provisions as described below), on a joint and several basis, the Senior Notes. The following condensed consolidating financial statements are included so that separate financial statements of Eaton, Eaton Corporation and each of the Guarantors are not required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The consolidating adjustments primarily relate to eliminations of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions. The condensed consolidating financial statements present investments in subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting. 
  The guarantee of a Guarantor that is not a parent of the issuer will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged in the event of any sale of the Guarantor or of all or substantially all of its assets, or in connection with the release or termination of the Guarantor as a guarantor under all other U.S. debt securities or U.S. syndicated credit facilities, subject to limitations set forth in the indenture. The guarantee of a Guarantor that is a direct or indirect parent of the issuer will only be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged in connection with the release or termination of such Guarantor as a guarantor under all other debt securities or syndicated credit facilities (in both cases, U.S. or otherwise), subject to limitations set forth in the indenture.  
  During 2015 and 2016, the Company undertook certain steps to restructure ownership of various subsidiaries. The transactions were entirely among wholly-owned subsidiaries under the common control of Eaton. This restructuring has been reflected as of the beginning of the earliest period presented below.

ITEM 2.   
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
     Amounts are in millions of dollars or shares unless indicated otherwise (per share data assume dilution). 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 
  Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton or the Company) is a power management company with   2015   net sales of $20.9 billion. The Company provides energy-efficient solutions that help its customers effectively manage electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical power more efficiently, safely, and sustainably. Eaton has approximately 95,000 employees in over 60 countries and sells products to customers in more than 175 countries. 
  Summary of Results of Operations 
  A summary of Eaton s Net sales, Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders, and Net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders - diluted follows: 

During 2015, Eaton announced a multi-year restructuring initiative to reduce its cost structure and gain efficiencies in all business segments and at corporate in order to respond to declining market conditions. Restructuring charges in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of   2016   were   $23   and   $121  , respectively, and were   $113   and   $127   in   2015  , respectively. These charges were primarily comprised of severance costs. Restructuring charges are anticipated to be   $145   in   2016   and   $180   in 2017. The projected annualized savings from these restructuring actions are expected to be   $508  , when fully realized in 2018. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  The following discussion of Consolidated Financial Results and Business Segment Results of Operations includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include operating earnings, operating earnings per ordinary share, and operating profit before acquisition integration charges for each business segment as well as corporate, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of operating earnings and operating earnings per ordinary share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the table below. Operating profit before acquisition integration charges is reconciled in the discussion of the operating results of each business segment, and excludes acquisition integration expense related to the integration of Ephesus Lighting, Inc. and Oxalis Group Ltd. in 2016 and primarily Cooper Industries plc in 2015. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they exclude certain transactions, allowing investors to more easily compare Eaton s financial performance period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton and each business segment. For additional information on acquisition integration charges, see Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consolidated Financial Results 

Net Sales 
  Net sales decreased   4%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   due to a decrease of 3% in organic sales and a decrease of 1% from the impact of negative currency translation. Net sales decreased   6%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   due to a decrease of 4% in organic sales and a 2% decrease from the impact of negative currency translation.

The increase in gross profit margin in the   third   quarter of   2016   was primarily due to savings from restructuring actions, other cost control measures and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by lower sales volumes and unfavorable product mix. Gross profit margin increased from   31.2%   in the first   nine   months of   2015   compared to   32.3%   in the first   nine   months of   2016  .

Corporate Expense 

Total corporate expense decreased   12%   from   $258   in the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $226   in the   third   quarter of   2016  .

The decrease in Total corporate expense for the   third   quarter and first   nine   months   2016   was primarily due to a decrease in pension and other postretirement benefits expense resulting from a change to the spot rate approach for measuring service and interest costs, higher discount rates, and updated mortality tables. 

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  Financial Condition and Liquidity 
  Eaton s objective is to finance its business through operating cash flow and an appropriate mix of equity and long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying its debt maturity structure, Eaton reduces liquidity risk. The Company maintains access to the commercial paper markets through a commercial paper program, which is supported by credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000. On October 14, 2016, Eaton refinanced a $750, five-year revolving credit facility with a $750, five-year revolving credit facility that will expire October 14, 2021. Eaton also maintains a $500, four-year revolving credit facility that will expire on October 3, 2018 and a $750, five-year credit facility that will expire October 3, 2019. This refinancing maintains long-term revolving credit facilities at a total of $2,000. There were no borrowings outstanding under these revolving credit facilities at   September 30, 2016   or October 14, 2016. Over the course of a year, cash, short-term investments and short-term debt may fluctuate in order to manage global liquidity. Eaton believes its operating flexibility, cash flow, cash and short-term investment balances, and access to capital markets are substantially in excess of the liquidity necessary to meet future operating needs of the business as well as scheduled payments of long-term debt. 
  On September 20, 2016, a subsidiary of Eaton issued Euro denominated notes (Euro Notes) with a face value of    550   (  $615   based on the September 20, 2016 spot rate), in accordance with Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Euro Notes mature in 2024 with interest payable annually at a rate of   0.75%  . The issuer received proceeds totaling    544   (  $609   based on the September 20, 2016 spot rate) from the issuance, net of financing costs and discounts.  
  Eaton was in compliance with each of its debt covenants for all periods presented. 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Operating Cash Flow 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $1,914   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , an increase of $285 in the source of cash compared to   $1,629   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the first   nine   months of   2016   was driven by lower pension contributions. 
  Investing Cash Flow 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $371   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , a decrease of $2 in the use of cash compared to   $373   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The slight decrease was primarily driven by no business acquisitions completed in 2016 and lower capital expenditures in   2016   compared to   2015  , offset by purchases of short-term investments of   $29   in   2016   compared to sales of   $76   in   2015  . 
  Financing Cash Flow 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $1,325   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , a decrease of $264 in the use of cash compared to   $1,589   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in the use of cash was due to an increase in proceeds from borrowings, which totaled   $633   in   2016  , partially offset by an increase of $261 in payments on borrowings and an increase of $113 in share repurchases in   2016   compared to   2015  .
