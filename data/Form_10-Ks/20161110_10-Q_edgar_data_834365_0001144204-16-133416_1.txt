1.   Organization and Significant Accounting Policies                  

Business   

BioLife Solutions, Inc. ( BioLife, 
 us,   we,   our,  or the  Company ) is the leading developer, manufacturer and
marketer of proprietary clinical grade cell and tissue hypothermic storage and cryopreservation freeze media and a related cloud
hosted biologistics cold chain management app for smart shippers. Our proprietary HypoThermosol  and CryoStor  platform
of solutions are highly valued in the biobanking, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine markets. Our biopreservation media
products are serum-free and protein-free, fully defined, and are formulated to reduce preservation-induced cell damage and death.
Our enabling technology provides commercial companies and clinical researchers significant improvement in shelf life and post-preservation
viability and function of cells, tissues, and organs. Additionally, for our direct, distributor, and contract customers, we perform
custom formulation, fill, and finish services. 

Basis of Presentation   

We have prepared the accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).
Pursuant to these rules and regulations, we have condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosures we normally
include in our annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America ( GAAP ). In management s opinion, we have made all adjustments (consisting only
of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary to fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our
interim period operating results do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for
the full year. These consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 on file with the SEC. 

There have been no material changes to
our significant accounting policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the financial statements in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Principles of Consolidation    

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. 

Concentrations of credit risk and
business risk   

In the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, we derived approximately 25% of our product revenue from two customers and 12% of our product revenue from one customer,
respectively. In each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we derived approximately 10% of our product revenue
from one customer. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016
or 2015. At September 30, 2016, two customers accounted for approximately 35% of total gross accounts receivable. At December 31,
2015, three customers accounted for approximately 53% of total gross accounts receivable. 

Revenue from customers located in foreign
countries represented 15% and 18% of total revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 21%
of total revenue during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU-2016-09). The updated guidance simplifies and changes how companies
account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and
statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of certain items in the statement of cash flows. Adoption of
ASU 2016-09 is required for fiscal reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within
those fiscal years with early adoption being permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the pending
adoption of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 

7   

In February 2016, FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases: Topic 842 (ASU 2016-02) that replaces existing lease guidance. The new standard is intended
to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities
on the balance sheet. Under the new guidance, leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating, with classification
affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged
under ASU 2016-02. Adoption of ASU 2016-02 is required for fiscal reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim reporting periods within those fiscal years with early adoption being permitted. The new standard is required to be applied
with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented with various optional practical expedients. The
Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: Topic 825 (ASU 2016-01).
The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure. Adoption of ASU 2016-01 is required for fiscal reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact
of the pending adoption of ASU 2016-01 on its consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2016-01
to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2015, FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes: Topic 740 (ASU 2015-17). Current GAAP requires the
deferred taxes for each jurisdiction to be presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability.
This requires a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis based on the classification of the assets and liabilities to which the underlying
temporary differences relate, or, in the case of loss or credit carryforwards, based on the period in which the attribute is expected
to be realized. Any valuation allowance is then required to be allocated on a pro rata basis, by jurisdiction, between current
and noncurrent deferred tax assets. The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related
valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net
noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting
within a jurisdiction. Adoption of ASU 2015-17 is required for fiscal reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, and either prospective or retrospective application is permitted. Early adoption
of ASU 2015-17 is permitted. At the time of adoption, all of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with
any related valuation allowance, will be classified as noncurrent on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company does not plan
to early adopt ASU 2015-17. The Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2015-17 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory: Topic 330 (ASU 2015-11). Topic 330 currently requires an entity to measure inventory
at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately
normal profit margin. ASU 2015-11 requires that inventory measured using either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost
method be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary
course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Adoption of ASU 2015-11 is required
for fiscal reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years.
The Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

On May 28, 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to
be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue
recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect
transition method. Early adoption is not permitted. The updated standard becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal
2018. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have
on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

8   

With the exception of the new standards
discussed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance, or potential significance,
to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss    

The following table shows the changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Loss by component for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

3.
Fair Value Measurement    

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820,
 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  ( ASC Topic 820 ), the Company measures its cash and cash equivalents
and short term investments at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing
the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier value
fair hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level 1   Observable inputs that
reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2   Observable inputs other
than quoted prices included in Level 1 for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets
or liabilities. 

Level 3   Unobservable data points
for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company does not have liabilities that are measured at fair value. 

The following tables set forth the Company's
financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, based
on the three-tier fair value hierarchy: 

The fair values of bank deposits, money
market funds, corporate debt securities and commercial paper classified as Level 1 were derived from quoted market prices as active
markets for these instruments exist. The Company has no level 2 or level 3 financial assets. The Company did not have any transfers
between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the twelve months ended
December 31, 2015. 

9   

4.   Inventory      

Inventory consists of the following at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015: 

5. Deferred Rent    

Deferred rent consists of the
following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

During the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $31,749 and $95,248, respectively, in deferred rent amortization of these
landlord funded leasehold improvements. During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded
$31,750 and $95,250, respectively, in deferred rent amortization of these landlord funded leasehold improvements. 

Straight line rent adjustment
represents the difference between cash rent payments and the recognition of rent expense on a straight-line basis over the terms
of the lease. 

   6. Share-based Compensation

Stock Options   

The following is a summary of
stock option activity for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, and the status of stock options outstanding at September
30, 2016: 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $600,548
of aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding stock options, including $559,855 of aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable stock
options. Intrinsic value is the total pretax intrinsic value for all  in-the-money  options (i.e., the difference between
the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number
of shares) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on September 30,
2016. This amount will change based on the fair market value of the Company s stock. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 intrinsic value of awards exercised was $5,635 and $51,302, respectively. Weighted average grant date fair value
for options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.32 and $1.26 per share, respectively and $1.90
and $1.75 for the three and nine months, respectively, ended September 30, 2015. 

10   

The fair value of share-based
payments made with stock options to employees and non-employee directors was estimated on the measurement date using the Black-Scholes
model using the following weighted average assumptions. 

Management applies an estimated forfeiture
rate that is derived from historical employee termination data. The estimated forfeiture rate applied for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 8.1% and 7.0%, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $1,743,879
of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options. We expect to recognize this compensation expense over a
weighted average period of approximately 3.0 years. 

Restricted Stock   

The following is a summary of restricted
stock activity for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, and the status of unvested restricted stock outstanding at September
30, 2016: 

The aggregate fair value of the awards
granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0 and $380,000, respectively, which represents the market
value of BioLife common stock on the date that the restricted stock awards were granted. The aggregate fair value of the restricted
stock awards that vested for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $22,217 and $138,921, respectively. 

We recognized stock compensation expense,
net of forfeiture credits of $21,320 and $144,671 related to restricted stock awards for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, there was $204,661 in unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock awards. We
expect to recognize those costs over 2.5 years. 

We recorded stock compensation expense
for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as follows: 

11   

During the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016, we reversed stock compensation expense related to stock compensation expense previously recorded on unvested
stock options that were forfeited upon termination of certain employees during the periods in the amount of $98 and $40,630 to
cost of product sales, respectively and $2,935 and $54,965 to operating expenses, respectively. 

   7. Warrants    

At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, we had 7,603,141 and 7,195,997 warrants outstanding, respectively, and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price
of $4.46 and $4.60, respectively. The outstanding warrants have expiration dates between May 2017 and May 2021. 

8.
Net Loss per Common Share                    

Basic net loss per common share is calculated
by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share
is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding
during the period. Common stock equivalents are excluded for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
since the effect is anti-dilutive due to the Company s net losses. Common stock equivalents include stock options and warrants. 

Basic weighted average common shares outstanding,
and the potentially dilutive securities excluded from loss per share computations because they are anti-dilutive, are as follows
as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

9. Commitments
  Contingencies  

Leases  

We lease approximately 30,000 square feet
in our Bothell, Washington headquarters. The term of our lease continues until July 31, 2021 with two options to extend the term
of the lease, each of which is for an additional period of five years, with the first extension term commencing, if at all, on
August 1, 2021, and the second extension term commencing, if at all, immediately following the expiration of the first extension
term. In accordance with the amended lease agreement, our monthly base rent is approximately $59,700, with scheduled annual increases
each August and again in October for the most recent amendment. We are also required to pay an amount equal to the Company s
proportionate share of certain taxes and operating expenses. 

Employment agreements  

We have employment agreements with our
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Vice President of Operations, Vice President of Marketing,
and Vice President of Sales. None of these employment agreements is for a definitive period, but rather each will continue indefinitely
until terminated in accordance with its terms. The agreements provide for a base annual salary, payable in monthly (or shorter)
installments. In addition, the agreement with the Chief Executive Officer provides for incentive bonuses at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. Under certain conditions and for certain of these officers, we may be required to pay additional amounts upon
terminating the officer or upon the officer resigning for good reason. 

biologistex  

Our biologistex joint venture committed
to purchase approximately $2.4 million in Smart Containers from SAVSU Technologies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and
our joint venture partner ( SAVSU ). As of September 30, 2016, the remaining purchase commitment is $1.9 million. 

Litigation   

From time to time, the Company is subject
to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, none of which are currently material to the Company s
business. 

12   

10.   Credit Facility  

On May 12, 2016 we entered into a $4
million credit facility agreement with our largest shareholder WAVI Holding AG ( WAVI ). The agreement calls for
WAVI to provide four $1 million tranches at specified times throughout the 12 months from the commencement of the facility
agreement. The promissory note carries an annual interest rate of 10%, matures on June 1, 2017, and is unsecured, but senior
to any existing debt. In conjunction with the credit facility, we issued 550,000 detachable vested warrants at a $1.75
exercise price, expiring May 12, 2021. On June 1, 2016, we received the first $1 million tranche and on September 1, 2016, we
received the second $1 million tranche related to the credit facility agreement. The Company recorded a debt discount related
to the value of the warrants in the amount of $374,390. The debt discount amount recorded related to the warrants was
determined based on the relative fair value of the note payable and the warrants. The debt discount will amortize monthly at
a rate of $31,199 per month until June 1, 2017. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes
model.

Overview  

Management s discussion and analysis
provides additional insight into the Company and is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC. 

We were incorporated in Delaware in 1987
under the name Trans Time Medical Products, Inc. In 2002, the Company, then known as Cryomedical Sciences, Inc., and engaged in
manufacturing and marketing cryosurgical products, completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, BioLife Solutions, Inc.,
which was engaged as a developer and marketer of biopreservation tools for cells and tissues. Following the merger, we changed
our name to BioLife Solutions, Inc. We have one majority-owned subsidiary (52%), biologistex CCM, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company. 

Our proprietary, clinical grade HypoThermosol 
FRS and CryoStor  biopreservation media products are marketed to the regenerative medicine, biobanking and drug discovery markets,
including hospital-based stem cell transplant centers, pharmaceutical companies, cord blood and adult stem cell banks, hair transplant
centers, and suppliers of cells to the drug discovery, toxicology testing and diagnostic markets. All of our biopreservation media
products are serum-free and protein-free, fully defined, and are manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)
using United States Pharmacopia (USP)/Multicompendial or the highest available grade components. 

14   

Our patented biopreservation media products
are formulated to reduce preservation-induced, delayed-onset cell damage and death. Our platform enabling technology provides our
customers significant shelf life extension of biologic source material and final cell products, and also greatly improved post-preservation
cell, tissue, and organ viability and function. 

The discoveries made by our scientists
and consultants relate to how cells, tissues, and organs respond to the stress of hypothermic storage, cryopreservation, and the
thawing process. These discoveries enabled the formulation of innovative biopreservation media products that protect biologic material
from preservation-related cellular injury, much of which is not apparent immediately after return to normothermic body temperature.
Our product formulations have demonstrated notable reduction in apoptotic (programmed) and necrotic (pathologic) cell death mechanisms
and are enabling the clinical and commercial development of dozens of innovative regenerative medicine products. 

On September 29, 2014, we entered into
a limited liability company agreement with SAVSU to create a 20-year joint venture for the purpose of acquiring, developing, maintaining,
owning, operating, marketing and selling an integrated platform of a cloud-based information service and precision thermal shipping
products. The evo  line is a new line of  smart shippers  designed for the shipment of materials, which must
be maintained frozen, at 2-8 C and/or controlled room temperature temperatures and where near real time monitoring of temperature,
location, and payload status information is necessary. A sophisticated electronics package embedded in the evo provides streaming
data to the biologistex web-based application; where real time shipment status, history, and reports can be generated. Designed
for small volume shipments; it fills a critical need in chain-of-custody scenarios for temperature sensitive shipments of cells,
tissues, and other cell based products. 

Highlights
for      the Third Quarter of 2016   

Biopreservation media products revenue was $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase
of 31% over the same period in 2015. For the first nine months of 2016, biopreservation media product revenue increased 32% as
compared to last year. Third quarter revenue growth drivers include 39% higher direct sales to our regenerative medicine customers
compared to the same period in 2015 as well as higher sales through our distribution network partially offset by a decline in sales
to our hair transplantation customers.   

Consolidated net loss for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.3 million and net loss attributable
to BioLife was $1.0 million or $0.08/share compared to a consolidated net loss of $1.3 million and net loss attributable to BioLife
of $1.1 million or $0.09/share in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in loss for the third quarter is primarily due to SAVSU
participation fees in 2015, offset by an increase in biologistex and biopreservation media development costs. Consolidated net
loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.5 million and net loss attributable to BioLife was $3.6 million or $0.28/share,
compared to consolidated net loss of $3.6 million and net loss attributable to BioLife was $3.1 million or $0.26/share in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the loss for the nine month period is primarily the result of increased headcount
and spending related to the development and launch activities of our biologistex joint venture.   

Supply Agreements: Executed 10 year Supply Agreements with Kite Pharma and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals.   

Product Use Disclosures: Embedded in Cook MyoSite  phase 3 cell therapy clinical trial for
stress urinary incontinence, integrated in Kolon Group's cell-mediated gene therapy for osteoarthritis, and used in the manufacturing
process for Promethera Biosciences HepaStem cell-based treatment for liver disorders.   

Customer Adoption: Management believes that BioLife products are now embedded in over 230 pre-clinical
validation projects and human clinical trials for new cell and tissue-based regenerative medicine products and therapies, including
21 phase III trials.   

Results of Operations  

Our revenue, results of operations and
cash balances may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter. These fluctuations could be due to a number of factors, including
the progress of our customers  clinical trials, where the pace of enrollment affects customer orders for our products. The
majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors. Each of these
sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific. Any weakness in the market
sectors in which our customers are concentrated could affect our business and results of operations. 

15   

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three and
Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Percentage comparisons have been omitted
within the following table where they are not considered meaningful. 

Revenue and Gross Margin  

Biopreservation Media Product Sales.
 Our core products are sold through both direct and indirect channels to customers in the regenerative medicine, biobanking
and drug discovery markets. Sales of our core proprietary products in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased
31% and 32%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, due primarily to an increase in products sold and an increase
in selling price per liter sold due to changes in product mix sold and customized biopreservation media formulations. Proprietary
revenue growth in the current quarter was driven by a 39% increase in our regenerative medicine segment and 23% increase in our
US and international distributors. The hair transplantation segment decreased 39% year over year due to the large orders placed
in the third quarter of 2015. We expect to see continued growth in adoption and use of our proprietary biopreservation media products,
and estimate at least 25% growth in core product revenue for the full year over 2015. 

Contract Manufacturing Services. 
We had no contract manufacturing revenue in the first three quarters of 2016. In 2015, the contract manufacturing revenue was the
result of process validation work performed for one customer and sales of certain raw materials related to this customer. 

Cost of Sales.  Cost of sales consists
of raw materials, labor and overhead expenses. Cost of sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased compared
to the same periods in 2015 due to increased sales of our proprietary products and overhead costs. 

Gross Margin.  Gross margin as a
percentage of revenue was 57% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 60% and 58% in the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The margin is slightly lower due to an increase in raw material and overhead costs. For the full
year, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 55% to 60% on core biopreservation media products. 

Revenue Concentration.  In the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we derived approximately 25% of our product revenue from two customers and 12% of our
product revenue from one customer, respectively. In each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we derived approximately
10% of our product revenue from one customer. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

16   

Operating Expenses   

Our operating expenses for the three and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were: 

Research and Development.  Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, consulting and other outside services,
laboratory supplies, and other costs. We expense all research and development costs as incurred, with the exception of certain
costs associated with the development of customized internal-use software systems that are capitalizable. Research and development
expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, due primarily to expensed costs related to customized internal-use software and costs associated with new media and biologistex
product development. 

Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing
expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, consulting, trade shows and advertising. The increase
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 was due primarily to higher personnel
costs and costs related to marketing activities of our biologistex joint venture. 

General and Administrative Expenses.
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, non-cash stock-based compensation for
administrative personnel and members of the board of directors, professional fees, such as accounting and legal, corporate insurance,
and participation fees to SAVSU related to the biologistex joint venture. The decrease in general and administrative expenses
in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is due to no joint venture participation fees
in 2016. The increase in other general and administrative costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same
period in 2015 were due to higher personnel costs, including employee relocation expenses and severance expense for two former
executives in the first quarter of 2016, and stock-based compensation related to new issuances of options and restricted stock
grants in the first quarter of 2016 offset by SAVSU participation fees in 2015. 

Other Income (Expenses)   

Interest Expense.  The interest expense
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due to the note payable related to the credit facility financing arrangement
entered into in May 2016. 

Amortization of debt discount.  The
amortization of short-term debt discount in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due to the amortization of the
allocated value of the detachable warrants associated with the credit facility financing on arrangement entered into in May 2016. 

Write off of deferred financing costs.
 The write off of deferred financing costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due to the write off of deferred
capital costs related to Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on January 8, 2016. 

17   

Loss on disposal of property and equipment.
 The loss on asset disposal in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due to the disposal of property and equipment
with net book value. 

Interest Income.  The reduction in
interest income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is due to the lower average
short-term investments balance in 2016 compared to 2015. 

Liquidity   

On September 30, 2016, we had $1.4 million
in cash and cash equivalents, compared to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.8 million at December 31,
2015. 

On May 12, 2016, we entered into a $4
million credit facility with our largest shareholder, WAVI Holding AG ( WAVI ), pursuant to which WAVI agreed to make
a series of four $1 million advances on June 1, 2016, September 1, 2016, December 1, 2016 and March 1, 2017 (each, an  Advance ).
We entered into a promissory note (the  Note ) in favor of WAVI whereby we agreed to pay WAVI the principal amount
of all Advances under the Note, plus interest. We also issued WAVI 5 year warrants to purchase 550,000 shares of common stock
at a fixed exercise price of $1.75 per share. The Note is unsecured, carries an annual interest rate of 10% and matures on June
1, 2017. WAVI is not obligated to pay any Advance if an event of default (as defined in the Note) has occurred or is occurring.
In addition, if an event of default has occurred, WAVI may, at its option, declare the Note to be immediately due and payable,
together with all unpaid interest, without further notice or demand. The Note also provides that we will not permit any liens
on our assets, subject to certain exceptions. On June 1, 2016, we received the first $1 million Advance and on September 1, 2016,
we received the second $1 million Advance. 

We believe the remaining $2 million of
Advances, when combined with cash from operations, will be sufficient to reach positive cash flow from operations, which we expect
next year. However, our funds from operations may not be sufficient to repay the Note on its maturity date. Accordingly, we may
need to obtain additional debt or equity financing or negotiate with WAVI an amendment to the maturity date or terms of the Note
prior to the existing maturity date. If we are unable to comply with the terms of the Note as of the date of any Advance, we may
need to take such actions of an earlier date. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so on favorable terms, or
at all. See Part II, Item 1.A. Risk Factors. 

We are continuously monitoring and evaluating
opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet and competitive position over the long term. These actions may include acquisitions
or other strategic transactions that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business.
The consideration we pay in such transactions may include, among other things, shares of our common stock, other equity or debt
securities of our Company or cash. We may elect to seek debt or equity financing in anticipation of, or in connection with, such
transactions. 

Net Cash Used In Operating Activities   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $3.7 million compared to $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. Cash used in operating activities did not change from the prior period because the use of cash to fund higher net losses
was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. 

Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities   

Net cash provided by investing activities
totaled $0.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was the result of sales and maturities of short term
investments, net of purchases of equipment and $0.9 million of costs associated with internal use software development during
the period. Cash provided by investing activities totaled $3.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which
was the result of sales and maturities of short term investments, net of purchases of short term investments and purchases of
equipment and $0.9 million of costs associated with internal use software development during the quarter. 

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities   

Net cash provided by financing activities
was $2.2 million and $0.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash provided by financing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was the result of proceeds received from our credit facility, warrant
exercises and employee stock option exercises net of cash payments related to the filing of the Registration Statement on Form
S-3. Net cash provided by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was the result of proceeds received
from employee stock option exercises. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30, 2016, we did not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

18   

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant
Judgments and Estimates  

Management s discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements requires
that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as reported revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, including, but not limited to those related to accounts receivable
allowances, determination of fair value of share-based compensation, contingencies, income taxes, useful lives and impairment of
intangible assets and internal use software, and expense accruals. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other
factors that we believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Our critical accounting policies and estimates
have not changed significantly from those policies and estimates disclosed under the heading  Critical Accounting Policies
and Significant Judgments and Estimates  in Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Conditions and Results of Operations  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015,
filed with the SEC. 

Contractual Obligations  

We previously disclosed certain contractual
obligations and contingencies and commitments relevant to us within the financial statements and Management Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed
with the SEC on February 25, 2016. There have been no significant changes to these obligations in the nine months ended September
30, 2016. For more information regarding our current contingencies and commitments, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements
included above. 

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk          

Not applicable.  

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures          

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to
be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as required by the rules
and regulations under the Exchange Act, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Control. 
Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been
detected. 

PART II: Other Information  

Item 1.A.   Risk Factors  

We anticipate the need to obtain additional equity or debt
financing or negotiate with WAVI an amendment to the maturity date or terms of the Note, which we may not obtain on favorable terms,
or at all.  

We believe the remaining $2 million of
Advances when combined with cash from operations, will be sufficient to reach positive cash flow from operations, which we expect
next year. However, we cannot assure you that we will receive the remaining Advances, or that our funds will be sufficient for
this period. Our funds from operations may not be sufficient to pay the Note on its current maturity date. Accordingly, we expect
we may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing or negotiate with WAVI an amendment to the maturity date or terms of
the Note prior to the existing maturity date. Any new equity financing, including any equity issued in connection with debt financings
or amendments, may dilute our existing shareholders and may adversely affect our stock price. If we are unable to comply with the
terms of the Note, obtain any required financing or comply with any amendment to the Note, our business and financial condition
may be adversely affected.
