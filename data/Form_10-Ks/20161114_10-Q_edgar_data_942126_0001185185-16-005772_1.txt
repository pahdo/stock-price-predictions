1   ORGANIZATION

In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California.  We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two subsidiaries in each of Taiwan (since 1998) and China (since 2005).  Our Mexico location closed all operations in May 2013 (final closure is pending sale of our local 15,000 sqft office and warehouse facility) and our Taiwan and China locations are for supporting overseas customers, inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our products.  Our China location also serves as the engineering center responsible for designing circuits, arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports.

2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned subsidiaries, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations for the interim periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been included.  Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year.  These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  In preparing these financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant estimates and assumptions included in the Company s consolidated financial statements relate to  the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes.   Certain amounts in the prior year consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

3   RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ), which are adopted by the Company as of the specified date.  Unless otherwise discussed, management believes the impact of recently issued standards, some of which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The guidance is designed to identify areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.   Early adoption is permitted.    The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which establishes the principles to report transparent and economically neutral information about the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. This guidance results in the Company providing a more faithful representation of the rights and obligations arising from operating and capital leases by requiring lessees to recognize the lease assets and lease liabilities that arise from leases in the statement of financial position and to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about lease transactions, such as information about variable lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases. This guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.   Early adoption is permitted.   The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.

4   INVENTORY

Inventory   Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or estimated market value.  We had inventory balances in the amount of $8,124,000 and $9,015,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $6,037,000 and $5,674,000, respectively.  We evaluate inventories to identify excess, high-cost, slow-moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins.  Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories.  Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value.  If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories may be required.  In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated.

5   OTHER ASSETS

Our $100,000 investment in securities as of September 30, 2016 relates to our ownership of 1,037,739 common shares of Zowie Technology Corporation (New Taipei City, Taiwan), a supplier of electronic component products.  Our investment relates to approximately 9.2% of their total outstanding shares although we do not have significant influence or control.  This investment is accounted for under the cost method basis of accounting.

Our $375,000 investment in joint venture as of September 30, 2016, relates to our 49% ownership of Grand Shine Management Limited (Dong Guan, China), an electronic device contract manufacturer, and joint venture with its 51% owner, Teamforce Company Limited.  This joint venture is not considered to be a  Variable Interest Entity , and as such, is accounted for under the equity method basis of accounting.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we have recorded cumulative unrealized loss from the inception of our investment in Grand Shine Management of $801,000 and $605,000, respectively.

6   LONG-TERM DEBT FROM RELATED PARTY

Secured credit facility - On April 21, 2008 we entered into a $3,000,000 credit facility, collateralized by real property, from K.S. Best International Co. Ltd., a company controlled by the brother of our Chief Executive Officer.  Credit is available in $500,000 advances, each advance payable in monthly interest only installments, at the rate of Prime + 0.25% per annum.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate outstanding balance on this credit facility was $1,500,000.  Effective on September 30, 2016, we executed a fourth amendment to the secured credit facility agreement extending the due dates of the unpaid balances to periods from between June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2019.

7   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

We made payments to K.S. Best International Co. Ltd., a company controlled by the brother of our Chief Executive Officer of approximately $6,000 for both of the quarters ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 and approximately $18,000 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  These payments were for professional fees related to the operational management of our Taiwan office.  In addition, we also made payments of approximately $14,000 for both of the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and approximately $42,000 and $39,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for interest expense on our credit facility from K.S. Best International Co. Ltd.  See Note 6.

8   SHARE BASED COMPENSATION

Accounting for stock options issued to employees measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  That cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.  Outstanding options to purchase Class A common stock ( the Options ) vest in three equal annual installments beginning one year from the date of grant and are subject to termination provisions as defined in our 2005 Stock Incentive Plan.   The option activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

At September 30, 2016 the range of individual outstanding weighted average exercise prices was $0.98 to $1.37.

9   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Inventory Purchasing 

Outstanding commitments to purchase inventory from suppliers aggregated $1,500,000 as of September 30, 2016.

10   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On November 4, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.025 per share of Class A and Class B common stock for a total amount of $138,000.  The dividend will be paid on November 30, 2016 to stockholders of record as of November 14, 2016.  Under the existing dividend policy announced in May 2016, the Company will target a cash dividend to the Company's stockholders in the amount of $0.10 per share per annum, payable in equal quarterly installments.  Subsequent dividend declarations and the establishment of record and payment dates for such future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend policy is in the best interests of the Company's stockholders.  The dividend policy may be suspended or cancelled at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time.

Item 2.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  . 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Use of Estimates - Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition   Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise, which is when legal transfer of title occurs.  Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns.  Sales returns for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $4,000 and $50,000, respectively and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $74,000 and $58,000, respectively.  The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 aggregated $48,000 and $47,000, respectively.

Inventory   Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or estimated market value.  We had inventory balances in the amount of $8,124,000 and $9,015,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $6,037,000 and $5,674,000, respectively.  We evaluate inventories to identify excess, high-cost, slow-moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins.  Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories.  Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value.  If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories may be required.  In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated.

Overview

We distribute brand name electronic components and supply original designed and manufactured ( ODM ) electronic components ( ODM Components ), with our product offerings ranging from discrete semiconductors through small electronic devices.  We also offer value-added engineering and turn-key solutions, focusing on providing contract electronic manufacturers ( CEM s) and original equipment manufacturers ( OEM s) with ODM services for their multi-year turn-key projects ( ODM Projects  or  Projects ).

We place emphasis on increasing our sales to existing customers through further expansion of the number of different types of discrete components and other integrated circuits in our inventory and by attracting additional contract electronic manufacturers ( CEMs ), OEMs and electronics distributor customers.  In addition,  we have developed our ODM service capabilities and added products developed through partnership agreements with offshore solution providers (OEMs and CEMs).

Table of Contents 

Our core strategy of electronic components fulfillment, however, consists of carrying a substantial quantity and variety of products in inventory to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers.  This strategy allows us to fill customer orders immediately from stock on hand.  Although we believe better market conditions may return, we are focused on lowering our inventory balances and increasing our cash holdings.  Our long-term strategy is to rely not only on our core strategy of component fulfillment service, but also our Projects of value-added engineering services and turn-key solutions.

In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our September 30, 2016, consolidated financial statements representing approximately 64% of current assets and 47% of total assets.  However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.  We cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve.  Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result.

Our gross profit margins are subject to a number of factors, including product demand, strength of the U.S. dollar, our ability to purchase inventory at favorable prices and our sales product mix.

Results of Operations

Third quarter of 2016 versus 2015. 

Net sales in the third quarter of 2016 totaled $1,621,000 versus $1,672,000 in the comparable period for 2015, a decrease of $51,000 or 3.1% over the same period last year .

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2016 was $585,000 versus $522,000 in the comparable period for 2015, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 36.1% in the third quarter of 2016 versus 31.2% in the comparable period for 2015.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2016 totaled $511,000 versus $497,000 in the comparable period for 2015.

Interest expense, net of interest income, was $17,000 for the third quarter of 2016 and $12,000 in the comparable period for 2015.

Other income, net of other expense, in t he third quarter of 2016 was $22,000 versus $9,000 in the comparable period for 2015.  Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess space at our headquarters  facility in Valencia, CA.

Income tax provision was $4,000 for the third quarter of 2016 and in 2015, as we do not expect significant taxable income.

Net income was $15,000 for the third quarter of 2016 versus net loss of $46,000 in the comparable period for 2015, an increase of $61,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    .  

Net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $5,223,000 versus $4,484,000 in the comparable period for 2015, an increase of $739,000 or 16.5% over the same period last year.

Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,841,000 versus $1,333,000 in the comparable period for 2015, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 35.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 29.7% for 2015, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $1,596,000 versus $1,581,000 in the comparable period for 2015.

Interest expense, net of interest income, was $39,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $32,000 in the comparable period for 2015.

Other income, net of other losses, in t he nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $49,000 versus $58,000 in the comparable period for 2015.

Income tax provision was $10,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus $11,000 in 2015.

Table of Contents 

Net income was $55,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus net loss of $435,000 in the comparable period for 2015, an increase of $490,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $710,000 as opposed to $424,000 in the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The increase of $286,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from reductions of inventory and accounts receivables compared to the prior period.

Cash flows used in investing activities were $6,000 and $26,000 for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Cash flows used in financing activities were $776,000 and $0 for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn.  Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.

We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.  If these funds are  not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of November 14, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. -  Not applicable.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
