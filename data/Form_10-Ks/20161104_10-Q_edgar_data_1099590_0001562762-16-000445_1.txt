2.   Summary of significant accounting policies 

Basis of presentation 

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and   its wholly-owned subsidiaries.   These interim condensed consolidated financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars  , except for amounts otherwise indicated  . Intercompany transactions and balances   with subsidiaries   have been eliminated for consolidation purposes. 

Substantially all net revenues, cost of net revenues and operating expenses, are generated in the Company s foreign operations, amounting to   approximately   99.9%   and   99.7%   of the con  solidated amounts during the nine  -month periods ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015. Long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill located in the foreign operations totaled   $232,819   thousands and   $184,178   thousands as of   September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

These interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the Company s consolidated financial position   as of   September 30  , 201  6    and December 31, 201  5  . These financial statements also show the Company s consolidated statements of income   and   comprehensive income for the   nine and   three-month periods ended   September 30  , 201  6   and 201  5; and   statement of cash flows   for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . These interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments that management believes are necessary to fairly state the Company s financial position, operating results and cash flows. 

Because all of the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements are not included herein, these unaudited interim condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 201  5  , contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The condensed consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income and of cash flows for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of results expected for any future period.   For a more detailed discussion of the Company s significant accounting policies, see note 2 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, there were no material updates made to the Company s significant accounting policies. 

Foreign currency translation 

All of the Company s foreign operations have determined the local currency to be their functional currency, except for Venezuela since January 1, 2010, as described below. Accordingly, these foreign   operating   subsidiaries translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies   into U.S. dollars by using period  -end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average rates in effect during the   period  , unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of the transaction are used. The resulting translat  ion adjustment is recorded as a   component of other comprehensive     (loss)   income.

Venezuelan currency status 

Pursuant   to U.S. GAAP, the Company has transitioned its Venezuelan operations to highly inflationary status as from January 1, 2010, which requires that transactions and balances are re-measured as if the U.S. dollar was the functional currency for such operation. The cumulative     three     year inflation rate as of December 31, 2010 exceeded     100%  . The Company continues to treat the economy of Venezuela as highly-inflationary. Therefore,     no     translation effect was accounted for in other comprehensive income     related to the Venezuelan operations. 

O  n February 10, 2015, the Venezuelan government issued a decree that unified the two previous foreign exchange systems  SICAD 1 and SICAD 2  into a new single system   (  SICAD  )  , with an initial public foreign exchange   rate   of   12   BsF per U.S. dollar. The SICAD auction process remains available only to obtain foreign currency to pay for a limited list of goods considered to be of high priority by the Venezuelan government, which does not include those relating to the Company s business. In the same decree the Venezuelan government created the  Sistema Marginal de Divisas  ( SIMADI ), a new foreign exchange system that is separate from SICAD, which publishes a foreign exchange rate from the   Central Bank of Venezuela (   BCV   )   on a daily basis.  

In light of the disappearance of SICAD 2, and the Company s inability to gain access to U.S. dollars under SICAD, it started requesting and was granted U.S. dollars through SIMADI. As a result, the Company from that moment expected to settle its transactions through SIMADI   going forward   and concluded that the SIMADI exchange rate should be used to re-measure its bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities and to re-measure the revenues and expenses of the Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of March 31, 2015. In connection with this re-measurement, the Company recorded a foreign exchange loss of   $20.4   million during the first quarter of 2015.  

Considering this change in facts and circumstances and the lower U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows then expected from the Venezuelan business, the Company reviewed its long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life for impairment and concluded that the carrying value of certain real estate investments in Venezuela as of March 31, 2015 would not be fully recoverable. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment of long-lived assets of $   16.2   million on March 31, 2015. The carrying amount   was   adjusted to its estimated fair value of approximately   $9.2   million as of   March 31, 2015  , by using the market approach, and considering prices for similar assets. 

On March 9, 2016 the   BCV   issued the Exchange Agreement No.35, which   is effective since   March 10, 2016. The agreement established a  protected  exchange rate (     DIPRO     ) for certain transactions, such as but not limited to: imports of goods of the food and health sectors, as well as supplies associated with the production of said sectors; expenses relating to health treatments, sports, culture, scientific research, and other urgent matters defined by the exchange regulations. All foreign currency transactions not expressly provided in Exchange Agreement No.35 will be processed on the alternate foreign currency markets governed by the exchange regulations, at the floating supplementary market exchange rate (     DICOM     ). 

Additionally, the agreement established that the alternate foreign currency markets referred to in Exchange Agreement No.33 of February 10, 2015 (SIMADI) will continue to operate until replaced by others. As of the date of issuance of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the SIMADI has not been replaced and for that reason,   the Company   continued using SIMADI. From March 31, 2016 through June 30, 2016, the SIMADI exchange rate increased from   273   BsF per U.S. dollar to   628   BsF per U.S. dollar, a   130%   increase in the exchange rate.   As a consequence of the local currency devaluation  , the Company recorded a foreign exchange loss of   $4.9   million during the   second   quarter of 201  6  . 

Considering   the   significant devaluation and the lower U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows then expected from the Venezuelan business, the Company reviewed its long-lived assets   (including non-current other assets)  , goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life for impairment and concluded that the carrying value of certain real estate investments in Venezuela as of June 30, 2016 would not be fully recoverable. As a result, on June 30, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment   related to offices and commercial property under construction included within non-current other assets   of   $13.7   million  . The carrying amount   of offices and commercial property under construction   was adjusted to its estimated fair value of approximately   $12.5     million as of June 30, 2016, by using the market approach, and considering prices for similar assets.   As of September 30, 2016, the SIMADI exchange rate was   658.9     BsF per U.S. dollar  . 

Until 2010 the Company was able to obtain U.S. dollars for any purpose, including dividends distribution, using alternative mechanisms other than through the   Commission for the Administration of Foreign Exchange Control   (CADIVI). Those U.S. dollars, obtained at a higher exchange rate than the one offered by CADIVI, and held at U.S. bank accounts of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, were used   until 2012   for dividend distributions from our Venezuelan subsidiaries. The Company has not distributed dividends from the Venezuelan subsidiaries since 2011. 

The following table sets forth the assets, liabilities and net assets of the Company s Venezuelan subsidiaries, before intercompany eliminations of a net liability   of   $13.4     million and   $24.6     million, as   of   September 30  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5   and net revenues for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  :

Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

As of   September 30  , 201  6  , net assets (before intercompany eliminations) of the Venezuelan subsidiaries amounted to approximately   10.0%    o  f consolidated net assets,   and cash and investments of the   Venezuelan subsidiaries held in local currency in Venezuela amounted to   approximately   1.0%   of our consolidated cash and investments. 

The Company s ability to obtain U.S. dollars in Venezuela is negatively affected by the exchange regulations in Venezuela that are described above and elsewhere in these   interim condensed consolidated   financial statements. In addition, its business and ability to obtain U.S. dollars in Venezuela would be negatively affected by additional material devaluations or the imposition of significant additional and more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange by the Venezuelan government. 

Despite the current difficult macroeconomic environment in Venezuela, the Company continues to actively manage, through its Venezuelan subsidiaries, its investment in Venezuela. 

Argentine currency status 

During December 2015 the Argentine peso   exchange rate   increased by approximately   37%   against the U.S. dollar to   13.3   Argentine pesos per U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2015. Due   to this   increase, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a foreign exchange gain of     $18.2   million (as a result of having a net asset position in U.S. dollars) and the reported Other Comprehensive Loss increased by   $22.8   million (as a result of having a net asset position in Argentine pesos). As of   September 30  , 2016 the Argentine Peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was   15.3  . 

Brazilian   currency status 

During     2015,     the           Brazilian Reais   exchange rate     increased in approximately     44%  ,    relative to the U.S. dollar,   from     2.7     Brazilian Reais     per U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2014     to     3.9     Brazilian Reais per U.S. dollar     as of December 31, 2015.      Due to the fluctuations of the Brazilian foreign currency against the U.S. dollar,   the Company   recognized a foreign exchange gain of           $14.6     million during the year 2015. In addition, the reported Other     Comprehensive     Loss of our Brazilian segment     increased     by     $9.0     million during     the year 2015  .     As of   September 30  , 2016 the   Brazilian     Reais   exchange rate against the U.S. dollar   was   3.2  . 

Income and asset taxes 

The Company is subject to U.S. and foreign income taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes following the liability method of accounting which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax loss carry     forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred

tax assets or liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded when, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Company s deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company s income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable, if any, plus the change during the period in the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

On August 17, 2011, the Argentine government issued a new software development law and on September 9, 2013 the regulatory decree was issued, which established the new requirement to become beneficiary of the new software development law. The new decree establishes compliance requirements with annual incremental ratios related to exports of services and research and development expenses that must be achieved to remain within the tax holiday. The Argentine operation will have to achieve certain required ratios annually under the new software development law. 

The Industry Secretary resolution which rules, among other provisions, on the mechanism to file the information to obtain the benefits derived from the new software development law was issued in late February 2014. During May 2014, the Company presented all the required documentation in order to apply for the new software development law. 

On September 17, 2015, the Argentine Industry Secretary issued Resolution 1041/2015 approving the Company s application for eligibility under the new software development law   for the Company s Argentinean subsidiary, Mercadolibre S.R.L. Furthermore, on September 18, 2016,   the Argentine Industry Secretary issued Resolution  s     93/2016 and 97/2016   approving the Company s application for eligibility under the new software development law   for the Company s Argentinean subsidiaries, Neosur S.RL. and Business Vision S.A.   As a result, the Company s Argentinean   subsidiaries have   been granted a tax holiday retroactive from September 18, 2014.   A   portion of the benefits obtained as beneficiaries of the new law is a relief of   60%   of total income tax related to software development activities and a   70%   relief in payroll taxes related to software development activities. 

The new software development law, which provides that beneficiaries must meet certain on-going eligibility requirements, will expire on December 31  , 2019. As a result of the Company s eligibility under the new law, it recorded an income tax benefit of   $16,018   and   $6,823   thousands for the   nine   and   three  -month periods ended   September   30, 2016, respectively. Furthermore, the Company recorded a labor cost benefit of   $4,173   and     $2,167   thousands for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively  . Additionally,   $1,416   and   $631     thousands   were accrued to pay software development law audit fees   during the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively  .   During the third quarter of 2015,   the Company   recorde  d an income tax benefit of   $16,015     thousands, a labor cost benefit of   $4,183   thousands and   $1,414   million were accrued to pay software development law audit fees.   Aggregate per share effect of the Argent  ine tax holiday amounted to   $0.46   and   $0.20   for the   nine   and three-month periods ended   September   30, 2016, respectively. 

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued the Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17). The new guidance requires that deferred income tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. 

The company   elected to apply the amendments retrospectively to all periods presented as it reduce  s   the costs and complexity in current GAAP without affecting the quality of information provided to users of financial statements. 

The quantitative effect of the change on the   December 31, 2015   balance sheet presented was a decrease   in   current deferred tax assets and current deferred tax liabilities of   12,290   thousands   and   2,551   thousands, respectively. Those balances were reclassified to non-current deferred tax assets and non-current deferred tax liabilities as appropriate. Consequently, all deferred taxes were presented as Non-current in balance sheet.  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company included under non-current deferred tax   assets caption the foreign tax credits related to the dividend distributions received from its subsidiaries for a total   amount of     $15,966     thousands and     $10,102     thousands, respectively.

Considering these changes in facts and circumstances and the lower U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows expected from the Venezuelan business, and long-lived assets expected use, the Company concluded that certain real estate investments held in Caracas, Venezuela, should be impaired.   The fair value of long-lived assets was estimated through market approach using level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. These level 3 inputs included, but are not limited to, executed purchase agreements in similar assets and third party valuations.   As a consequence, the Company estimated the fair value of the impaired long-lived assets, and recorded impairment losses of   $13.7   million and   $16.2   million on   June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2015  , respectively.      

Use of estimates 

The preparation of interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used for, but not limited to accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts and chargeback provisions, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life, useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets, impairment of short-term and long-term investments, impairment of long-lived assets, compensation costs relating to the Company s long term retention plan, fair value of convertible debt note, recognition of income taxes and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

On March 8, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-04. When an entity sells a prepaid stored-value product (such as gift cards, telecommunication cards, and traveler s checks), it recognizes a financial liability for its obligation to provide the product holder with the ability to purchase goods or services at a third-party merchant. When a prepaid stored-value product goes unused wholly or partially for an indefinite time period, the amount that remains on the product is referred to as breakage. There currently is diversity in the methodology used to recognize breakage. Subtopic 405-20 includes derecognition guidance for both financial liabilities and nonfinancial liabilities, and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, includes authoritative breakage guidance but excludes financial liabilities. The amendments in this Update provide a narrow scope exception to the guidance in Subtopic 405-20 to require that breakage be accounted for consistent with the breakage guidance in Topic 606. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on the company s financial statements. 

On March 14, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-06. Topic 815 requires that embedded derivatives be separated from the host contract and accounted for separately as derivatives if certain criteria are met, including the  clearly and closely related  criterion. The amendments in this Update clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. The amendments apply to all entities that are issuers of or investors in debt instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt host) with embedded call (put) options. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on the company s financial statements. 

On March 17, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-08. This update releases Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08--Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). The amendments in this Update will clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on the   C  ompany s financial statements. 

On March 30, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-09. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. In addition, the amendments in this Update eliminate the guidance in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which has been deleted. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December

On April 14, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-10.This update releases Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. This Update clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in the new revenue recognition standard. The Update includes targeted improvements based on input the Board received from the Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition and other stakeholders. The Update seeks to proactively address areas in which diversity in practice potentially could arise, as well as to reduce the cost and complexity of applying certain aspects of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basis. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on the Company s financial statements. 

On May 3, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-11 on Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).

The Company is assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on the Company s financial statements.    

On May 9, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients . The amendments in this update address narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. Additionally, the amendments in this update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on the Company s financial statements.  

On June 16, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-13  Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of credit losses on financial instruments . This update amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, this update eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect it s current estimate of all expected credit losses. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP, however this topic will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on the Company s financial statements.      

On August 26, 2016 the FASB issued the    ASU 2016-15 Statement of cash flows (Topic 230): Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments   .   This   update   addresses the following e  ight specific cash flow issues: d  ebt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (COLIs) (including bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLIs)); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.     The new standard is effective for fiscal years     beginning after December 15, 201  7.   The Company is assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on the   C  ompany s financial statements  .   

On October 24, 2016 the FASB issued the    ASU 2016-1  6     Income Taxes (Topic 740):   Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   . This update eliminates   the exception that prohibits recognizing current and deferred income tax consequences for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset or assets have been sold to an outside party. Consequently, this update   requires to   recognize the current and deferred income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer when the transfer occurs.   The new standard is effective for fiscal years     beginning after December 15, 201  7.

3. Net income per share 

Basic earnings per share for the Company s common stock is computed by dividing, net income available to common shareholders attributable to common stock for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 

Diluted earnings per share for the Company s common stock assume the issuance of shares as a consequence of a convertible debt securities conversion event and the effects of assumed share settlement of long term retention plans for earnings per share calculations. 

Net income     per share of common st  ock is as follows for the nine and three  -month periods ended   September 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  : 

For the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 there was no impact on the calculation of diluted earnings per share as a consequence of the consideration of the Convertible Notes and the Long term retention plan referred to above calculated using the  if converted  method and the  treasury stock method  respectively. 

The denominator for diluted net income per share for the   nine and three-month periods ended     September 30  ,     201  6   and     201  5   does not include any effect from the capped call     issued in connection with the notes   because it would be antidilutive. In the event of conversion of any or all of the Notes, the shares that would be delivered to the Company under the     Note hedges are designed to partially neutralize the dilutive effect of the shares that the Company would issue under the Notes.

Notes to Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

As of   September 30  , 201  6 and December 31,2015  , the Company s financial assets valued at fair value consisted of assets   valued using i) Level 1 inputs:   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets)   and  ; ii) Level 2 inputs  :   obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments as well as instruments with inactive markets   at the measurement date. 

As of June 30, 2016 and December 3 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s liabilities were valued at fair value using level 2 inputs and level 3 inputs (valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting Company own assumptions). Fair value of contingent considerations are determined based on the probability of   achievement of the performance targets   arising from each acquisition,   as well as the Company s historical experience with similar arrangements  . For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 the Company recognized in earnings a loss of   $305   thousands   and a loss of   $974   thousands   within   other comprehensive     income  , in relation with contingent considerations. In addition, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company assumed additional contingent considerations for an amount of   $1,215   thousands   and settled contingent considerations for an amount of   $7,347   thousands  . 

The unrealized net gains or loss on short term and long term investments are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. The Company does not anticipate any significant realized losses associated with those investments in excess of the Company s historical cost. 

As of   September 30  , 201  6 and December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost approximated their fair value mainly because of its short term maturity. These assets and liabilities included cash and cash equivalents (excluding money markets funds), accounts receivables, credit card receivables, funds payable to customers, other receivables,   other assets, accounts payable  ,    salaries and   social secu  rity payable, taxes payable  , provisions and other liabilities.   The convertible senior notes, the rest of the loans payable and other financial liabilities approximate their fair value because the interest rates are not materially different from market interest rates  .   

The following table summarizes the fair value level for those financial assets and liabilities of the Company measured at amortized cost as of   September 30  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5  : 

(*)   The fair value of the convertible senior notes (including the equity component) is disclosed in Note 9. 

As of   September 30  , 201  6   and December 31, 201  5  , the Company held   no   direct investments in auction rate securities, collateralized debt   obligations   or structured investment   vehicles  , and does not have any non-financial   assets   or   liabilities   measured at fair value  .

Update on Litigation and Other Legal Matters 

The Company is subject to certain contingent liabilities with respect to existing or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. The Company accrues liabilities when it considers probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. The proceeding-related reserve is based on developments to date and historical information related to actions filed against the Company. As   of   September   30, 2016, the Company had established reserves for proceeding-related contingencies and other estimated contingencies of   $5,644   thousands to cover legal actions against the Company in which its Management has assessed the likelihood of a final adverse outcome as probable. Expected legal costs related to litigations are accrued when the legal service is actually provided. In addition, as of   September   30, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain legal actions considered by the Company s management and its legal counsels to be reasonably possible for an aggregate amount up to   $4,522   thousands  . 

No   loss amount has been accrued for such reasonably possible legal actions of which most significant (individually or in the aggregate) are described below. 

As of   September 30, 2016, there were   58   lawsuits pending against our Argentine subsidiaries in the Argentine ordinary courts and   1,379   pending claims in the Argentine Consumer Protection Agencies, where a lawyer is not required to file or pursue a claim. 

As of   September   30, 2016, there were   seven   claims pending against our Mexican subsidiaries in   the Mexican ordinary courts and   156   claims pending against our Mexican subsidiaries in the Mexican Consumer Protection Agencies, where a lawyer is not required to file or pursue a claim. 

As of   September   30, 2016,   687   legal actions were pending in the Brazilian ordinary courts. In addition,   as of September   30, 2016, there were   2,904   cases still pending in Brazilian consumer courts. Filing and pursuing of an action before Brazilian consumer courts do not require the assistance of a lawyer. 

In most of the cases filed against the Company, the plaintiffs asserted that the Company was responsible for fraud committed against them, or responsible for damages suffered when purchasing an item on the Company s website, when using MercadoPago     or when the Company invoiced them.   Management believes that the Company has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to continue defending them. 

City of S o Paulo Tax Claim 

In 2007  ,   S o Paulo tax authorities asserted taxes and fines against our Brazilian subsidiary relating to the period from 2005 to 2007 in an amount of   $5.9   million according to the exchange rate in effect at that time. As of the date of these consolidated financial statements   and following an administrative determination reducing the fine  , the total amount of the claim is   $4.2   million including surcharges and interest. On August 15, 2011, the Company made a deposit in court of   R$9.5   million, which including accrued interests amounted to   R$13.5   million or   $4.2   million, according to the exchange rate at   September   30, 2016  . The company continues to contest the assessment.   On May 31, 2016, a lower court judge ruled in favor of the Company and the S o Paulo Municipal Council presented a motion to clarify mentioned decision.   As of the date of issuance of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company is still waiting for a decision.

Brazilian preliminary injunction against the Brazilian tax authorities 

On November 6, 2014 the Company s Brazilian subsidiaries requested a preliminary injunction against Receita Federal Do Brasil in order to avoid the income tax withholding over payments remitted by Brazilian subsidiaries to the Argentine subsidiary for the provision of IT support and assistance services; and requested the reimbursement of the amounts improperly withheld in the last five years. The injunction was granted   on the grounds   that such withholding violates the provisions of the convention signed between the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Argentine Republic to prevent double taxation. In August 2015, such injunction was revoked by the first instance judge decision of merit, which was favorable to Receita Federal Do Brasil. The Company presented an appeal in September   2015 and,   as of   September 30, 2016, the Company is waiting fo  r the second instance decision. As a result, the Company started making deposits in court for the controversial amounts. As of   September 30  , 2016, the Company recorded in the balance   sheet deposits in court for   R$20.4   million or   $6.  3   million, according to the exchange rate at   September 30  , 2  016 under the caption n  on-current other assets. 

The Company s management, based on the external   legal counsel opinion, believe  s that the tax position adopted is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position and the existence of favorable decisions of the Federal Regional Courts. For that reason, the Company has not recorded any expense or liability for the controversial amounts. 

Brazilian Federal Tax Claims 

On September 2, 2011, the Brazilian Federal tax authority has asserted taxes and fines against   the Company s   Brazilian   ( MercadoLivre )   subsidiary relating to the income tax for the 2006 period in an amount of   R$5.1     million or   $1.5     million, according to the exchange rate at   September   30, 2016. On September 30, 2011  ,   the Company presented administrative defenses against the authorities  claim. On August 24, 2012  ,   the Company presented its appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals (CARF   Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais) against the tax authorities  claims. On December 5, 2013, the Board of Tax Appeals ruled against MercadoLivre s appeal. The same Board of Tax Appeals recognized as due part of the tax compensation made by the Company, decreasing the outstanding debit to   R$2.0   million or   $616   thousands  ,   according to the exchange rate at September 30, 2016. On November 21, 2014, the Company appealed to the Superior Administrative Court of Tax Appeals.   On September   8, 2016  ,     the Company s   appeal was not accepted. MercadoLivre filed an appeal   to the   Superior Administrative Court of Tax Appeals. As of the date of   these interim condensed consolidated     financial statements,   the Superior Administrative Court of Tax Appeals ruling was still pending.   The Company s management, based on the external   legal counsel opinion, believe  s that the tax position adopted is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position. For that reason, the Company has not recorded any expense or liability for the controversial amounts. 

Other third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that the Company was responsible for fraud committed against them, or that the Company has infringed their intellectual property rights. The underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like the Company are unclear in the jurisdictions where the Company operates. Management believes that additional lawsuits alleging that the Company has violated copyright or trademark laws will be filed against the Company in the future. 

Intellectual property and regulatory claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to resolve, require significant amounts of management time, could require expensive changes in the Company s methods of doing business, or could require the Company to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements. The Company may be subject to patent disputes, and be subject to patent infringement claims as the Company s services expand in scope and complexity. In particular, the Company may face additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of the payments businesses. 

From time to time, the Company is involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as the Company s business expands and the Company grows larger.  

8.   Long term retention plan   ( LTRP ) 

On August 2, 2016, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adopted the 2016 Long-Term Retention Plan ( 2016 LTRP ).   In addition to the annual salary and bonus of each employee  , certain employees ( Eligible Employees ) are eligible to participate in the 2016 LTRP, which provides for the grant   to an eligible employee   of   a cash-settled fixed (a  2016 LTRP Fixed Award ) and a cash-settled variable award, (a  2016 LTRP Variable Award , and together with any 2016 LTRP Fixed Award, the  2016 LTRP Awards ). Each eligible employee will be granted both a 2016 LTRP Fixed Award and a 2016 LTRP Variable Award, in addition to receiving their annual salary and bonus.   In order to receive payment in respect of the 2016 LTRP Awards, each eligible employee must satisfy the performance conditions established by the Board of Directors for such employee. If these conditions are satisfied, the eligible employee will, subject to his or her continued employment as of each applicable payment date, receive the full amount of his or her 2016 LTRP Awards, payable as follows:

2016 LTRP Fixed Award: The eligible employee will receive a fixed payment equal to   16.66%   of his or her 2016 Fixed Award once a year for a period of   six   years starting in March 2017 (the  Annual Fixed Payment ); and     

2016 LTRP Variable Award: On each date the Company pays the Annual Fixed Payment to the eligible employee, he or she will also receive a 2016 LTRP Variable Award payment equal to the product of (i) 16.66% of the applicable 2016 LTRP Variable Award and (ii) the quotient of (a) divided by (b), where (a), the numerator, equals the Applicable Year Stock Price (as defined below) and (b), the denominator, equals the 2015 Stock Price (as defined below). For purposes of the 2016 LTRP, the  2015 Stock Price  shall equal   $111.02   (the average   closing price of the Company s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the final   60  -trading days of 2015) and the  Applicable Year Stock Price  shall equal the average closing price of the Company s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the final 60-trading days of the year preceding the applicable payment date for so long as the Company s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ.     

The following table summarizes the 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 long term retention plan accrued compensation expense for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which are payable in cash according to the decision made by the Board of Directors on August 2, 2016:

9.   2.25% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2019 

On June 30, 2014, the Company issued   $330   million of   2.25%   convertible senior notes due 2019 (the  Notes ). The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company, which pay interest in cash semi-annually, on January 1 and July 1, at a rate of 2.25% per annum. The Notes will mature on   July 1, 2019   unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Notes may be converted, under specific conditions, based on an initial conversion rate of   7.9353   shares of common stock per   $1,000   principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of   $126.02   per share of common stock), subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes.  

Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to January 1, 2019 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to   130%   of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the   five   business day period after any   five   consecutive trading day period (the  measurement period ) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than   98%   of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s     common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after January 1, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.

The price of the Company s common stock was greater than 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016. Therefore, as of September 30, 2016, the conversion threshold had been met and the Notes became convertible at the holders  option beginning on October 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2016. The determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible must continue to be performed on a quarterly basis. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, at the Company s election. The intention of the Company is to share-settle the total amount due upon conversion of the Notes. 

As of the date of issuance of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, none of the holders had requested conversion of th  e Notes. 

The total estimated fair value of the Notes was     $511.9   million     and     $364.  7 million     as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per   $100   of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the period. The Company considered the fair value of the Notes as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015     to be a Level 2 measurement.   The fair value of the Notes is primarily affected by the trading price of our common stock and market interest rates.     Based on the $  185.0   closing price of   the Company s   common stock on September 30, 2016, the if-converted value of   the   Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately   $154.4   million  .

10.   Cash Dividend Distribution 

In each of February, April, July and November of 2015, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of     $4,548     thousands (or     $0.103     per share on our outstanding shares of common stock). The dividends were paid on     April 16  ,   July 16  ,     October 16, 2015     and     January 15, 2016     to stockholders of record as of the close of business on     March 31  ,    June 30  ,   September 30  , and     December 31, 2015  . 

On   February 19, 2016  ,    May 4, 2016   and   August 2, 2016  , the Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of     $6,624     thousands (or     $0.150     per share) on our     outstanding     shares of common stock. The first quarterly dividend was paid on     April 15, 2016     to stockholders of record as of the close of business on     March 31, 2016  .   The second quarterly dividend   was paid   on     July 15, 2016     to stockholders   of record as of the close of business on     June 30, 2016  .     The third quarterly   dividend   was paid     on     October   14, 2016     to stockholders of record as of the close of business on     September 30, 2016  . 

On November 1, 2016, the Board of Directors approved   a quarterly cash dividend of     $6,624     thousands (or     $0.150     per share) on our     outstanding     shares of common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on     January   16, 201  7     to stockholders of record as of the close of business on     December 31  , 2016  . 

11.   New Law of  Costs, Earnings, and Fair Profits  

In November 2013 the Venezuelan Congress approved an  enabling law  granting the president of Venezuela the authority to enact laws and regulations in certain policy areas by decree. This authority includes the ability to restrict profit margins and impose greater controls on foreign exchange and the production, import, and distribution of certain goods. Among other actions, the president has used this decree power to pass the Law of Costs, Earnings, and Fair Profits, which became effective in January 2014 and, among other provisions, authorizes the Venezuelan government to set  fair prices  and maximum profit margins in the private sector. On October 26, 2015, the decree number 2,074 was published in the Official Gazette of Venezuela, establishing certain definitions related to the determination of prices in that country.  

Despite the Company does not expect that this law together with the decree issued by the Venezuelan Government will have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations, considering the current difficult macroeconomic environment in Venezuela, the final potential effects remains uncertain. The effects of such potential effects, if any, would be recognized in the financial statements once the mentioned uncertainty is resolved.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

Any statements     made or implied     in this report that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27     A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended,     and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and should be evaluated as such.   The words  anticipate,   believe,   expect,   intend,   plan,   estimate,   target,   p  roject,   should,   may,   could,   will  and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally relate to information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, industry environment, potential growth opportunities,   future economic, political and social conditions in the countries in which we operate   the effects of future regulation and the effects of competition. Such forward-looking statements reflect, among other things, our current expectations, plans, projections and strategies, anticipated financial results, future events and financial trends affecting our business, all of which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors (in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report) that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.   These risks and uncertainties include, among other things: 

our expectations regarding the continued growth of online commerce and Internet usage in Latin America;     

our ability to expand our operations and adapt to rapidly changing technologies;     

government   and central bank regulations;     

litigation   and legal liability;     

systems   interruptions or failures;     

our   ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;     

consumer   trends;     

security   breaches and illegal uses of our services;     

competition  ;     

reliance   on third-party service providers;     

enforcement   of intellectual property rights;     

our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and increase revenues;     

seasonal   fluctuations; and     

political, social and economic conditions in Latin America in general, and Venezuela and Argentina in particular, including Venezuela s status as a highly inflationary economy for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ), and possible future currency devaluation and other changes to its exchange rate systems such as the  Sistema Marginal de Divisas  ( SIMADI ) or  Sistema Cambiario de Divisas Complementarias  ( DICOM ) and possible further devaluations of the Argentine Peso.     

Many of these risks are beyond our ability to control or predict. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our company s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements  . 

These statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. While we believe that our assumptions, expectations and projections are reasonable in view of the currently available information, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. They are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control-as well as potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections.     Some of the material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections are described in  Item 1A   Risk Factors  in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015     filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission     ( SEC )     on     February 26     , 2016, as updated by those described in  Item 1A   Risk Factors  in Part II of our Form  s   10-Q for the quarter  s   ended March 31, 2016   and June 30, 2016  ,     and this report and in other reports we file from time to time with the SEC.

Business Overview 

MercadoLibre, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries  us ,  we ,  our  or the  Company ) hosts the largest online commerce platform in Latin America, which is focused on enabling e-commerce and its related services. Our platforms are designed to provide our users with a complete portfolio of services facilitating e-commerce transactions.   Additionally, we   are market leaders in e-commerce in each of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, based on unique visitors and page views. We also operate online commerce platforms in the Dominican Republic,   Honduras, Nicaragua, Salvador,   Panama  ,     Bolivia, Guatemala, Paraguay and Portugal. 

Through our online commerce platform, we provide buyers and sellers with a robust online commerce environment that fosters the development of a large and growing e-commerce community in Latin America, a region with a population of over 605 million people and one of the fastest-growing Internet penetration rates in the world. We believe that we offer a technological and commercial solution that addresses the distinctive cultural and geographic challenges of operating an online commerce platform in Latin America  . 

We offer our users an eco-system of six related e-commerce services: the MercadoLibre Marketplace, the MercadoLibre Classifieds service, the MercadoPago payments solution, the MercadoLibre Advertising program     ( MercadoClics ), the MercadoShops online webstores solution and the MercadoEnvios shipping service  . 

The MercadoLibre Marketplace, which we sometimes refer to as our Marketplace, is a fully-automated, topically-arranged and user-friendly online commerce service. This service permits both businesses and individuals to list general merchandising items and conduct their sales and purchases online in either a fixed-price or auction-based format. Any Internet user in the countries in which we operate can browse through the various products that are listed on our website and register with MercadoLibre to list, bid for and purchase such items and services  . 

To complement     the     MercadoLibre Marketplace, we     developed     MercadoPago, an integrated online payments solution.     MercadoPago is     designed to facilitate transactions both on and off the MercadoLibre Marketplace by providing a mechanism that allows our users to securely  ,     easily and promptly send, receive and finance payments online.   MercadoPago is currently available in: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Chile. 

Through   MercadoLibre Classifieds service, our   online classified listings service, our users can offer for sale and generate leads on listings of motor vehicles  , real estate and services in all counties where we operate. 

As a further enhancement to the MercadoLibre Marketplace, we developed our MercadoLibre Advertising program to enable businesses to promote their products and services through a cost efficient and automated platform that   allows   advertisers to acquire traffic  ,    both to our platform or to their own websites. Through MercadoLibre Advertising, MercadoLibre`s sellers and large advertisers/brands are able to place display, product and/or text ads on our web pages,   and   other web pages including   our   vertical sites associated in the region.

Additionally,     through   MercadoShops, our online webstores solution, users can set-up, manage and promote their own online webstores. These webstores are hosted by MercadoLibre and offer integration with the     other     marketplace, payments and advertising services we offer. Users can choose from a basic, free webstore or pay monthly subscriptions for enhanced functionality and value added services on their webstores. 

To further enhance our suite of e-commerce services, during 2013 and 2014, we launched the MercadoEnvios shipping solution in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Chile. Through MercadoEnvios, we offer a     cost-efficient integration with existing     logistic and     shipping carriers to sellers on our platform. Sellers opting into the program are able to offer a uniform and seamlessly integrated shipping experience to their buyers     at competitive prices  . 

In addition  , MercadoLibre     began developing and selling   enterprise software solutions to     e-commerce business clients in Brazil     during the second quarter of 2015.    

Reporting Segments and Geographic   I  nformation 

Our segment reporting is based on geography, which is the current criterion we are using to evaluate our segment performance. Our geographic segments include Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico and other countries (including Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Bolivia,   Honduras, Nicaragua, Salvador,   Guatemala, Paraguay, Uruguay and the United States of America (real estate classifieds in the State of Florida only)).     Although we discuss long-term trends in our business, it is our policy to not provide earnings guidance in the traditional sense. We believe that uncertain conditions make the forecasting of near-term results difficult. Further, we seek to make decisions focused primarily on the long-term welfare of our company and believe focusing on short term earnings does not best serve the interests of our stockholders. We believe that execution of key strategic initiatives as well as our expectations for long-term growth in our markets will best create stockholder value. We, therefore, encourage potential investors to consider this strategy before making an investment in our common stock. A long-term focus may make it more difficult for industry analysts and the market to evaluate the value of our company, which could reduce the value of our common stock of permit competitors with short term tactics to grow stronger than us. 

The following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues by segment for th  e nine and three  -month periods ended   September   3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  :

Office building acquisition agreement in Buenos Aires 

In August 2016, our Argentine subsidiary acquired 6,057 square meters and 50 parking spaces, in an office building in process of construction located in Buenos Aires, for a total amount of Argentine pesos $481  .4 million or approximately $31.4   million, plus VAT. The price of the transactio  n is payable as follows: i) $9.4   million was paid at the date of signing the purchase agreement and recorded as an advance for fixed assets within non-current Other assets, ii) $19.0 million will be paid in 14 monthly installments as from July 2017, and (iii) 3.0 million will be paid once the properties are delivered by the seller. According to the purchase agreement, 2,224 square meters will be delivered in September 2017 and 3,833 square meters will be delivered in September 2018.     In connection with this acquisition, the Company may be granted with certain sales tax reliefs upon receiving definitive approval of the project from the City of Buenos Aires government. 

Description of Line Items 

Net revenues 

We recognize revenues in each of our five geographical reporting segments.   Within each of our segments, the services we provide generally fall into two distinct revenue streams,  Marketplace  which includes our core business and  Non-Marketplace  which includes ad sales, real estate listings, motor   vehicles   listings, financing fees, off-platform payment fees  , shipping fees   and other ancillary businesses. 

The following table summarizes our consolidated net revenues   by revenue stream for the nine and three  -month periods ended   September   3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  :

(*)   The table above may not total due to rounding. 

(**)   Includes, among other things, ad sales, real estate listings, motor vehicles listings, financing fees, off-platform payment fees, shipping fees and other ancillary services  . 

Revenues from Marketplace transactions are generated from: 

final   value   fees; and     

up-front   fees  .     

For Marketplace services, final value fees representing a percentage of the sale value that are charged to the seller once the item is successfully sold. Up-front fees are charged to the seller in exchange for improved exposure of the listings throughout our platform and are not subject to the successful sale of the items listed. 

Revenues for Non-Marketplace services are generated from: 

financing   fees;     

off-  platform   payment fees;     

motor vehicles listings up-front fees;     

ad   sales   up-front fees;     

real   estate   listings up-front fees;     

shipping fees; and     

fees   from other ancillary businesses.     

With respect to our MercadoPago service, we generate payment related revenues attributable to: 

commissions representing a percentage of the payment volume processed that are charged to sellers in connection with   Non  -Marketplace-platform transactions;      

commissions   from   additional fees we charge   when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our MercadoPago platform, for transactions that occur either on or off our   Marketplace platform; and     

revenues related to sale of points of sale.     

Although we also process payments on   the   Marketplace, we do not charge sellers an added commission for this service, as it is already included in the Marketplace final value fee   we charge  . 

Through our classifieds offerings in motor vehicles, real estate and services, we generate revenues from up-front fees. These fees are charged to sellers who opt to give their listings greater exposure throughout our websites  . 

Our Advertising revenues are generated by selling either display   product and/  or t  ext link ads throughout our web  site  s   to interested advertisers. 

Finally, our shipping revenues are generated when a buyer elects to receive the item through our shipping service.  

When more than one service is included in one single arrangement with the customer, we recognize revenue according to multiple element arrangements accounting, distinguishing between each of the services provided and allocating revenues based on their respective   estimated   selling prices. 

We have a highly fragmented customer revenue base given the large numbers of sellers and buyers who   use our platforms. For the nine  -month periods ended   September 30  , 201  6   and 201  5  , no single customer accounted for more than 5.0% of our net revenues.  

Our MercadoLibre Marketplace is available in   19   countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bolivia,   Honduras, Nicaragua, Salvador,   Guatemala   and Paraguay  ), and MercadoPago is available in   seven   countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile,   Peru,   Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela).   Additionally, MercadoEnvios is available in   Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Chile.   The functional currency for each country s operations is the country s local currency, except for Venezuela where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to Venezuela s status as   a highly inflationary economy.   Therefore, our net revenues are generated in multiple foreign currencies and then

Our subsidiaries in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia are subject to certain taxes on revenues which are classified as a cost of net revenues.    T  hese taxes represented   9.0  % and   9.5  % of net revenues for the     nine and     three-month periods ended     September 30, 2016, as compared to 8.0% and 8.7%, respectively,     for the same respective periods in     2015,   mainly due to an increase in shipping and finance cost which are   accounted for net of its costs   in net revenues.    

Cost of net revenues 

Cost of net revenues primarily represents bank and credit card processing charges for transactions and fees paid with credit cards and other payment methods, fraud prevention fees, certain taxes on revenues, compensation for customer support personnel, ISP connectivity charges, depreciation and amortization and hosting, website operation fees and cost of point of sales ( MPOS ) sold  . 

Product and technology development expenses 

Our product and technology development related expenses consist primarily of compensation for our engineering and web-development staff, depreciation and amortization costs related to product and technology development, telecommunications costs and payments to third-party suppliers who provide technology maintenance services to us  . 

Sales and marketing expenses 

Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing costs for our platforms through online and offline advertising, bad debt charges, chargebacks related to our MercadoPago operations,   changes related to our buyer protection programs,   compensation of employees involved in these activities, public relations costs, marketing activities for our users and depreciation and amortization costs  . 

We carry out the majority of our marketing efforts on the Internet. In that regard, we enter into agreements with portals, search engines, social networks, ad networks and other websites in order to attract Internet users to the Marketplace and convert them into confirmed registered users and active traders on our platform.  

We also work intensively on attracting, developing and growing our seller community through our customer support efforts for sellers. We have dedicated professionals in most of our operations that work with sellers through trade show participation, seminars and meetings to provide them with important tools and skills to become effective sellers on our platform  . 

General and administrative expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for management and administrative staff, compensation for our outside directors, long-term retention plan compensation, expenses for legal, accounting, audit and other professional services, insurance expenses, office space rental expenses, travel and business expenses, as well as depreciation and amortization costs. Our general and administrative expenses include the costs of the following areas: general management, finance, administration, accounting, legal and human resources  . 

Impairment of l  ong-  l  ived assets    

We review long-lived assets   (including non-current other assets)   for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. 

As explained in section  Foreign Currency Translation   Venezuelan Currency Status  below, the exchange markets in Venezuela have been unfavorable to us since December 2013. 

Considering these changes in facts and circumstances and the lower U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows expected from the Venezuelan business, and long  -lived assets expected use, we   concluded that certain real estate investments held in Caracas, Venezuela, should be impaired. As a consequence,   we   estimated the fair value of the impaired long-lived assets, and r  ecorded impairment losses of $13  .  7   million and   $16.2 million on June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2015  , respectively, by using the market approach and considering prices for similar assets. 

Other income (expenses), net 

Other income (expenses) consists primarily of interest income derived from our investments and cash equivalents, interest expense related to financial liabilities and foreign currency gains or losses  .

Table of Contents  

Income and asset tax 

We are subject to federal and state taxes in the United States, as well as foreign taxes in the multiple jurisdictions where we operate. Our tax obligations consist of current and deferred income taxes and asset taxes incurred in these jurisdictions. We account for income taxes following the liability method of accounting. A valuation allowance is recorded when, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized.     Therefore, our income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable, if any (given that in certain jurisdictions we still have net operating loss carry-forwards), plus the change in our deferred tax assets and liabilities during each period  . 

Critical   A  ccounting   P  olicies and   E  stimates 

The preparation of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with our audit committee and our board of directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our interim condensed con  solidated financial statements. 

There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies, management estimates or accounting policies   since   the year ended December 31, 201  5 and disclosed in the Form 10-K. See Item    Critical Accounting Policies   .    

Foreign Currency Translation 

All of our foreign operations (other than Venezuela since January 1, 2010, as described below) use the local currency as their functional currency. Accordingly, these operating foreign subsidiaries translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies to U.S. dollars using period/year-end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period  , unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of the transaction are used.   The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as part of other comprehensive income (loss), a component of equity. Gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in non-functional currencies are recognized in earnings. Net foreign currency exchange losses or gains are included in the consolidated statements of income under the caption  Foreign currency gains/ losses . 

Venezuelan Currency Status 

Pursuant to   U.S. GAAP, we have   classified our   Venezuelan operations as highly inflationary since   January   1, 2010, using   the   U.S. dollar as the functional currency for   purposes of reporting our financial statements. Therefore, no translation effect has been accounted for in other comprehensive income related to our Venezuelan operations.  

O  n Februa  ry   10, 2015, the Venezuelan government issued a decree that unified the two previous foreign exchange systems  SICAD 1 and SICAD 2  into a new single system   (  SICAD  )  , with an initial public foreign exchange     rate     of   12   BsF per U.S. dollar. The SICAD auction process remains available only to obtain foreign currency to pay for a limited list of goods considered to be of high priority by the Venezuelan government, which does not include those relating to the   our   business. In the same decree the Venezuelan government created the  Sistema Marginal de Divisas  ( SIMADI ), a new foreign exchange system that is separate from SICAD, which publishes a foreign exchange rate from the BCV on a daily basis. 

In light of the disappearance of SICAD 2, and we inability to gain access to U.S. dollars under SICAD, we started requesting and was granted U.S. dollars through SIMADI. As a result, we from that moment expected to settle its transactions through SIMADI   going forward   and concluded that the SIMADI exchange rate should be used to re-measure its bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities and to re-measure the revenues and expenses of the Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of March 31, 2015. In connection with this re-measurement, we reco  rded a foreign exchange loss of $20.4   million during the first quarter of 2015. 

Considering this change and the lower U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows then expected from the Venezuelan business, we reviewed   our   long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life for impairment and concluded that the carrying value of certain real estate investments in Venezuela as of March 31, 2015 would not be fully recoverable. As a result, we  

32   

Table of Contents  

recorded an impai  rment of long-lived assets of $   16.2 million on March 31, 2015. The carrying amount   was   adjusted to its estimated fair value as of March 31, 2015, by using the market approach, and considering prices for similar assets.  

On March 9, 2016 the   Central Bank of Venezuela (   BCV   )   issued the Exchange Agreement No.35, which   is effective since   March 10, 2016. The agreement established a  protected  exchange rate (     DIPRO     ) for certain transactions,   such as but not limited to:   imports of goods of the food and health sectors, as well as supplies associated with the production of said sectors; expenses relating to health treatments, sports, culture, scientific research, and other urgent matters defined by the exchange regulations. All foreign currency transactions not expressly provided in Exchange Agreement No.35 will be processed on the alternate foreign currency markets governed by the exchange regulations, at the floating supplementary market exchange rate (     DICOM     ).    

Additionally, the agreement established that the alternate foreign currency markets referred to in Exchange Agreement No.33 of February 10, 2015 (SIMADI) will continue to operate until replaced by others. As of the date of issuance of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the SIMADI has not been replaced and for that reason, we continued using SIMADI. From March 31, 2016 through June 30, 2016, the SIMADI exchange rate increased from 273 BsF per U.S. dollar to 628 BsF per U.S. dollar, a 130% increase in the exchange rate.   As a consequence of the local currency devaluation  , the Company recorded a foreign exchange loss of   $  4.9   million during the   second   quarter of 201  6  . 

Considering   the   significant devaluation and the lower U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows then expected from the Venezuelan business,   we   reviewed   our   long-lived assets (including non-current other assets), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life for impairment and concluded that the carrying value of certain real estate investments in Venezuela would not be fully recoverable. As a result, on June 30, 2016,   we   recorded an impairment   of offices and commercial property under construction included within non-current other assets   of $13.7 million. The carrying amount   of offices and commercial property under construction   was adjusted to its estimated fair value of approximately $12.5 million as of June 30, 201  6, by using the market approach   and considering prices for similar assets. 

As of   September 30  , 2016, monetary assets and liabilities in Bolivares Fuertes ( BsF ) were re-measured to the U.S. dollar using the SIMADI   closing exchange rate of 659   BsF per U.S. dollar. 

Until 2010 we were able to obtain U.S. dollars for any purpose, including dividend distributions, using alternative mechanisms other than through the Commission for the Administration of Foreign Exchange Control (CADIVI). Those U.S. dollars, obtained at a higher exchange rate than the one offered by CADIVI and held in balance at U.S. bank accounts of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, were used for dividend distributions from our Venezuelan subsidiaries. We have not distributed dividends from our Venezuelan subsidiaries since 2011  . 

The following table sets forth the assets, liabilities and net assets of the   our   Venezuelan subsidiaries, before intercompany eliminations of a net liability of   $  13.4 million and $24.6   million  , as of   September 30  , 201  6 and December   31, 201  5   and net revenues for the   nine-month periods ended September   3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  : 

As   of September 30, 2016, the net assets (before intercompany eliminations) of our Venezuelan subsidiaries amounted to approximately 10.0% of our consolidated net assets, and cash and investments of our Venezuelan subsidiaries held in local currency in Venezuela amounted to approximately 1.0%   of our consolidated cash and   investments. 

Our ability to obtain U.S. dollars in Venezuela is negatively affected by the exchange restrictions in Venezuela that are described above. If our access to U.S. dollars becomes widely available at a more unfavorable rate than the current SIMADI exchange rate (or if SIMADI exchange rate experiences significant devaluation in the future), and we decided to use that alternative mechanism  

33   

Table of Contents  

considering that exchange rate as the one applicable for re-measurement, our results of operations, earnings and value of our net assets in Venezuela would be negatively impacted, and we cannot assure that the impact would not be material  . In addition, our business and ability to obtain U.S. dollars in Venezuela would be negatively affected by any additional material devaluations or the imposition of significant additional and more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange by the Venezuelan government in the future. 

Despite the current difficult macroeconomic environment in Venezuela, we continue managing, through our Venezuelan subsidiaries, our investment in Venezuela. Despite the current operating, political and economic conditions and certain other factors in Venezuela, we currently plan to continue supporting our business in Venezuela in the long run  . 

In November 2013 the Venezuelan Congress approved an  enabling law  granting the president of Venezuela the authority to enact laws and regulations in certain policy areas by decree. This authority includes the ability to restrict profit margins and impose greater controls on foreign exchange and the production, import, and distribution of certain goods. Among other actions, the president has used this decree power to pass the Law of Costs, Earnings, and Fair Profits, which became effective in January 2014 and, among other provisions, authorizes the Venezuelan government to set  fair prices  and maximum profit margins in the private sector. On October 26, 2015, the decree number 2,074 was published in the Official Gazette of Venezuela, establishing certain definitions related to the determination of prices in that country. 

Despite we do not expect that this law together with the decree issued by the Venezuelan Government will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations, considering the current difficult macroeconomic environment in Venezuela, the final potential effects remains uncertain. The effects of such potential effects, if any, would be recognized in our financial statements once the mentioned uncertainty is resolved.  

Allowances for doubtful accounts and for chargebacks 

We are exposed to losses due to uncollectible accounts and credits to sellers. Allowances for these items represent our estimate of future losses based on our historical experience. The allowances for doubtful accounts and for chargebacks are recorded as charges to sales and marketing expenses. Historically, our actual losses have been consistent with our charges. However, future adverse changes to our historical experience for doubtful accounts and chargebacks could have a material impact on our future consolidated statements of income and cash flows  . 

We believe that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts and for chargebacks is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management to make assumptions about future collections and credit analysis. Our management s assumptions about future collections require significant judgment  .    

Legal contingencies 

In connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss and provided for such losses through charges to our condensed consolidated statement of income. These estimates are based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances and historical information related to actions filed against us at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events  . 

Impairment of long-lived assets 

We review long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For more information, see  Description of line items       Impairment of long-lived assets      above  .    

Convertible Senior Notes 

On June 30, 2014, we issued $330 million of 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the  Notes ). The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company, which pay interest in cash semi-annually, on January 1 and July 1, at a rate of 2.25% per annum. The Notes will mature on July 1, 2019 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Notes may be converted, under specific conditions, based on an initial conversion rate of 7.9353 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $126.02 per share of common stock), subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes. 

34   

Table of Contents  

Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to January 1, 2019 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to   130%   of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the   five   business day period after any   five   consecutive trading day period (the  measurement period ) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than   98%   of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s     common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after January 1, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.  

The price of the Company s common stock was greater than 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016. Therefore, as of September 30, 2016, the conversion threshold had been met and the Notes became convertible at the holders  option beginning on October 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2016. The determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible must continue to be performed on a quarterly basis. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash     and shares of the Company s common stock, at the Company s election. The intention of the Company is to share-settle the total amount due upon conversion of the Notes  . As of the date of issuance   of this report  , none of the holders had requ  ested conversion of the Notes. 

The convertible debt instrument within the scope of the cash conversion subsection was separated into debt and equity components at issuance and a fair value was assigned. The value assigned to the debt component was the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar debt without the conversion feature. As of June 30, 2014, we determined the fair value of the liability component of the Notes by reviewing market data that was available for senior, unsecured nonconvertible corporate bonds issued by comparable companies. The difference between the cash proceeds and this estimated fair value, represents the value assigned to the equity component and was recorded as a debt discount. The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest method from the origination date through its stated contractual maturity date. 

The initial debt component of the Notes was valued at $283.0 million, based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate market rate for a non-convertible debt at the date of issuance, which was determined to be 5.55%. The carrying value of the permanent equity component reported in additional paid-in-capital was initially valued at $47.0 million. This amount represents the total unamortized debt discount we recorded at the time of issuance of the Notes. The aggregate debt discount, including the transaction costs related to the debt component, is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Notes using the effective interest method using an interest rate of 6.1%. 

In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we paid $19.7 million to enter into capped call transactions with respect to shares of our common stock (the  Capped Call Transactions ), with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes in the event that the market price of our common stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions, initially set at $126.02 per share of common stock, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the Notes, and have a cap price of $155.78 per share of common stock     . 

The $19.7 million cost of the capped call transactions, which net of deferred income tax effect amounts to $12.8 million, is included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital in the stockholders  equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. 

For more   detailed   information in relation to the Notes and the Capped Call transactions, see           Results of operations for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016 compared to the nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2015 and the three-month period ended   September   30, 2016 as compared to the three-month period ended   September   30, 2015                Debt    and Note 9 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

Principal trends in results of operations 

Growth in net revenues  

Since our inception, we have consistently generated revenue growth from our Marketplace and Non-Marketplace streams, driven by the strong growth of our key operational met  rics. Our net revenues grew 24.9% in the nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Our successful items sold and total payment volume increased 4  1.3  % and 4  6.3%, respectively, in the nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Additionally, our number of confirmed registered users was   a 20.2  % higher as of   September   30, 2016 as compared to the number of confirmed registered users as of   September   30, 2015.   Furthermore, our GMV   increased   13.2% in the nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015  .   

Our net revenues grew 36.9  % in the   three  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Our successful items sold and t  otal payment volume increased 40.0  % and   52.7%, respectively, in the three  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Additionally, our number of confirmed registered users was a   20.2  % higher as of   September   30, 2016 as compared to the number of confirmed registered users as of   September   30, 2015.   Furthermore, our GMV   increased   10.8% in the three  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015  .   

36   

Table of Contents  

We believe that the growth in net revenues should continue in the future. However, despite this positive historical trend, current weak global macro-economic environment, coupled with devaluations of certain local currencies in Latin America versus the U.S. dollar, the effects of Venezuelan translations of local currencies into U.S. dollar, Venezuelan Government limits to prices and high interest rates in those countries, could cause   a     decline   year-to-year   of our   net revenues, particularly as measured in U.S. dollars.  

Gross profit margins  

During the past year, our business has experienced decreasing gross profit margins, as defined by total net revenues minus total cost of net revenues, as a percentage of net revenues. 

Our gross profit margins were   63.6  % and 6  7.8% for the nine  -month periods ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our gross profit margins were 63.1% and 66.3%, respectively.   The decrease in our gross profit margins resulted primarily from: 

(i) Higher penetration of our payments and shipping   solution into our Argentine, Brazilian and Mexican marketplaces. For the nine and three-month period ended September 30, 2016, total volume of payments on marketplace represented 66.4% and 74.5% of our total gross merchandise volume ( GMV ) (excluding motor vehicles, vessels, aircraft and real estate), respectively; as compared to 51.6% and 54.4 % for the nine and three-month period ended September 30, 2015  , respectively  . Additionally, for the   nine and three  -month period ended   September   30, 2016,   the   total number of items shipped through our shipping solution represented 4  6  .8%   and 48.5%   of our total number of successful items sold,   respectively;   as compared to 3  3  .  2  %    and 36.5%   for the   nine and three  -month period  s   ended   September   30, 2015  , respectively  . Transactions that include such services intrinsically incur incremental costs such as collection fees, which result in lower gross profit margins. In addition, our financing and shipping revenues are disclosed net of third party provider costs while sales taxes are paid on the gross amount of revenues, thus, decreasing our gross profit margins. Fo  r the nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016, collection fees and sales taxes increased $  26.0   million and $  15.3   million, resp  ectively, as compared to the nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2015.     For the   three  -month period ended   September   30, 2016, collection fees and sales taxes increased $  11.3   million and $  7.2   million, respectively, as compared to the   same period in 2015. 

(ii) Increased customer support costs of   $10.7   million   and   $  5  .8   million   for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared in each case   with the same period in 2015; mainly as a consequence of salaries and wages. The number of employees related to customer support were 1,740 as of     September   30, 2016 as compared with   1,375   as of   September   30, 2015. 

In the future, gross profit margins could decline if the penetration of our payment solution and shipping grows faster than our marketplace. 

Operating income margins 

For the   nine-month period ended September 30, 2016     as compared to the   same period in 2015,     our operating income margin decreased from     22.4  % to   19.8  %  ,    as a consequence of increases in costs of net revenues, as described in Gross profit margins section above,     increases in product   and technology   development   expenses (driven mainly salaries and wages and maintenance expenses)   and in sales and marketing   expenses     (driven mainly by portal deals and buyer protection program expenses  )  .     For the   three-month period ended September 30, 2016     as compared to the   same period in 2015,     our operating income margin decreased from     26.8  % to   23.3  %  , as a consequence of   increases in costs of net revenues, as described in Gross profit margins section above,     increases in product   and technology   development   expenses (driven mainly salaries and wages and maintenance expenses),   in sales and marketing   (driven mainly by portal deals and buyer protection program expenses  ), and in general and administrative expenses (mainly driven by salaries and wages)  . 

We anticipate that as we continue to invest in   product development, sales,   marketing and human resources in order to promote our services and capture the long-term business opportunity offered by the Internet in Latin America, it is increasingly difficult to sustain growth in operating income margins, and at some point we could continue experiencing decreases in operating income margins.

The following table sets forth the growth in net revenues in local currencies for the nine and three-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015: 

(*)   The   local   currency revenue growth was calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 201  5   and applying them to the corresponding months in 201  6  , so as to calculate what our financial results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. 

In Venezuela, the increase in our net revenues is mainly due to higher average selling prices pos  ted by sellers during the nine and three-month period   ended   September 30  , 201  6  , which we do not control. The increase in average selling prices is a consequence of: (i)   high   inflation rate in that country; (ii) a shortage of products in Venezuela and (iii) changes in the mix of categ  ories of the items sold in our M  arketplace. 

In the case of Argentina, the increase in     our net revenues is due to an increase in the Argentine successful items volume during the nine and   three-month period   ended   September 30  ,   2016  . Additionally  ,   the increase     in     our net revenues     is     a consequence of     an increase in     shipped items     volume and increases in     our     MercadoPago     transactions. 

In Brazil, the significant increase in local currency growth, as compared to U.S. dollar growth, is a consequence of an increase of our Brazilian Marketplace volume and our shipped items volume and increases in     our     MercadoPago transactions.

For the     nine  -month period ended   September 30  , 2016  , the $  9.4     million     increase in other income   (expense)  , net when compared to the same period in 201  5   was     primarily attributable to:   i) a $10.5   million increase in interest income   arising from our financial investments in Brazil and Argentina; and   i  i  ) a   decrease     in foreign exchange loss   of $  1.6   million  ,     from $6.6 million in 2015 to $5.1 million in 2016.   The 2015 foreign exchange l  oss was a consequence of a $20.7   million foreign   exchange loss in Venezuela as a   result of start using the SIMADI exchange rate since March 31, 2015, partially offset by a     foreign exchange gain of     $  14.5   million   arising from the Reais revaluation over our U.S. Dollar net liability position in Brazil  .     The 2016 foreign exchange loss was a consequence of a $7.4 million loss arising from the U.S. Dollar revaluation over our Bolivares Fuertes net asset position in Venezuela and a $3.7 million loss arising from the Mexican Peso devaluation over our U.S. Dollar net liability position in Mexico, partially offset by a $6.5 million gain arising from the Argentine Peso devaluation over our U.S. Dollar net asset position in Argentina and a $0.8 million gain arising from the Reais revaluation over our U.S. Dollar net liability position in Brazil. These increases were   partially offset by    a    $  2  .  6   million increase in interest expens  e due mainly to the mortgage loan entered into in the third quarter of 2015 for the acquisition of real estate in Venezuela  ,     and other financial charges in Brazil  .

Income and asset tax 

(*) Percentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table. The table above may not total due to rounding. 

During the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015, income and asset tax increased by $2.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively, mainly as a consequence of: i) an increase in our pre-tax gains mainly in our Argentine and Brazilian subsidiaries; and ii) the tax holiday granted to our Argentine subsidiary related to the new software development law recorded in the third   quarter of 2015   that was proportionally higher than the tax holiday granted in 2016, as it   included a retroactive application from September 18, 2014. 

As a result of the application of this tax benefit, we recorded an income tax benefit   of $16  .0 million and   $6.8   million for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Furthermore, the Company recorded a labor cost benefit of   $4.2 million and $2.2 million for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Additionally, $1.4 million and $0.6   million were accrued to pay software development law audit fees during the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.     During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit of $  16.0   million, a labor cost benefit of $  4.2   million and $  1.4   million were accrued to pay software development law audit fees.   Labor cost benefits and software development law audit fees are not included within  Income and asset tax  line item. 

Our blended tax rate is defined as income and asset tax expense as a percentage of income before income and asset tax. Our effective income tax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes (net of charges related to dividend distributions from foreign subsidiaries that are offset with domestic foreign tax credits) as a percentage of income before income and asset tax. The effective income tax rate excludes the effects of the deferred income tax, and the assets and complementary income tax. 

The following table summarizes our blended and effective tax rates for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our blended and effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased as compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to   the one-time loss     recorded in our Venezuelan subsidiaries during the first quarter of 2015 related to the impairment of long-lived assets (which is not deductible for tax purposes) and the devaluation of the BsF net asset position. The 2015 effect was higher to the one-time loss recorded in the second quarter of 2016 and for that reason our blended and effective tax rate decreased. 

Our blended and effective tax rate for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 increased as compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to   the   tax holiday granted to our Argentine subsidiary related to the new software development law recorded in the third   quarter of 2015  ,    which was   proportionally higher than the tax holiday granted in 2016, as it   included a retroactive application from September 18, 2014. 

The following table sets forth our effective income tax rate related to our main segments for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

The increase in the effective income tax rate in our Argentine subsidiaries during the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015, is due to the tax holiday granted during third quarter of 2015 to our Argentine subsidiary related to the new software development law,   which was   higher to the tax holiday recorded in   the third quarter of 2016  , as it   included a retroactive application from September 18, 2014.  . 

On August 17, 2011, the Argentine government issued a new software development law and on September 9, 2013     a    regulatory decree was issued, which established the new requirements to become     a    beneficiary of the new software development law. The new decree establishes compliance requirements with annual incremental ratios related to exports of services and research and development expenses that must be achieved to remain within the tax holiday. The Argentine operation will have to achieve certain required ratios annually under the new software development law. During May 2014, we presented all the required documentation in order to apply for the new software development law.  

On September 17, 2015, the Argentine Industry Secretary issued Resolution 1041/2015 approving the Company s application for eligibility under the new software development law   for the Company s Argentinean subsidiary, Mercadolibre S.R.L. Furthermore, on September 18, 2016,   the Argentine Industry Secretary issued Resolution  s     93/2016 and 97/2016   approving the Company s application for eligibility under the new software development law   for the Company s Argentinean subsidiaries, Neosur S.RL. and Business Vision S.A.   As a result, the Company s Argentinean   subsidiaries have   been granted a tax holiday retro  active from September 18, 2014 for its software developments activities. A portion of the benefits available to beneficiaries of the new law is a relief of 60% of total income tax related to software development activities and a 70% relief in payroll taxes related to software development activities. 

The decrease in our Brazilian effective income tax rate for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015, was mainly related to temporary differences deducted in the current period. 

The   increase   in our Mexican   effective income tax rate for   the   nine-  month period ended   September   30, 2016 as compared with the same period in 2015, is due to the   higher   pre-tax loss  es   recorded during 201  6 as   a result of the devaluation in that country. The foreign exchange loss is a consequence of U.S. dollars liabilities assumed to acquire an online classified business. The   decrease   in our Mexican   effective income tax rate for   the   three-  month period ended   September   30, 2016 as compared with the same period in 2015  , is due to the use of previous tax loss carryforwards during the third quarter of 2015. 

For the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our Venezuelan effective income tax rate was driven by losses recorded in our Venezuelan subsidiaries related to the impairment of long-lived assets and foreign exchange losses, which generated a net loss before income tax. The impairment of long-lived assets charge is non-deductible for tax purposes. The main difference year over year is that in the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016, the loss carryforward generated by the devaluation of the local currency was considered not recoverable for tax purposes, while in 2015 it was considered recoverable and for that reason we record a deferred tax asset. 

We do not expect the domestic effective income tax rate related to dividend distributions from foreign subsidiaries to have a significant impact on our company since our strategy is to reinvest our cash surplus in our international operations, and to distribute dividends when they can be offset with available tax credits  .

Brazil 

For the nine  -month period ended   September 30  , 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015  , direct costs increased by 48.2%, mainly driven by: i) a 61.7  % increase in cost of net revenues, mainly attributable to an increase in collection fees as a consequence of higher penetration of     our   MercadoPago   business  , sales tax costs   an  d salaries and wages; ii) a 75.7  % increase in product and technology development expenses, mainly due to an increase in salaries and wages   and   higher deprecia  tion and amortization expenses; iii) a 32.8  % increase in sales and marketing expenses, mainly due to an increase in buyer protection program expenses, online marketing expenses  , salaries and wages   and other marketing expenses  ; and iv) a   14.2  % increase in general and administrative expenses.

During first quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016, we recorded an impairment of long-lived assets of $16.2 million and $13.7 million respectively in our Venezuelan subsidiaries. 

F  or the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 201  5  , direct costs increased by   20.9  %, mainly driven by:   i)   a    30.7% in  crease in sales and marketing expenses that was mainly attributable to a  n     increase   in bad debt   expenses   and chargeback   expenses  ;   ii)   a    14.5  % increase in cost of net revenues that was mainly attributable to an increase in customer support costs   and certain new taxes on payment business; and ii  i) a   423.7  %    in  crease in product and technology development expenses attributable to a  n     increase in   depreciation and amortization expenses  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our main cash requirement historically has been working capital to fund MercadoPago financing operations in Brazil. We also require cash for capital expenditures relating to technology infrastructure, software applications, office space,     business acquisitions, to fund the payment of quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock and to fund the   interest   payments on our Convertible Notes. 

Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through contributions received from our stockholders during the first two years of operations, from funds raised during our initial public offering, and from cash generated from our operations.   W  e issued on June 30, 2014, $330 million principal balance of Convertible Notes for net proceeds to us of approximately $321.7 million. We have funded MercadoPago   mainly   by discounting credit card receivables and through cash advances derived from our business. 

As of September 30  , 201  6  , our main source of liquidity, amounting to $  471.6   million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and $  155.2   million of long-term investments  ,     was   provided by cash generated from operations and from the issuance of the Convertible Notes. We   consider our long-term investments as part of our liquidity because long-term investments are comprised of available-for-sale securities classified as long-term as a consequence of their contractual maturities. 

The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, funds receivable from and payable to MercadoPago users, and short-term debt. As long as we continue transferring credit card receivables to financial institutions in return for cash, we will continue generating cash.

Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016   cash and investments of foreign subsidiaries amounted to $  343.5   million, or   54.8  % of our consolidated cash and investments, and approximately   41.7  % of our consolidated cash and investments were held outside the U.S., mostly in Brazil and Argentina. Our strategy is to reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign operations in those operations and to distribute dividends when they can be offset with available tax credits. We do not expect a material impact in any repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries on our operations since the taxable domestic gains generated by any dividend distributions will be mostly offset with foreign tax credits that arise from income tax paid in our foreign operations, which we are allowed to compute for domestic income tax purposes. 

In the event we change the way we manage our business, our working capital needs could be funded, as we did in the past, through a combination of the sale of credit card coupons to financial institutions and cash advances from our business. 

The following table presents our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the   nine  -month periods ended   September   3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  :

(*) Percentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table. The table above may not total due to rounding. 

The $  36.4   million   increase   in net cash provided by operating activities during the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily driven by a   $47.7   million   decrease   in accounts receivables  , a $29.5 million decrease in credit card receivables     and a $18.2 million increase in our net income  ; which was partially offset by a $  53.0   million decrease in accounts   payables and accrued expenses. 

Net cash   used in   investing activities 

(*) Percentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table. The table above may not total due to rounding. 

Net cash   used in   investin  g activities in the nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 resulted mainly from purchases of investments of $  2,548  .1 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments of $  2,525.1   million, as part of our financial strategy. We used $  55.6   million in the purchase of property plant and equipment (mainly in our Argentine and Brazilian offices and in information technology in Argentina and Brazil), $7.3 million to fund the acquisitions of Monits S.A. and Axado, and $  6.1   million in advances for property and equipment.

Net cash used in financing activities 

(*) Percentages have been calculated using whole-dollar amounts rather than rounded amounts that appear in the table. The table above may not total due to rounding. 

For the nine-month period ended   September   30, 2016, our primary use of cash was to fund $1  7.8   million in cash di  vidends and $6.5   million for the payments on loans payable and other financing.   In addition, we generated $3.9 million proceeds from our loans payable and other financial liabilities. 

In the event that we decide to pursue strategic acquisitions in the future, we may   fund them with available cash, third  -  party debt financing, or by raising equity capital, as market conditions allow. 

Debt 

On June 30, 2014, we issued $330 million of 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the  Notes ). The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of our Company, which pay interest in cash semi-annually, on January 1 and July 1, at a rate of 2.25% per annum. The Notes will mature on July 1, 2019 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Notes may be converted, under the conditions specified below, based on an initial conversion rate of 7.9353 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $126.02 per share of common stock), subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes. 

Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to January 1, 2019 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2014 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the  measurement period ) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after January 1, 2019 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.  

The price of our common stock was greater than 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016. Therefore, as of September 30, 2016, the conversion threshold had been met and the Notes became convertible at the holders  option beginning on October 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2016. The determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible must continue to be performed on a quarterly basis.  

As of the date of issuance of   this report  , none of the holders had requ  ested conversion of the Notes. 

The total estimated fair value of the Notes was     $511.9   million     and     $364.  7 million     as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per   $100   of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the period.   Based on the $  185.0   closing price of   the Company s   common stock on September 30, 2016, the if-converted value of   the   Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately   $154.4   million  . 

Capped     C  all   T  ransactions 

The net proceeds from the Notes were approximately $321.7 million after considering the transaction costs in an amount of $8.3 million. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we paid approximately $19.7 million to enter into capped call transactions with respect to its common stock (the  Capped Call Transactions ), with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes in the event that the market price of our common stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions, initially set at $126.02 per common share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the Notes, and have a cap price of approximately $155.  78   per common share. Therefore, as a result  

50   

Table of Contents  

of executing the Capped Call Transactions, we will reduce our exposure to potential dilution once the market price of its common shares exceeds the strike price of $126.02 and up to a ca  p price of approximately $155.78   per common share. The Capped Call Transactions allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the Notes upon conversion, up to the above mentioned cap price. 

Office building acquisition agreement  s   in Caracas 

During the third quarter of 2015, we obtained (through our     Venezuelan     subsidiary) a mortgage loan from Banco del Caribe, C.A. Banco Universal to fund a portion of the acquisition of five offices under construction in Caracas, Venezuela  ,    of BsF $1,000 million     to be paid in monthly installments over five     years and which bears a fixed interest rate of 24% per annum.     The mortgage was constituted over the offices acquired up to an amount of BsF $2,000 million to cover the   amo  unts due to the bank. As of September   30, 2016, the amount due in relation to the mentioned   mortgage loan amounts to BsF $793   million, or $  1   million.    

Cash Dividends 

In each of February, April, July and November of 2015, our   b  oard of   d  irectors declared quarterly cash dividends of     $4  .5     million   (or     $0.103     per share on our outstanding shares of common stock). The dividends were paid on     April 16, July 16,     October 16, 2015     and     January 15, 2016     to stockholders of record as of the close of business on     March 31, June 30, September 30, and     December 31, 2015  , respectively  . 

On February 19, 2016,   May 4, 2016 and August 2, 2016, our   board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of     $6.  6   million   (or     $0.150     per share) on our     outstanding     shares of common stock. The first quarterly dividend   was     paid   on     April 15, 2016     to stockholders of record as of the close of business on     March 31, 2016.     The second   quarterly   cash   dividend   was paid   on     July     15  , 2016     to stockholders of record as of the close of business on     June 30, 2016.   The third   quarterly   cash dividend was paid   on   October   14  , 2016     to stockholders of record as of the close of business on     September 30, 2016. 

On November 1, 2016,     our board of directors   approved a quarterly cash dividend of     $6,6 million   (or     $0.150     per share) on our     outstanding     shares of common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on   January   16, 201  7     to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   December 31  , 2016. 

We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, any future determination as to the declaration of dividends on our common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors, including the applicable requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law  .    

Capital expenditures 

Our capital expenditures (comprised by our payments for property and equipment, intangible assets and acquired business) for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015     amounted to $69.0 million and $83.4   million, respectively. 

During the nine  -month   period ended September 30, 2016 we invested $27.6 million in our Brazilian, Colombian and Argentinean offices, and $17.5 million in Information Technology in Argentina and Brazil. 

During 2015, our Venezuelan subsidiary acquired five offices under construction, in Caracas, Venezuela for a total purchase price of BsF $4,645.6 million, or $23.4 million, for investment purposes and included in non-current other assets. Our Venezuelan subsidiary paid the purchase price in BsF, and funded the transaction with funds from its own operations and with a mortgage loan amounting to BsF $1,000 million to be paid in monthly installments over five years, and included in current and non-current liabilities   under the caption  Loans payable and other financial liabilities . The offices   are expected to be completed   in   August 2017. 

During April 2016, our Venezuelan subsidiary acquired   commercial properties   in process of construction for a total of   135.81   square meters, in Caracas, Venezuela for a total purchase price of approximately   BF$1,359 million, or $3.7 million  , for investment purposes and included in non-current other assets. The Venezuelan subsidiary paid the purchase price in Bolivares Fuertes.   According to the purchase agreements, t  he   commercial properties   will be delivered   in September 2017  . 

On February 12, 2016, through   our   subsidiaries Meli Participaciones S.L. and Marketplace Investment LLC,     we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock     of Monits S.A., a software development company located a  nd organized under the laws of   Buenos Aires, Argentina  , for the purchase price of $3.1 million,   measured at its fair value.   We believe this acquisition will allow us to enhance our software development capabilities.

Table of Contents  

On June 1  , 2016, through   our   subs  idiary Ebazar.com.br Ltda., we   acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of   Axado,   a company that develops   logistic   software for the e-commerce industry in Brazil  , for the purchase price of $5.5 million,   measured at its fair value.   We believe this acquisition will allow us to enhance our software development capabilities on Transportation Management System and will contribute to our shipping business performance. 

In   August 2016, our Argentine subsidiary acquired 6,057 square meters and 50 parking spaces, in an office building in process of construction located in Buenos Aires, for a total amount of Argentine pesos $481  .4   million or approx  imately $31.4   million, plus VAT. The price of the transactio  n is payable as follows: i) $9.4   million was paid at the date of signing the purchase agreement and recorded as an advance for fixed assets within non-current Other assets, ii) $19.0 million will be paid in 14 monthly installments as from July 2017, and (iii) 3.0 million will be paid once the properties are delivered by the seller. According to the purchase agreement, 2,224 square meters will be delivered in September 2017 and 3,833 square meters will be delivered in September 2018.     In connection with this acquisition, the Company may be granted with certain sales tax reliefs upon receiving definitive approval of the project from the City of Buenos Aires government. 

We are permanently increasing the level of investment on hardware and software licenses necessary to improve and update the technology of our platform and cost of computer software developed internally. We anticipate continued investments in capital expenditures related to information technology in the future as we strive to maintain our position in the Latin American e-commerce market. 

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the sale of credit card receivables and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, property and equipment expenditures and to pay or repay obligations going forward. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

As of   September   30  , 201  6  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

On March 8, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-04.   When an entity sells a prepaid stored-value product (such as gift cards, telecommunication cards, and traveler s checks), it recognizes a financial liability for its obligation to provide the product holder with the ability to purchase goods or services at a third-party merchant. When a prepaid stored-value product goes unused wholly or   partially   for an indefinite time period, the amount that remains on the product is referred to as breakage. There currently is diversity in the methodology used to recognize breakage. Subtopic 405-20 includes derecognition guidance for both financial liabilities and nonfinancial liabilities, and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, includes authoritative breakage guidance but excludes financial liabilities.     The amendments in this Update provide a narrow scope exception to the guidance in Subtopic 405-20 to require that breakage be accounted for consistent with the breakage guidance in Topic 606.   The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on our financial statements. 

On March 14, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-06.   Topic 815 requires that embedded derivatives be separated from the host contract and accounted for separately as derivatives if certain criteria are met, including the  clearly and closely related  criterion. The amendments in this Update clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. The amendments apply to all entities that are issuers of or investors in debt instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt host) with embedded call (put) options.     The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on our financial statements  . 

On March 17, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-08.   This update releases Accountin  g Standards Update No. 2016-08 -   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). The amendments in this Update will clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.   The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on our financial statements. 

On March 30, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-09.   The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or  

52   

Table of Contents  

liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. In addition, the amendments in this Update eliminate the guidance in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment.     This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which has been deleted.   The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on our financial statements. 

On April 14, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-10.  This update releases Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. This Update clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in the new revenue recognition standard.     The Update includes targeted improvements based on input the Board received from the Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition and other stakeholders. The Update seeks to proactively address areas in which diversity in practice potentially could arise, as well as to reduce the cost and complexity of applying certain aspects of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basis  . The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on our financial statements. 

On May 3, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-11 on Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).  The amendments in this Update eliminate some guidance related to revenue recognition and derivatives.   The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on our financial statements. 

On May 9, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-12  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients . The amendments in this update address narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. Additionally, the amendments in this update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers.     The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on our financial statements. 

On June 16, 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-13  Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of credit losses on financial instruments . This update   amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities.     For assets held at amortized cost basis,   this update   eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect   it s   current estimate of all expected credit losses. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP, however   this topic   will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down.   The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are   assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on   our   financial statements  .  

On August 26, 2016 the FASB issued the    ASU 2016-15 Statement of cash flows (Topic 230): Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments   .   This   update   addresses the following e  ight specific cash flow issues: d  ebt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (COLIs) (including bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLIs)); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.     The new standard is effective for fiscal years     beginning after December 15, 201  7. We are   assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on   our   financial statements  .  

On October 24, 2016 the FASB issued the    ASU 2016-1  6     Income Taxes (Topic 740):   Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   . This update eliminates   the exception that prohibits recognizing current and deferred income tax consequences for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset or assets have been sold to an outside party. Consequently, this update   requires to   recognize the current and deferred income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer when the transfer occurs.   The new standard is effective for fiscal years     beginning after December 15, 201  7. We are   assessing the effects that the adoption of this accounting pronouncement may have on   our   financial statements  .  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with     U.S.   GAAP, we use free cash flows and foreign exchange     ( FX ) neutral measures,   adjusted net income before income / asset tax, adjusted income / asset tax, adjusted net income, adjusted blended tax rate and adjusted earnings per share     as non-GAAP measures. 

53   

Table of Contents  

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with     U.S.   GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with     U.S.   GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable     U.S.   GAAP financial measures. 

Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable     U.S.   GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables included in this quarterly report. 

Non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors  overall understanding of our current financial performance. Specifically, we believe that f  ree cash flow provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding payments f  or the acquisition of property and   equipment, of intangible assets     and of b  usinesses net of cash acquired,   that may not be indicative of our core operating results. In addition, we report free cash flows to investors because we believe that the inclusion of this measure provides consistency in our financial reporting. 

Free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less payment   and advances   for the acquisition of property   and   equipment   net of financial liabilities,   intangible assets     and acquired businesses net of cash acquired. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our operations after the purchases of property and equipment, of intangible assets and of acquired businesses net of cash acquired. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. 

The following table shows a   r  econciliation of Operating Cash Flows to Free Cash Flows  : 

(*) The table above may not total due to rounding. 

W  e believe   that     reconciliation of FX neutral measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.  

The   FX neutral measures were   calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 201  5   and applying them to the corresponding months in 201  6  ,     so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next.   The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations. 

The following table se  ts forth the FX neutral measures     related   to our reported   results of the   operations for the   nine and three-month   period  s ended September 30, 2016  :

Moreover, we believe that adjusted net income before income / asset tax, adjusted income / asset tax, adjusted net income, adjusted blended tax rate and adjusted earnings per share provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign exchange loss attributable to the devaluation in Venezuela and the impairment of long-lived assets, because it may not be indicative of the ordinary course of our business. In addition, we report adjusted net income before income / asset tax, adjusted income / asset tax, adjusted net income, adjusted blended tax rate and adjusted earnings per share to investors because we believe that the inclusion of these measures provides consistency in the Company s financial reporting and because these financial measures provide useful information to management and investors about what our adjusted net income before income / asset tax, adjusted income / asset tax, adjusted net income, adjusted blended tax rate and adjusted earnings per share, would have been, had the foreign exchange loss in Venezuela and the impairment of long-lived assets not occurred. A limitation of the utility of adjusted net income before income / asset tax, adjusted income / asset tax, adjusted net income, adjusted blended tax rate and adjusted earnings per share, as measures of financial performance, is that these measures do not represent the total foreign exchange effect in our Income Statement for the   nine and     three-month periods     ended   September     3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  :

It    em 3   Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk 

We are exposed to market risks arising from our business operations. These market risks arise m  ainly from the possibility that   changes in interest rates and the U.S. dollar exchange rate with local currencies, particularly the Brazilian   r  eal and Argentine   p  eso due to Brazil s and Argentine s respective share of our revenues, may affect the value of our financial assets and liabilities. 

Foreign currencies 

As of   September 30  , 201  6  , we hold cash and cash equivalents in local currencies in our subsidiaries, and have receivables denominated in local currencies in all of our operations. Our subsidiaries generate revenues and incur most of their expenses in   the respective   local currencies     of the countries in which they operate  . As a result, our subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency, except for our Venezuelan subsidiaries  ,   which use the U.S. dollar as if it is the functional currency due to Venezuela being a highly inflationary   environment  .    As of   September 30  , 201  6  , the total cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies totaled $  133.7   million, short-term investments denominated in foreign currencies totaled $  127.3   million and accounts receivable and credit cards receivables in   foreign currencies totaled $257.9   million. As of   September 30  , 201  6  , we had no long-term investments denominated in foreign currencies. To manage exchange rate risk, our treasury policy is to transfer most cash and   cash equivalents in excess of working capital requirements into U.S. dollar-denominated accounts in the United States. As of   September 30  , 201  6  , our U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $  210.6   million and our U.S. dollar-denominated l  ong-term investments totaled $155.2   million.  

For the   nine  -month period ended   September 30  , 201  6  ,   we had a consolidated loss on foreign currency of $5.1     million   primarily   as a result of a $7.4 million loss arising from the U.S. Dollar revaluation over our Bolivares Fuertes net asset position in Venezuela and a $3.7 million loss arising from the Mexican Peso devaluation over our U.S. Dollar net liability position in Mexico,

partially offset by a $6.5 million gain arising from the Argentine Peso devaluation over our U.S. Dollar net asset position in Argentina and a $0.8 million gain arising from the Reais revaluation over our U.S. Dollar net liability position in Brazil 

If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and net income while the re-measurement of our net asset position in U.S. dollars will have a negative impact in our Statement of Income. Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses and net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, while the re-measurement of our net asset position in U.S. dollars will have a positive impact in our Statement of Income. 

The following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net revenues by segment for the   nine and   three-month periods ended   September   3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  :

Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis 

The table below shows the impact on our net revenues, expenses, other expenses and income tax, net income and equity for a positive and a negative 10% fluctuation on all the foreign currencies to which we are exposed to for the   nine-month period   ended   September 30, 2016  :

The table above shows an increase in our net income w  hen the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies because the re-measurement of our net asset position in U.S. dollars has a lesser impact than the increase in our net revenues, operating expenses, and other expenses, net and income tax lines related to the translation effect. Similarly, the table above shows a decrease in our net income when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies because the re-measurement of our net asset position in U.S. dollars has a lesser impact than the decrease in our net revenues, operating expenses, and other expenses, net and income tax lines related to the translation effect.

Venezuelan Segment 

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have   classified   our Venezuelan operations   as   highly inflationary   since   January 1, 2010  ,   using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for   purposes of reporting our financial statements. Therefore, no translation effect has been accounted for in other comprehensive income related to our Venezuelan operations.   As of   September   3  0  , 201  6  , monetary assets and liabilities in BsF were re-measured to the U.S. dollar using the   SIMADI   closing exchange rate of   659   BsF per U.S. dollar  . 

The following table sets forth the assets, l  iabilities and net assets of our   Venezuelan subsidiaries, before intercompany eliminations of a net liability of   $  13.4   million   and $  24.6   million  , as of   September    3  0  , 201  6 and December   31, 201  5, respectively   and net revenues for the   nine  -month periods ended   September   3  0  , 201  6   and 201  5  : 

As of   September   3  0  , 201  6  , the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries amount  ed   to approximately   10  .  0% of our   consolidated net assets, and cash and investments of our Venezuelan subsidiaries held in local currency in Venez  uela amounted to approximately 1.0  % of our   consolidated cash and investments. 

O  n Februa  ry   10, 2015, the Venezuelan government issued a decree that unified the two previous foreign exchange systems  SICAD 1 and SICAD 2  into a new single system denominated SICAD, with an initial public foreign exchange     rate     of   12   BsF per U.S. dollar. The SICAD auction process remains available only to obtain foreign currency to pay for a limited list of goods considered to be of high priority by the Venezuelan government, which does not include those relating to the Company s business. In the same decree the Venezuelan government created the  Sistema Marginal de Divisas  ( SIMADI ), a new foreign exchange system that is separate from SICAD, which publishes a foreign exchange rate from the BCV on a daily basis. 

In light of the disappearance of SICAD 2, and we inability to gain access to U.S. dollars through the new single system under SICAD, we started requesting and was granted U.S. dollars through SIMADI. As a result, we from that moment expected to settle its transactions through SIMADI and concluded that the SIMADI exchange rate should be used to re-measure its bolivar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities and to re-measure the revenues and expenses of the Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of March 31, 2015. In connection with this re-measurement, we reco  rded a foreign exchange loss of $20.4   million during the first quarter of 2015. 

Considering this change in facts and circumstances and the lower U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows then expected from the Venezuelan business, we reviewed   our   long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life for impairment and concluded that the carrying value of certain real estate investments in Venezuela as of March 31, 2015 would not be fully recoverable. As a result, we recorded an impai  rment of long-lived assets of $   16.2 million on March 31, 2015. The carrying amount   was   adjusted to its estimated fair value as of March 31, 2015, by using the market approach, and conside  ring prices for similar assets.   As of September 30, 2016, the SIMADI exchange rate was   658.9     BsF per U.S. dollar  . 

On March 9, 2016 the   Central Bank of Venezuela (   BCV   )   issued the Exchange Agreement No.35, which   is effective as from   March 10, 2016. The agreement established a  protected  exchange rate (     DIPRO     ) for certain transactions,   such as but not limited to:   imports of goods of the food and health sectors, as well as supplies associated with the production of said sectors; expenses relating to health treatments, sports, culture, scientific research, and other urgent matters defined by the exchange regulations. All foreign currency transactions not expressly provided in Exchange Agreement No.35 will be processed on the alternate foreign currency markets governed by the exchange regulations, at the floating supplementary market exchange rate (     DICOM     ).     Additionally, the agreement established that the alternate foreign currency markets referred to in Exchange Agreement No.33 of February 10, 2015 (SIMADI) will continue to operate until replaced by others. As of the date of issuance of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the SIMADI has not been replaced and for that reason, we continued using SIMADI. From March 31, 2016 through June 30, 2016, the SIMADI exchange rate increased from 273 BsF per U.S. dollar to 628 BsF per U.S. dollar, a 130% increase in the exchange rate.     As a  

58

consequence of the local currency devaluation  , the Company recorded a foreign exchange loss of   $  4.9   million during the   second   quarter of 201  6  .    

Considering   the   significant devaluation and the lower U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows then expected from the Venezuelan business,   we   reviewed   our   long-lived assets (including non-current other assets), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life for impairment and concluded that the carrying value of certain real estate investments in Venezuela as of June 30, 2016 would not be fully recoverable. As a result, on June 30, 2016,   we   recorded an impairment   of offices under construction included within non-current other assets   of $13.7 million. The carrying amount   of offices under construction   was adjusted to its estimated fair value of approximately $12.5 million as of June 30, 2016, by using the market approach, and considering prices for similar assets. 

Until 2010 we were able to obtain U.S. dollars for any purpose, including dividend distributions, using alternative mechanisms other than through the Commission for the Administration of Foreign Exchange Control (CADIVI). Those U.S. dollars, obtained at a higher exchange rate than the one offered by CADIVI and held in balance at U.S. bank accounts of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, were used for dividend distributions from our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Our Venezuelan subsidiaries have not requested authorization since 2012 to acquire U.S. dollars to make dividend distributions and we have not distributed dividends from our Venezuelan subsidiaries since 2011  . 

Although the current mechanisms available to obtain U.S. dollars for dividend distributions to shareholders outside of Venezuela imply increased restrictions, we do not expect that the current restrictions to purchase U.S. dollars will have a significant adverse effect on our business     strategy   with regard to the investment in Venezuela. 

In order to assist investors in their overall understanding of the impact on our Venezuelan segment reporting, we developed a scenario that considers a 100  % additional devaluation over the SIMADI rate as of the date of this report, applied for the period starting on   January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016  .     These disclosures may help investors to project sensitivities, on segment information captions, to devaluations of whatever order of magnitude they choose by simple arithmetic calculations. The information is just a scenario and does not represent a forward-looking statement about our expectations or projections related to future events in Venezuela. The investors and other readers or users of the financial information presented in this caption are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this scenario. This information is not a guarantee of future events. 

The information disclosed below does not include any inflation effect, nor the devaluation impact related to the assumed devaluation or any other effect derived from the assumed devaluation  , such as further impairments of long-lived assets  . The information below should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with   U.S.   GAAP. In addition, this information is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. 

The evolution of the Venezuelan economy and any future governmental interventions in the Venezuelan economy are beyond our ability to control or predict. New events could happen in the future in Venezuela and it is not possible for management to predict all such events, nor can it assess the impact of all such events on our Venezuelan business. 

The table below provides specific sensitivity information of our Venezuelan segment reporting for the period indicated assuming   approximately a 100% additional devaluation over the SIMADI rate as of the date of this report, applied for the period starting on   January 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016  : 

(*) As reported. 

(**) Computing a hypothetical devaluation of the Venezuelan segment from January 1 to   September 30  , 2016   assuming an exchange rate of 1,317.77 BsF per U.S. dollar (100  % of the exchange rate as of   September 30  , 2016).

Despite the continued uncertainty and restrictions relating to foreign currency exchange in Venezuela as described above, we believe that our underlying business in that country is competitively well-positioned and continues to exhibit solid growth, in terms of units sold, even while economic conditions in the Venezuelan economy remain difficult. As economic conditions in that country improve, we expect that our business in Venezuela will benefit accordingly. Although during the first half of 2016, we experienced a strong devaluation of our business in Venezuela, we cannot assure you that the BsF will not experience further devaluations or that the Venezuelan government will not default on its obligations to creditors in the future, which may be significant and could have a material negative impact on our future financial results of our Venezuela segment and value of our bolivar denominated net assets. However, for the reasons stated at the beginning of this paragraph, we remain strongly committed to our business and investment in Venezuela. 

Argentine Segment 

During December 2015 the Argentine peso exchange rate increased by approximately 37% against the U.S. dollar, to 13.30 Argentine pesos per U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2015. Due to such increase in the Argentine peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, during the fourth quarter of 2015,   we   recognized a foreign exchange gain of $18.2 million     (as a result of having a net asset position in U.S. dollars)     and the reported Other Comprehensive Loss increased by $22.8     million (as a result of having a net asset position in Argentine pesos).     As of   September 30  , 2016  ,   the Argentine Peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was 1  5  .  3  .    

Had a hypothetical devaluation of 10% of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar occurred on September 30, 2016, the reported net assets in our Argentine subsidiaries would have decreased by approximately $11.8 million with a related impact on Other Comprehensive Income. Additionally, we would have recorded a foreign exchange gain amounting to approximately $4.4 million in our Argentine subsidiaries. 

Brazilian   Segment 

During     2015, the     Brazilian   real     exchange rate against the U.S. dollar increased in approximately     44  %, from     2.7     Brazilian Reais     per U.S.dollar as of December 31, 2014     to     3.90     Brazilian Reais     per U.S. dollar     as of December 31, 2015. Due to the abovementioned devaluation, during the           year ended December 31, 2015, the reported Other Comprehensive Loss of the Brazilian segment     increased     in     $9.0     million as a result of having a net asset position in Brazilian Reais; and   we   recognized a foreign exchange gain of     $14.6     million during the same period.     As of   September     30  , 2016  ,   the   Brazilian     Reais   exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was   3  .  2  . 

Had a hypothetical devaluation of 10% of the Brazilian Reais against the U.S. dollar occurred on September 30, 2016, the reported net assets in our Brazilian subsidiaries would have decreased by approximately $6.7 million with the related impact in Other Comprehensive Income. Additionally, we would have recorded a foreign exchange gain amounting to approximately $0.2 million in our Brazilian subsidiaries. 

Interest 

Our earnings and cash flows are also affected by changes in interest rates. These changes could have an impact on the interest rates that financial institutions charge us prior to the time we sell our MercadoPago receivables. As of   September   3  0, 2016  , MercadoPago s funds receivable from customers totaled $  226.8   million. Interest rate fluctuations could also negatively affect certain of our fixed rate and floating rate investments comprised primarily of time deposits, money market funds, investment grade corporate debt secur  ities   and sovereign debt securities. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. 

Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. As of   September   3  0  , 201  6  , the average duration of our available for sale securities, defined as the approximate percentage change in price for a 100-basis-point change in yield, was 1.  25  %. If interest rates were to instantaneously increase (decrease) by 100 basis points, the fair market value of our available for sale securities as of   September   3  0  , 201  6   could decrease (increase) by approximately $4.  1   million. 

As   of   September   3  0  , 201  6  , our short-term investments amounted to $  283.7   million and our long-term investments amounted to $  155.2   million  . These investments can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date.

On August 2, 2016, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adopted the 2016 LTRP which provides for the grant to eligible employees of a fixed award (the 2016 LTRP Fixed Award) and a variable award (the 2016 LTRP Variable Award). In order to receive awards under the 2016 LTRP, each eligible employee must satisfy the performance conditions established by the Board of Directors for such employee, which generally are expected to be based on pre-set goals for the Company s financial and operational performance. If these conditions are satisfied, the eligible employee will, subject to his or her continued employment as of each applicable payment date, receive the full amount of his or her 2016 LTRP Awards, payable as follows: 

Fixed award: The eligible employee will receive a fixed payment equal to 16.66% of his or her 2016 LTRP Fixed Award once a year for a period of six years starting in March 2017 (the  Annual Fixed Payment ); and     

Variable award: On each date the Company pays the Annual Fixed Award to the eligible employee, he or she will also receive the 2016 LTRP Variable Award payment equal to the product of (i) 16.66% of the applicable 2016 LTRP Variable Award

and (ii) the quotient of (a) divided by (b), where (a), the numerator, equals the Applicable Year Stock Price (as defined below) and (b), the denominator, equals the 2015 Stock Price (as defined below). For purposes of the 2016 LTRP, the  2015 Stock Price  shall equal $111.02 (the average closing price of the Company s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the final 60 -trading days of 2015) and the  Applicable Year Stock Price  shall equal the average closing price of the Company s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the final 60-trading days of the year preceding the applicable payment date for so long as the Company s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ.     

The 2016 LTRP is filed as Exhibit 10.08 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 5, 2016, and the description of the 2016 LTRP above is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. 

The 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 variable payment LTRP liability subjects us to equity price risk. The following table shows a sensitivity analysis of the risk associated with our contractual obligations related to the 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Variable Payments if our common stock price per share were to increase or decrease by up to   40%:

It    em 1   Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The number and significance of these disputes is increasing as our business expands and our Company grows. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, may be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources or require expensive implementations of changes to our business methods to respond to these claims. See  Item 1A   Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2016. 

As of   September   30, 2016, our total reserves for proceeding-related contingencies and other estimated contingencies were approximately $  5  .  6   million to cover legal actions against us in which we have determined that a loss is probable. The proceeding-related reserve is based on developments   to date and historical information related to actions filed against us. We do not reserve for losses we determine to be possible or remote. Expected legal costs related to litigations are accrued when the legal service is actually provided. 

As of   September 30, 2016, there were 687   lawsuits pending against our Brazilian subsidiaries in the Brazilian ordinary courts. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016, there were 2,904   lawsuits pending against our Brazilian subsidiaries in the Brazilian consumer courts, where a lawyer is not required to file or pursue a claim. 

As of   September   30, 2016, there were 5  8   lawsuits pending against our Argentine subsidiaries in the Argentine ordinary courts and 1,3  79   pending claims in the Argentine Consumer Protection Agencies, where a lawyer is not required to file or pursue a claim. 

As of   September 30, 2016, there were seven   claims pending against our Mexican subsidiaries in the Mexican ordinary courts and   156   claims pending against our Mexican subsidiaries in the Mexican Consumer Protection Agencies, where a lawyer is not required to file or pursue a claim. 

In most of these cases, the plaintiffs asserted that we were responsible for fraud committed against them, or responsible for damages suffered when purchasing an item on our website, when using MercadoPago, or when we invoiced them. We believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims and intend to continue defending them. 

Set forth below is a description of the legal proceedings that we have determined to be material to our business. We have excluded ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our business. In each of these proceedings we also believe we have meritorious defenses, and intend to continue defending ourselves in these actions. We have established a reserve for those proceedings which we have considered that a loss is probable. The disclosure below updates and supplements the information set forth in  Item 3   Legal Proceedings  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,    2  015: 

In 2007  ,   S o Paulo tax authorities asserted taxes and fines against our Brazilian subsidiary relating to the period from 2005 to 2007 in an amount of   $5.9   million according to the exchange rate in effect at that time. As of the date of these consolidated financial statements   and following an administrative determination reducing the fine  , the total amount of the claim is   $4.2   million including surcharges and interest. On August 15, 2011, the Company made a deposit in court of   R$9.5   million, which including accrued interests amounted to   R$13.5   million or   $4.2   million, according to the exchange rate at   September   30, 2016  . The company continues to contest the assessment.   On May 31, 2016, a lower court judge ruled in favor of the Company and the S o Paulo Municipal Council presented a motion to clarify mentioned decision.   As of the date of issuance of this report, the Company is still waiting for a decision.    

On November 6, 2014 the Company s Brazilian subsidiaries requested a preliminary injunction against Receita Federal Do Brasil in order to avoid the income tax withholding over payments remitted by Brazilian subsidiaries to the Argentine subsidiary for the provision of IT support and assistance services; and requested the reimbursement of the amounts improperly withheld in the last five years. The injunction was granted   on the grounds   that such withholding violates the provisions of the convention signed between the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Argentine Republic to prevent double taxation. In August 2015, such injunction was revoked by the first instance judge decision of merit, which was favorable to Receita Federal Do Brasil. The Company presented an appeal in September 2015 and  ,   as of   September 30, 2016, the Company is waiting fo  r the second instance decision. As a result, the Company started making deposits in court for the controversial a  mounts. As of   September   30, 2016, the Company recorded in the balance s  heet deposits in court for R20.4 million or $6.3   million, according to the exchange rate at   September   30, 2016 under the caption non-current other assets.   The Company s management, based on the external legal counsel opinion, believes that the tax position adopted is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position and the existence of favorable decisions of the Federal Regional Courts. For that reason, the Company has not recorded any expense or liability for the controversial amounts.

On September 2, 2011, the Brazilian Federal tax authority has asserted taxes and fines against our Brazilian subsidiary relating to the income tax for the 2006 period in an approximate amount of   R$5.1   million or $1.5     million, according to the exchange rate at   September   30, 2016. On September 30, 2011  ,   the Company presented administrative defenses against the authorities  claim. On August 24, 2012  ,   the Company presented its appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals (CARF   Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais) against the tax authorities  claims. On December 5, 2013, the Board of Tax Appeals ruled against MercadoLivre s appeal. The same Board of Tax Appeals recognized as due part of the tax compensation made by the Company, decreasing the outstanding debit to R$2.0 million or $616 thousands  ,   according to the exchange rate at September 30, 2016. On November 21, 2014, the Company appealed to the Superior Administrative Court of Tax Appeals.   On September   8, 2016  ,   our appeal was not accepted. MercadoLivre filed an appeal   to the   Superior Administrative Court of Tax Appeals. As of the date of this report  ,   the Superior Administrative Court of Tax Appeals ruling was still pending.   Our management, based on the external legal counsel opinion, believes that the tax position adopted is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position.   For that reason, the Company has not recorded any expense or liability for the controversial amounts. 

Intellectual Property Claims 

In the past third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We have been notified of several potential third-party claims for intellectual property infringement through our website. These claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming, can be costly to resolve, could cause service upgrade delays, and could require expensive implementations of changes to our business methods to respond to these claims.  

Item 1A   Risk     Factors 

As of   September   30, 2016, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and in our Form  s   10-Q for the quarter  s   ended March 31, 2016   and June 30, 2016  .
