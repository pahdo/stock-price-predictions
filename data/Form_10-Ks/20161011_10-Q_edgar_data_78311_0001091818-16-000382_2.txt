  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE A   Basis of Presentation  
   
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of SoOum Corp. (the  Company ) included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).

These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC. 
   
 The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods presented.  The results of operations for these periods are not necessarily comparable to, or indicative of, results of any other interim period or for the fiscal year taken as a whole.  Certain information that is not required for interim financial reporting purposes has been omitted. 
   
  Principles of Consolidation  
   
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SoOum Corp., and its wholly owned subsidiaries; Nature Vision, Inc. and SoOum (the  Company ).  All significant inter-company balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
  NOTE D   Acquisition   iPoint Television  
   
 On January 15, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of 90% of the issued and outstanding membership interest of iPoint.  Pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Agreement the Company issued Clark Ortiz, the Company s CEO and Chairman, 25,000,000 shares of Swordfish s Series A Preferred Stock, which has voting rights equal to 100 shares of the Company s common stock and is convertible into the Company s common stock at the rate of 10 shares of common stock for each share of Series A Preferred Stock.  In addition to issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company agreed as part of the purchase price to issue 50,000,000 shares of its common stock to Mr. Ortiz.  At the date of the transaction, the Company didn t have any authorized and unissued shares available to issue to Mr. Ortiz, however in order to close the transaction, Mr. Ortiz agreed to close the transaction pending the Company increasing the authorized shares of common stock, which the Company did on March 25, 2014.  As a result of the transaction, the Company owns 90% of issued and outstanding membership interests in iPoint Television LLC and is therefore a majority owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company will be able to report the results of iPoint on a consolidated basis in the Company s financial statements.  iPoint Television, also known as iPoint TV, is a Smart media and entertainment company, which holds development licenses from Apple, Android, Google, Roku, Kindle and most every smart device.  iPoint is  a full service Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), media entertainment company which develops applications for mobile and TV smart devices. As an acquisition of common control we are recording the assets acquired at their cost which is $0. The Company incurred $2,500 of acquisition expense which was expensed. iPoint did not have any results from operations from the date of acquisition through June 30, 2016.  
   
  NOTE E   Going Concern   
   
 The Company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has reported recurring losses from operations.  As a result, there is an accumulated deficit of at June 30, 2016. 
   
 The Company s continued existence is dependent upon its ability to raise capital or acquire a marketable company.  The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE F   Term Notes Payable  
   
  The Company is in default on all of the following unsecured term notes payable.

SOOUM CORP.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE G   Convertible Promissory Notes Payable  
   
  As of June 30, 2016, the Company has outstanding eight (8) security purchase agreements with accredited investors for the sale of convertible promissory notes bearing interest at 10% - 12%, per annum.  Pursuant to the convertible promissory notes the investor may convert the amount paid towards the Securities Purchase Agreements into common stock of the Company.  Conversion prices vary based on the agreements and have various discount rates and terms. Trading price means the closing bid price on the OTC Market Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board Pink Sheets. 
   
 The conversion rights embedded in the Notes are accounted for as derivative financial instruments because of the down round feature of the conversion price.  The beneficial conversion feature was valued at the date of issuance using the Black-Scholes-Merton options pricing model with the following assumptions:  risk free interest rates ranging from .07% to .45%, contractual expected life of six (6) to twelve (12) months, expected volatility of 185% to 931%, calculated using the historical closing price of the company s common stock, and dividend yield of zero, resulting in fair market value. 
   
    The Company had convertible debentures outstanding as follows:

SOOUM CORP.   
  New York, New York  
   
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
  NOTE L   Fair Value   
   
 The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities recorded at fair value based upon the fair value hierarchy specified by GAAP.  All assets and liabilities are recorded at historical cost which approximates fair value, and therefore, no items were valued according to these inputs. 
   
 The levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
   
      Level 1 inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access;  
     
      Level 2 inputs utilize other-than-quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals; and  
     
      Level 3 inputs are unobservable and are typically based on our own assumptions, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity.  
     
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, the Company categorizes such financial asset or liability based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
   
 Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that are classified within the Level 3 category.  All assets and liabilities are at cost which approximates fair value and there are not items that were required to be valued on a non-recurring basis. 
   
 The following liabilities were valued at fair value as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. No other items were valued at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

NOTE M   Subsequent Events  
   
 On August 25, 2016 the Company entered into an exchange agreement with Western Grade, LLC.  Under the terms of the exchange agreement, Western Grade members will exchange their ownership interest for 420,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, which represents 42% ownership in the Company.  Western Grade will therefore be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

   Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared With Three Months Ended June 30, 2015   
   
 Net revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $428 and $-0-, respectively. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $3,423,390 compared to net income of $2,444,256 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. 
   
 Total operating expenses were $60,449 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $120,428 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  The primary expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were general and administrative expenses of $58,231 and interest expense of approximately $2,218 compared to general and administrative expenses of $48,288 and interest expense of approximately $72,140 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. 
   
 Total Other (Income) and Expenses were ($3,483,724) for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to ($2,573,864) for the three months ended June 30, 2015.   The primary other income and expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were loss on derivative of $19,806 and write off of liabilities of ($3,503,530) compared to gain on conversion feature of preferred shares of ($2,573,744) and gain on derivative of ($120) for the three months ended June 30, 2015. 
   
  Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared With Six Months Ended June 30, 2015  
   
 Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $427 and $-0-, respectively.  Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $6,391,079 compared to net income of $9,952,040 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. 
   
 Total operating expenses were $169,109 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $292,004 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The primary expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016   were general and administrative expenses of $113,737   and   interest expense of  approximately $55,372 compared to general and administrative expenses of $131,781 and interest expense of $160,223, for the six months ended June 30, 2015.   
 Total Other (Income) and Expenses were ($6,557,538) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to ($10,241,184) for the six months ended June 30, 2015.   The primary other income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were gain on derivative of ($6,922) and write off of liabilities of ($6,550,616) compared to gain on conversion feature of preferred shares of ($10,271,736) and loss on derivative of $30,552 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 Our operations used approximately $4,098 in cash for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Cash required during the six months ended June 30, 2016 came principally from cash proceeds from notes payable affiliates of $3,767 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
   
 Our operations provided approximately $6,195 in cash for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Investing activities used $12,862 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Cash required during the six months ended June 30, 2015, came principally from cash proceeds from notes payable of $6,619 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. 
   
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  We incurred net income of $6,391,079 and $9,952,040, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and had an accumulated deficit of $ 8,719,751 as of June 30, 2016.  We have managed our liquidity during the first and second quarters of 2016 through the revenues and issuance of notes.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty

Item 3:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk   
   
 Not applicable. 
   
  Item 4:   Controls and Procedures   
   
 (a) 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     
   
 Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  
   
 Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, after considering the existence of material weaknesses identified, determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016, primarily due to the fact that there is no effective separation of duties, which includes monitoring controls between the management. 
   
 (b) 
  Changes in internal controls .  
 There have been no significant changes in our internal controls or other factors that would significantly affect such controls and procedures subsequent to the date we completed our evaluation. Therefore, no corrective actions were taken.
