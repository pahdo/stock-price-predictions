Note 1 -   Organization and Business Operations    
  Realty Finance Trust, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Maryland on November 15, 2012 and conducts its operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Substantially all of the Company's business is conducted through Realty Finance Operating Partnership, L.P. (the  OP ), a Delaware limited partnership. The Company is the sole general partner and directly or indirectly holds all of the units of limited partner interests in the OP. 
  Benefit Street Partners L.L.C. serves as the Company's advisor (the "Advisor") pursuant to an advisory agreement executed on September 29, 2016 (the  Advisory Agreement ).  The Advisor, an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), is a credit-focused alternative asset management firm with over   $14 billion   in assets under management. The Advisor manages assets across a broad range of complementary credit strategies, including high yield, levered loans, private/opportunistic debt, liquid credit, structured credit and commercial real estate debt. The Advisor has over   115   professionals, including a   34  -person team dedicated to the Advisor's real estate platform. The Advisor is in partnership with Providence Equity Partners L.L.C., a global private equity firm with a combined   $47 billion   in assets under management.  Prior to September 29, 2016, Realty Finance Advisor, LLC ("Former Advisor") was the Company's advisor. The Former Advisor is controlled by AR Global Investments, LLC ("AR Global"). The Advisor is an affiliate of Providence Equity Partners L.L.C. 
   The Company is in business to originate, acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate debt secured by properties located both within and outside of the United States. The Company also invests in commercial real estate securities. Commercial real estate debt may include first mortgage loans, subordinated mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and participations in such loans. Real estate securities may include commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"), senior unsecured debt of publicly traded REITs, debt or equity securities of other publicly traded real estate companies and collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs"). 
  The Company has no employees. The Company has retained the Advisor to manage the Company's affairs on a day-to-day basis. The Advisor receives compensation and fees for services related to the investment and management of the Company's assets and the operations of the Company.  
   
  Note 2 -   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
  Basis of Accounting  
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes are unaudited and have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial statements and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X, as appropriate. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements may not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. In the opinion of management, the interim data includes all adjustments, of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented.  The current period s results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the entire year or any subsequent interim periods.  
  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of, and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 11, 2016. There have been no significant changes to the Company's significant accounting policies during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as described below. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The Company consolidates all entities that the Company controls through either majority ownership or voting rights. In addition, the Company consolidates all variable interest entities ("VIE") of which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary. VIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors (i) do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest and/or (ii) do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The entity that consolidates a VIE is known as its primary beneficiary and is generally the entity with (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE s economic performance and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the OP and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.     In determining whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the other partners or members as well as whether the entity is a VIE for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company has determined the OP is a VIE of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities are held by the OP.  
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of a collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") issued and securitized by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company has determined the CLO is a VIE of which the Company's subsidiary is the primary beneficiary. The Company has disclosed the assets and liabilities of the CLO on the face of the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 810 - Consolidation. 
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The allowance for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve is increased through the loan loss provision on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and is decreased by charge-offs when losses are confirmed through the receipt of assets, such as cash in a pre-foreclosure sale or upon ownership control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure or when significant collection efforts have ceased. The Company uses a uniform process for determining its allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses includes a general, formula-based component and an asset-specific component. 
  General reserves are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company currently estimates loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced in the industry, given the fact the Company has not experienced any losses, and takes into account current collateral and economic conditions affecting the probability and severity of losses when establishing the allowance for loan losses. The Company performs a comprehensive analysis of its loan portfolio and assigns risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. The Company considers, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographic location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from "1" to "5" with "1" representing the lowest risk of loss and "5" representing the highest risk of loss. 
  The asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on individual impaired loans. The Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it believes that it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on an individual loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan. 
  For collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. The Advisor generally will use the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, the Advisor will obtain external "as is" appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist.  
  A loan is also considered impaired if its terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"). A TDR occurs when a concession is granted and the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. Impairments on TDR loans are generally measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loans. 
  The Company designates non-performing loans at such time as (i) loan payments become 90-days past due; (ii) the loan has a maturity default; or (iii) in the opinion of the Company, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan.  Income recognition will be suspended when a loan is designated non-performing and resumed only when the suspended loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to have resumed. A loan will be written off when it is no longer realizable and legally discharged.

Per Share Data  
  The Company calculates basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to the Company for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for that period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from shares issuable in connection with the restricted stock plan and if convertible shares were exercised, except when doing so would be anti-dilutive.  
  Reportable Segments  
  The Company conducts its business through the following segments:  
             
    The real estate debt business which is focused on originating, acquiring and asset managing commercial real estate debt investments, including first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgages, mezzanine loans and participations in such loans. 
                
    The real estate securities business which is focused on investing in and asset managing commercial real estate securities primarily consisting of CMBS and may include unsecured REIT debt, CDO notes and other securities. 
     See   Note 12 - Segment Reporting   for further information regarding the Company's segments. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In February 2015, the FASB amended the accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities. The amendments modify the evaluation of whether certain legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs (particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships). The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company elected to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2016. The Company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and has determined the Company s OP is considered a VIE. However, the Company meets the disclosure exemption criteria as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and the Company's partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest in a business and the assets of the OP can be used for purposes other than settling its obligation, such as paying distributions. As such, the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based compensation. Among other things, the revised guidance allows companies to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted the provisions of this guidance beginning January 1, 2016, electing to account for forfeitures when they occur, and determined that there is no impact to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise to provide goods or services to a customer is performed in a principal or agent capacity and to recognize revenue in a gross or net manner based on its principal/agent designation. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes how entities measure credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost. The update eliminates the requirement that a credit loss must be probable before it can be recognized and instead requires an entity to recognize the current estimate of all expected credit losses. Additionally, the update requires credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be carried as an allowance rather than as a direct write-down of the asset. The amendments become effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments may be adopted early for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance on how certain transactions should be classified and presented in the statement of cash flows as either operating, investing or financing activities. Among other things, the update provides specific guidance on where to classify debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, payments for contingent consideration made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investments. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance where a reporting entity will need to evaluate if it should consolidate a VIE. The amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by changing how a single decision maker of a VIE treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

June 18, 2016, with a   one year   extension at the Company s option.  The Company exercised the extension option with the JPM Repo Facility lender, extending the maturity date to June 17, 2017. The Company entered into an amendment of the Barclays Repo Facility, dated as of September 2, 2016 (the  Barclays Amendment ), upon the payment of an amendment fee, pursuant to which the maturity date of the Barclays Repo Facility was extended to October 6, 2016. Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , the JPM Repo Facility was amended to, among other things, increase the maximum advance capacity to   $300 million  .

  The JPM Repo Facility and the Barclays Repo Facility generally provide that in the event of a decrease in the value of the Company's collateral, the lenders can demand additional collateral.  Should the value of the Company s collateral decrease, whether as a result of deteriorating credit quality, an increase in credit market spreads or otherwise, resulting margin calls may cause an adverse change in the Company s liquidity position.  
  Repurchase Agreements - Real Estate Securities 
  The Company has entered into various Master Repurchase Agreements (the "MRAs") that allow the Company to sell real estate securities while providing a fixed repurchase price for the same real estate securities in the future. The repurchase contracts on each security under an MRA generally mature in   30   to   90 days   and terms are adjusted for current market rates as necessary. Below is a summary of the Company's MRAs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

National Association as note administrator and U.S. Bank National Association as trustee, which governs the issuance of approximately   $350.2 million   principal balance secured floating rate notes (the  Notes ). In addition, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer also issued   78,188,494   Preferred Shares, par value of   $0.001   per share and with an aggregate liquidation preference and notional amount equal to   $1,000   per share (the  Preferred Shares ), which were not offered as part of closing the indenture. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Issuer and Co-Issuer are disregarded entities. 
  The Notes are collateralized by interests in a pool of   28   mortgage assets having a total principal balance of   $428.4 million   (the  Mortgage Assets ) originated by a subsidiary of the Company. The sale of the Mortgage Assets to the Issuer is governed by a Mortgage Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of October 19, 2015, between the Company and the Issuer. In connection with the securitization, the Issuer and Co-Issuer offered and sold the following classes of Notes to third parties: Class A, Class B, Class C. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Company retained approximately   $56.0 million   of the total   $76.0 million   of Class C and all of the preferred equity in the Issuer. The retained Class C and its related interest income and the preferred equity are eliminated in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company, as the holder of preferred equity in the Issuer, will absorb the first losses of the CLO, which may have a negative impact to the Company's result of operations. The issuance of the CLO also results in an increase in interest expense within the consolidated statement of operations. The following table represents the terms of the CLO issued.

  * Excludes   $56,044   and   $56,044   of Tranche C of RFT issued CLO held by the Company, which eliminates within the collateralized loan obligation line of the consolidated balance sheets as of  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
  The below table reflects the total assets and liabilities of the Company's only CLO. The CLO is considered a VIE and is consolidated into the Company's consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The Company is the primary beneficiary of the CLO because (i) the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE s economic performance and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.

Note 7 -   Common Stock    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   31,605,701   and   31,385,280   shares of common stock outstanding, respectively, including shares issued pursuant to the DRIP and unvested restricted shares.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had received total proceeds of   $755.5 million   and   $755.5 million  , respectively, excluding shares issued pursuant to the DRIP and share-based compensation.  
  On December 30, 2014, the Company filed with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation articles supplementary to its charter that reclassified   1,000   authorized but unissued shares of the Company s common stock as shares of convertible stock and set the terms of such convertible shares. The Company then issued   1,000   convertible shares to the Former Advisor for $  1.00   per share. The convertible shares automatically convert to shares of common stock upon the first occurrence of certain  triggering events (the "Triggering Event"), including the termination of the advisory agreement between the Former Advisor and the Company under certain circumstances.  In general, but with certain exceptions as outlined in the articles supplementary, each convertible share will convert into a number of common shares equal to 1/1000 of the quotient of (a) the conversion product (the product of   0.15   times the amount, if any, by which (i) the sum of the enterprise value as of the date of the Triggering Event plus total distributions paid to the Company s stockholders through the date of the Triggering Event

exceeds (ii) the sum of the Company's stockholders  invested capital plus a   6.0%   return as of the date of the Triggering Event) divided by (b) the quotient of the enterprise value divided by the number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding (on an as-converted basis) on the date of the Triggering Event. The conversion product will be reduced by the amounts payable pursuant to the annual subordinated performance fee as realized appreciation in the Company s assets during the time that the Former Advisor or one of its affiliates acts as the Company s advisor. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company determined that as a result of the termination of the advisory agreement between the Former Advisor and the Company a Triggering Event had occurred and, based on the Company s determination of the enterprise value of the Company on the date of the Triggering Event, the total distributions paid to the Company s stockholders through the date of the Triggering Event, and the sum of the Company's stockholders  invested capital as of the date of the Triggering Event, that the convertible shares converted into a number of common shares equal to   zero  .  As a result, the convertible shares that were issued to the Former Advisor have been extinguished and   no   common shares were issued in connection with the conversion. 
  Distributions 
  In order to maintain its election to qualify as a REIT, the Company must currently distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to   90%   of its taxable income, without regard to the deduction for distributions paid and excluding net capital gains. The Company must distribute   100%   of its taxable income (including net capital gains) to avoid paying corporate federal income taxes.  
  In May 2013, the Company's board of directors authorized, and the Company declared, a distribution payable on a monthly basis to stockholders of record on each day at a rate equal to $  0.00565068493   per day, which is equivalent to   $2.0625   per annum, per share of common stock. In   March 2016  , the Company's board of directors ratified the existing distribution amount a change to the daily distribution amount equivalent to   $2.0625   per annum and for calendar year 2016, affirmed a change to the daily distribution amount to   $0.0056352459   per day per share of common stock, effective January 1, 2016, to accurately reflect that 2016 is a leap year. The Company's distributions are payable by the fifth day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month. Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds. The Board may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time, and therefore, distributions payments are not assured. The Company distributed   $49.1 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , comprised of   $30.0 million   in cash and   $19.1 million   in shares of common stock issued under the DRIP.  The Company distributed   $31.8 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , comprised of   $18.2 million   in cash and   $13.6 million   in shares of common stock issued under the DRIP. On November 10, 2016 the Company s board of directors changed the DRIP offer price to $  20.05  , which is equal to the estimated per-share NAV as of September 30, 2016 approved by the board of directors.  The price change will apply to the reinvestment of distributions commencing with October 2016 distributions. 
  Share Repurchase Program 
  The Company's Board unanimously approved an amended and restated share repurchase program (the  SRP ), which became effective on February 28, 2016.  The SRP enables stockholders to sell their shares to the Company. Subject to certain conditions, stockholders that purchased shares of the Company's common stock or received their shares from us (directly or indirectly) through one or more non-cash transactions and have held their shares for a period of at least one year may request that the Company repurchase their shares of common stock so long as the repurchase otherwise complies with the provisions of Maryland law. Repurchase requests made following the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder will not be subject to any minimum holding period. 
  The repurchase price per share for requests other than for death or disability will be equal to the most-recent estimated net asset value per share of the Company's common stock calculated by the Company's Advisor and approved by the Company's board of directors in accordance with the Company's valuation guidelines, or estimated per-share NAV, multiplied by a percentage equal to (i)   92.5%  , if the person seeking repurchase has held his or her shares for a period greater than one year and less than two years; (ii)   95%  , if the person seeking repurchase has held his or her shares for a period greater than two years and less than three years; (iii)   97.5%  , if the person seeking repurchase has held his or her shares for a period greater than three years and less than four years; or (iv)   100%  , if the person seeking repurchase has held his or her shares for a period greater than four years. In the case of requests for death or disability, the repurchase price per share will be equal to the estimated per-share NAV at the time of repurchase. 
  Repurchases pursuant to the SRP, when requested, generally will be made semiannually (each six-month period ending June 30 or December 31, a  fiscal semester ). Repurchases for any fiscal semester will be limited to a maximum of   2.5%   of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the previous fiscal year, with a maximum for any fiscal year of   5.0%   of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the previous fiscal year. Funding for repurchases pursuant to the SRP for any given fiscal semester will be limited to proceeds received during that same

fiscal semester through the issuance of common stock pursuant to any DRIP in effect from time to time, provided that the Board has the power, in its sole discretion, to determine the amount of shares repurchased during any fiscal semester as well as the amount of funds to be used for that purpose. Any repurchase requests received during such fiscal semester will be paid at a price based on the Company's estimated per share NAV applicable on the last day of such fiscal semester, as described above. Due to these limitations, the Company cannot guarantee that the Company will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests made during any fiscal semester or fiscal year. However, a stockholder may withdraw its request at any time or ask that the Company honors the request when funds are available. Pending repurchase requests will be honored on a pro rata basis. The Company will generally pay repurchase proceeds, less any applicable tax or other withholding required by law, by the 31st day following the end of the fiscal semester during which the repurchase request was made. 
  Calculations of the Company's estimated per-share NAV will occur periodically, at the discretion of the Board, provided that such calculations will be made at least annually. Following its calculation, the Company's estimated per-share NAV will be disclosed in a periodic report. The most recent calculation of the Company's estimated per-share NAV approved by the Board occurred on November 10, 2016 based on the Company's net asset value as of September 30, 2016 and was equal to   $20.05  . 
  When a stockholder requests redemption and the redemption is approved, the Company will reclassify such obligation from equity to a liability based on the settlement value of the obligation. Shares repurchased under the SRP will have the status of authorized but unissued shares. 
    
  The following table reflects the number of shares repurchased under the SRP cumulatively through   September 30, 2016  : 

________________________ 
   1    As permitted under the SRP, in July 2016, our board of directors authorized, with respect to redemption requests received during the semi-annual period from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016, the repurchase of shares validly submitted for repurchase in an amount limited to the proceeds reinvested through our DRIP.  As a result, redemption requests in the amount of   208,470   shares were not fulfilled.

Litigation and Regulatory Matters 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company may become subject to litigation, claims and regulatory matters. Except as noted below, the Company has no knowledge of material legal or regulatory proceedings pending or known to be contemplated against the Company at this time.  On June 6, 2016, an action was filed against the Company and   two   of its directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and styled Rurode v. Realty Finance Trust, Inc., et. al., No. 1:16-cv-04553.  The plaintiff s individual and derivative complaint alleged that the Company made material misstatements in the proxy statement for its 2016 annual stockholder s meeting related to an alleged planned merger transaction between the Company and an affiliate of its former advisor.  The plaintiff alleged violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and sought to enjoin the Company s 2016 annual meeting.  On June 28, 2016, the parties filed, and the court subsequently entered,  a stipulation and order of dismissal of the action, but provided that the court would retain jurisdiction to consider any application by plaintiff for an award of attorneys  fees.  On October 20, 2016, the plaintiff submitted a request for   $0.75 million   in fees and expenses. The Company intends to oppose that request. The Company did not record any accrual in the   September 30, 2016   financial statements related fee and expense request as the Company does not believe it is probable there will be a judgment against the Company that would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 
   
  Note 9 -   Related Party Transactions and Arrangements    
  The Company entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor on September 29, 2016. 
  The Advisor receives an acquisition fee of   1.0%   of the principal amount funded by the Company to originate or acquire commercial mortgage loans and   1.0%   of the anticipated net equity funded by the Company to acquire real estate securities; provided, however, that if and when the aggregate purchase price for all investments acquired after the date of the Advisory Agreement reaches   $600,000,000  , the Company s obligation to pay acquisition fees to the Advisor shall terminate. The Company reimburses the Advisor for insourced expenses incurred by the Advisor on behalf of the Company related to selecting, evaluating, originating and acquiring investments in an amount up to   0.5%   of the principal amount funded by the Company to originate or acquire commercial mortgage loans and up to   0.5%   of the anticipated net equity funded by the Company to acquire real estate securities investments. In no event will the total of all acquisition fees and acquisition expenses exceed   4.5%   of the principal amount funded with respect to the Company's total portfolio including subsequent fundings to investments in the Company's portfolio. 
  The Company pays the Advisor, or its affiliates, a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of   1.5%   of stockholder s equity as calculated pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. The Company will pay the Advisor, an annual subordinated performance fee calculated on the basis of total return to stockholders, payable monthly in arrears, such that for any year in which total return on stockholders  capital exceeds   6.0%   per annum, the Advisor will be entitled to   15.0%   of the excess total return; provided that in no event will the annual subordinated performance fee payable to the Advisor exceed   10.0%   of the aggregate total return for such year.  The Company will reimburse the Advisor for expenses incurred related to administrative services such as accounting, legal and other services in accordance with the advisory agreement. Except as noted below, the Company did not make any payments to the Advisor for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Until September 29, 2016, the Former Advisor served as the Company s advisor and the Company paid the Former Advisor certain fees and expense reimbursements pursuant to its advisory agreement with the Former Advisor. 
  The Company also engaged in transactions with affiliates of the Former Advisor and AR Global.  Until January 2016, the Company had been engaged in a public offering of its common shares, which was registered with the SEC (the  Offering ). Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the "Former Dealer Manager") served as the dealer manager of the Offering through December 31, 2015.  American National Stock Transfer, LLC, a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager ("ANST"), provided the Company with transfer agency services through February 2016. RCS Capital Corporation, the parent company of the Company's Former Dealer Manager and certain of its affiliates that provided the Company with services, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016, prior to which they were under common control with AR Global. In May 2016, RCAP and its affiliated debtors emerged from bankruptcy under the new name, Aretec Group, Inc. 
  Share Ownership 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , entities wholly-owned by AR Global owned   52,771   and   8,888   shares of the Company s outstanding common stock, respectively.

In addition, the Former Dealer Manager received up to   3%   of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares, before reallowance to soliciting dealers, as a dealer manager fee. The Former Dealer Manager was permitted to reallow its dealer manager fee to such soliciting dealers. 
  The predecessor to AR Global was a party to a services agreement with RCS Advisory Services, LLC, ("RCS Advisory") a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager, pursuant to which RCS Advisory and its affiliates provided the Company and certain other companies sponsored by AR Global with services (including, without limitation, transaction management, compliance, due diligence, event coordination and marketing services, among others) on a time and expenses incurred basis or at a flat rate based on services performed. The predecessor to AR Global instructed RCS Advisory to stop providing such services in November 2015 and no services have since been provided to the Company by RCS Advisory.  
  The Company was also party to a transfer agency agreement with ANST, pursuant to which ANST provided the Company with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services), and supervisory services overseeing the transfer agency services performed by a third-party transfer agent. AR Global received written notice from ANST on February 10, 2016 that it would wind down operations by the end of the month and would withdraw as the transfer agent effective February 29, 2016. Subsequently, effective February 26, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with DST Systems, Inc., a third-party and its previous provider of sub-transfer agency services, to provide the Company directly with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services). 
  The table below shows the compensation and reimbursement to the Former Advisor, its affiliates, entities under common control with the Former Advisor and the Former Dealer Manager incurred for services relating to the Offering during the   three and nine months ended   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and the associated payable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively (in thousands):

  The Company is responsible for organizational and offering costs from the Offering, excluding commissions and Former Dealer Manager fees, up to a maximum of   2.0%   of gross proceeds from its Offering of common stock, measured at the end of the Offering. Organizational and offering costs in excess of the   2.0%   cap as of the end of the Offering are the Advisor's responsibility. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, organizational and offering costs exceeded 2.0% of cap of gross proceeds received from the Offering by   $0.8 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively which has been recorded in Additional Paid-In Capital of the Company's consolidated financial statements as the Former Advisor has not reimbursed the Company for these costs.

amount funded by the Company to originate or acquire commercial mortgage loans and up to   0.5%   of the anticipated net equity funded by the Company to acquire real estate securities investments. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , acquisition fees of   $0.3 million   and   $0.6 million   and for   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , acquisition fees of   $1.8 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively, have been recognized in Acquisition fees within the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   the Company capitalized   $0.5 million   and   $2.2 million  , of acquisition expenses in Commercial mortgage loans line within the Company's consolidated balance sheets, which will be amortized over the life of each investment using the effective interest method. The Company did not capitalize any acquisitions expenses for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company paid the Former Advisor, or its affiliates, a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of   0.75%   of the cost of the Company's assets. The asset management fee was based on the lower of the cost of the Company's assets and the fair value of the Company's assets (fair value will consist of the market value of each portfolio investment as determined by the Former Advisor in accordance with the Company's valuation guidelines). During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   , the Company incurred   $2.3 million   and   $7.1 million  , respectively, in asset management fees. The total asset management fees were incurred to both the Former Advisor and the Advisor, the Former Advisor receiving   $2.3 million   and   $7.1 million  , while the amount payable to the Advisor is   $26.4 thousand   for the   three and nine months ended  , respectively. During the   three and nine months ended     2015  , the Company incurred    $1.9 million   and   $2.4 million   in asset management fees, respectively, all of which were attributable to the Former Advisor. These asset management fees are recorded in Asset management and subordinated performance fee within the consolidated statement of operations.  Prior to June 17, 2015, the amount of the asset management fee was reduced to the extent that funds from operations as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("FFO"), as adjusted, during the six month period ending on the last day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date such asset management fee was payable, was less than distributions declared during the same period. For purposes of this determination, FFO, as adjusted, is FFO adjusted to (i) include acquisition fees and acquisition expenses; (ii) include non-cash restricted stock grant amortization, if any; and (iii) impairments and loan loss reserves on investments, if any (including commercial mortgage loans and other debt investments). FFO, as adjusted, is not the same as FFO.  
  The Company paid the Former Advisor an annual subordinated performance fee calculated on the basis of total return to stockholders, payable monthly in arrears, such that for any year in which total return on stockholders  capital exceeds   6.0%   per annum, the Former Advisor was be entitled to   15.0%   of the excess total return; provided that in no event will the annual subordinated performance fee payable to the Former Advisor exceed   10.0%   of the aggregate total return for such year. The Company did not incur an annual subordinated performance fee  during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . In the June 30, 2016 Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 11, 2016  the Company recorded an annual subordinated performance fee of   $1.3 million   for the six months ended June 30, 2016. This amount has been reversed as the Company determined that as of the date the advisory agreement with the Former Advisor was terminated, the conditions necessary for payment of the annual subordinated performance fee for 2016 had not been satisfied. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred an annual subordinated performance fee of   $0.6 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively. These subordinated performance fees are recorded in Asset management and subordinated performance fee within the statement of operations. 
  Effective June 1, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with the Former Dealer Manager to provide strategic advisory services and investment banking services required in the ordinary course of the Company's business, such as performing financial analysis, evaluating publicly traded comparable companies and assisting in developing a portfolio composition strategy, a capitalization structure to optimize future liquidity options and structuring operations. The Company prepaid the cost of a one-time   $0.9 million   fee associated with this agreement and amortized the cost over the estimated life of the Offering into Other expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. For period ending   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $6,000   of unamortized cost. There was   no   remaining unamortized cost as of   September 30, 2016   and these services are no longer being provided.

The table below depicts related party fees and reimbursements in connection with the operations of the Company for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the associated payable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):    

  ________________________ 
   1    Includes amortization of capitalized acquisition fees and expenses. 
  The payables as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   in the table above are included in "Due to affiliates" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  
  In order to improve operating cash flows and the ability to pay distributions from operating cash flows, the Former Advisor could elect to waive certain fees. The Former Advisor permanently waived a portion of the acquisition fees and expenses earned on the acquisition of the Company's CMBS in the amount of   $0.1 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The Company did not purchase any CMBS positions during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as such did not incur any acquisition fees and expenses for CMBS purchases. 
  Subject to the limitations outlined below, the Company reimbursed the Former Advisor's cost of providing administrative services and personnel costs in connection with other services during the operational stage, in addition to paying an asset management fee; however, the Company did not reimburse the Former Advisor for personnel costs in connection with services for which the Former Advisor received acquisition fees or disposition fees. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $2.5 million   and   $3.8 million   of administrative costs in connection with the operations of the Company, which is included in "Administrative services expenses" in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company did not incur such expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  The Former Advisor was required to pay any expenses in which the Company's operating expenses as defined by North American Securities Administrators Association at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceeds the greater of (i)   2.0%   of average invested assets or (ii)   25.0%   of net income for such expense year. For the preceding four fiscal quarters, the Company did not exceed the greater of the two aforementioned criteria as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Fees Paid to the Former Advisor in Connection with the  Listing of the Company's Common Stock or Termination of the Advisory Agreement  
  On December 30, 2014, the Company issued   1,000   convertible shares to the Former Advisor for $  1.00   per share. The convertible shares issued to the Advisor would convert to shares of the Company s common stock upon the first to occur of any of the Triggering Events described in Note 7. Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that as a result of the termination of the advisory agreement between the Former Advisor and the Company a Triggering Event had occurred and, based on the Company s determination of the enterprise value of the Company on the date of the Triggering Event, the total distributions paid to the Company s stockholders through the date of the Triggering Event, and the sum of the Company's stockholders  invested capital as of the date of the Triggering Event, that the convertible shares converted into a number of common shares equal to zero.  As a result, the convertible shares that were issued to the Former Advisor have been extinguished and no common shares were issued in connection with the conversion. 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , no fees were paid in connection with the liquidation of assets, listing of the Company's common stock or termination of the advisory agreement.

The Company has also established a restricted share plan for the benefit of employees, directors, employees of the Advisor and its affiliates.  
   
  Note 10 -   Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
  GAAP establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the observability of inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair values. GAAP establishes market-based or observable inputs as the preferred source of values, followed by valuation models using management assumptions in the absence of market inputs. The three levels of the hierarchy are described below: 
             
    Level I - Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
                
    Level II - Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level I) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life. 
                
    Level III - Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques. 
     The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the above hierarchy requires significant judgment and factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. 
  The Company has implemented valuation control processes to validate the fair value of the Company's financial instruments measured at fair value including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and the assumptions are reasonable.  
  CMBS are valued utilizing both observable and unobservable market inputs. These factors include projected future cash flows, ratings, subordination levels, vintage, remaining lives, credit issues, recent trades of similar real estate securities and the spreads used in the prior valuation. The Company obtains current market spread information where available and uses this information in evaluating and validating the market price of all CMBS. Depending upon the significance of the fair value inputs used in determining these fair values, these real estate securities are classified in either Level II or Level III of the fair value hierarchy. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company received broker quotes on each CMBS investment used in determining the fair value and have been classified as Level II due to the observable nature of many of the market inputs. 
  The following table presents the Company's financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets by its level in the fair value hierarchy as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):   

  A review of the fair value hierarchy classification is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets. The Company's policy with respect to transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy is to recognize transfers into and out of each level as of the beginning of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels within fair value hierarchy during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . There are no financial instruments carried at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are measured using observable quoted market prices, or Level I inputs and their carrying value approximates their fair value.  The fair value of borrowings under repurchase agreements approximate their carrying value on the consolidated balance sheets due to their short-term nature, and are measured using Level II inputs. 
  The fair values of the Company's commercial mortgage loans and collateralized loan obligations, which are not reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are reported below as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):

  The fair value of the commercial mortgage loans is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Advisor's experience with similar types of investments. The Company received broker quotes for each tranche of CLO to determine the fair value of the debt.

  Overview 
  We were incorporated in Maryland on November 15, 2012 and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. On May 14, 2013, we commenced business operations after raising in excess of $2.0 million of equity, the amount require for us to release equity proceeds from escrow. We are in business to originate, acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate debt secured by properties located both within and outside of the United States. We also invest in commercial real estate securities. Commercial real estate debt investments may include first mortgage loans, subordinated mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and participations in such loans. Commercial real estate securities may include CMBS, senior unsecured debt of publicly traded REITs, debt or equity securities of other publicly traded real estate companies and CDOs. 
  We have no employees. On September 29, 2016 we terminated our advisory agreement with our former advisor and entered into the Advisory Agreement with our Advisor.  The appointment of the Advisor and the execution of the Advisory Agreement were recommended by a special committee (the  Special Committee ) of our board of directors consisting exclusively of our independent directors. The Special Committee, with the assistance of its independent financial advisor and independent legal counsel, conducted a competitive process to select a new advisor before selecting the Advisor.  Our Advisor manages our affairs on a day-to-day basis.  The Advisor receives compensation and fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets and our operations.

The Advisor has over 115 professionals, including a 34-person team dedicated to the Advisor's real estate platform.  The Advisor is affiliated with Providence Equity Partners L.L.C. 
   On November 10, 2016, our board of directors unanimously determined an estimated NAV per share of our common stock of $20.05 as of September 30, 2016. The estimated NAV per share is based upon the estimated value of our assets less our liabilities as of September 30, 2016.  With the unanimous approval of the board of directors, we engaged Duff   Phelps, LLC, an independent third-party real estate advisory firm, who performed appraisals of our real estate assets. Our Advisor calculated the estimated NAV per share, and our board of directors, unanimously, approved the estimated NAV per share calculated by our Advisor. The valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of Practice Guideline 2013-01, Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs, issued by the Investment Program Association in April 2013.  Commencing with the reinvestment of our October 2016 monthly dividends in November 2016, the per share price for our dividend reinvestment program ("DRIP") offering will be equal to our new estimated per share NAV.

There were no impaired or specifically reserved loans in the portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our Loans had a weighted average coupon of   6.1%   and   6.1%  , and a weighted average life of   2.08   and   2.7   years, respectively.

   (1)    Our floating rate loan agreements contain the contractual obligation for the borrower to maintain an interest rate cap to protect against rising interest rates.  In a simple interest rate cap, the borrower pays a premium for a notional principal amount based on a capped interest rate (the "cap rate"). When the floating rate exceeds the cap rate, the borrower receives a payment from the cap counterparty

equal to the difference between the floating rate and the cap rate on the same notional principal amount for a specified period of time.  When interest rates rise, the value of an interest rate cap will increase, thereby reducing the borrower's exposure to rising interest rates. 
   (2)    Loan to value percentage is from metrics at origination.

Interest Income 
  The primary driver for increased interest income during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 was the increase in the size of our portfolio resulting from the investment of the capital raised in the Offering and increased leverage into real estate debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , our Loans had a total carrying value of   $1,120.9 million   and our CMBS investments had a fair value of   $57.6 million  , while as of   September 30, 2015  , the Loans had a total carrying value of   $939.7 million   and our CMBS investments had a fair value of   $101.0 million  . This increase was partially offset by a decrease in yield on our investments by   20   basis points quarter over quarter, primarily due to a shift in the composition of the portfolio predominately to lower yielding senior loans over the course of 2015 and 2016.  
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was $3.8 million higher than for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in average borrowings outstanding of approximately $240 million period over period and payment of various extension fees on the JPM Repo Facility and the BarclaysRepo Facility (together, the "Repo Facilities"). The increase in interest expense equates to a   120   basis point increase in rates on interest-bearing liabilities primarily due to the extension fees paid to our borrowers on the Repo Facilities. 
  Expenses from Operations 
  Expenses from operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were made up of the following (in thousands):   

  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , expenses from operations were primarily related to asset management and subordinated performance fees. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $1.1 million   and   $2.4 million   of asset management and subordinated performance fees, respectively, a decrease of $1.3 million, primarily due to reversal of approximately $1.3 million of subordinated performance fees. We have reversed the subordinated performance fees, as there was no subordinated performance fee for 2016 due to applicable conditions not having been satisfied. Additionally, we have incurred approximately   $2.5 million   of administrative service expenses related to general and administrative expense reimbursement to the Former Advisor for three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not have these expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , as the Former Advisor did not seek reimbursement for such expenses for the prior year's period. In addition, our professional fees increased by approximately $1.5 million during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   2015   due to engagement of various consulting and advisory fees. For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , our expenses from operations were primarily related to asset management and subordinated performance fees and acquisition fees of   $4.2 million  .

  Interest Income 
  The primary driver for increased interest income during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 was the increase in the size of our portfolio resulting from the investment of the capital raised in the Offering into real estate debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , our Loans had a total carrying value of   $1,120.9 million   and our CMBS investments had a fair value of   $57.6 million  , while as of   September 30, 2015  , the Loans had a total carrying value of   $939.7 million   and our CMBS investments had a fair value of   $101.0 million  . This increase was partially offset by a decrease in yield on our investments by   30   basis points during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to a shift in the composition of the portfolio predominately to lower yielding senior loans over the course of 2015 and into 2016.  
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was $9.6 million higher than for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in average borrowings outstanding of approximately $348 million period over period and payment of various extensions fees on the Repo Facilities, of which approximately   $287.5 million   is an increase due to the issuance of a CLO. The increase in interest expense also equates to a   20   basis points increase in rates on interest-bearing liabilities primarily due to the extension fees paid to our borrowers on the Repo Facilities.

Expenses from Operations 
  Expenses from operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were made up of the following (in thousands):   

  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , expenses from operations were primarily related to asset management and subordinated performance fees. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $7.1 million   and   $3.7 million   of asset management and subordinated performance fees, respectively, an increase of $3.4 million due to increase in portfolio size of approximately $140 million during first three quarters of 2016 compared to first three quarters of 2015. Additionally, there was no waiver of asset management fee during 2016 as was the case for 2015. The entire   $7.1 million   in the asset management and subordinated performance fee line is composed of asset management fees, as there was no subordinated performance fee for 2016 due to applicable conditions not having been satisfied. Additionally, we have incurred approximately $1.1 million more in professional fees during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared   2015   due to increase in consulting fees and legal fees, slightly offset by decrease in audit fees. Additionally, we have incurred approximately $3.8 million of administrative service expenses related to general and administrative expense reimbursement to the Former Advisor for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , while we did not have these expenses for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   as the Former Advisor did not seek reimbursement during this period.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , our expenses from operations were primarily related to acquisition fees of $6.0 million. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal demands for cash will be acquisition costs, including the purchase price of any investments we originate or acquire, the payment of our operating and administrative expenses, continuing debt service obligations, debt maturities, and distributions to our stockholders.  We currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments, payment of our operating and administrative expenses, debt service and repayments on borrowings and the payment of cash dividends, although given the termination of our Offering we continue to expect our new investments to be significantly lower in future periods than they were while the Offering was ongoing,  unless we decide to pursue raising additional equity capital.  
  Loan Repo Facilities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were party to repurchase facilities with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the "JPM Repo Facility") and Barclays Bank PLC (the "Barclays Repo Facility"). The JPM Repo Facility provided up to   $150.0 million   in advances. The Barclays Repo Facility provided up to   $150.0 million   in advances. Both, the JPM Repo Facility and Barclays Repo Facility are subject to various adjustments. The initial maturity date of the JPM Repo Facility was June 18, 2016, with a   one year   extension at our option.  We exercised the extension option with the JPM Repo Facility lender, extending the maturity date to June 17, 2017. We entered into an amendment of the Barclays Repo Facility, upon payment of an extension fee, dated as of September 2, 2016 (the  Barclays Amendment ), pursuant to which the maturity date of the Barclays Repo Facility was extended to October 6, 2016. Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , the JPM Repo Facility was amended to, among other things, increase the size to   $300 million  .  The proceeds from the increase in the size of the JPM Repo Facility was used to pay off the outstanding balance on the Barclays Repo Facility and the Barclays Repo Facility was terminated. Refer to Note 13-Subsequent Events. As of   September 30, 2016  ,we were in compliance with all debt covenants. 
   As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was   $130.0 million   and   $84.3 million   of principal outstanding on the JPM Repo Facility, respectively. On October 5, 2016, we entered into an amendment with JPM Morgan Chase amending the JPM Repo Facility. The amendment to the JPM Repo Facility increased our capacity from $150 million to $300 million, and we have utilized the upsize to draw down on the facility. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $111.9 million   and   $121.9 million   outstanding under the Barclays Repo Facility, respectively. As previously mentioned, on October 5, 2016, we have completely paid off the Barclays Repo Facility using proceeds from an amendment to the JPM Repo Facility. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

     Table of Contents  

The JPM Repo Facility and the Barclays Repo Facility generally provide that in the event of a decrease in the value of our collateral, the lenders can demand additional collateral.  Should the value of our collateral decrease, whether as a result of deteriorating credit quality, an increase in credit market spreads or otherwise, resulting margin calls may cause an adverse change in our liquidity position. 
  CMBS Master Repurchase Agreements ("MRAs") 
  We entered into various MRAs that allow us to sell real estate securities while providing a fixed repurchase price for the same real estate securities in the future. The repurchase contracts on each security under an MRA generally mature in 30 to 90 days and terms are adjusted for current market rates as necessary.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we entered into six MRAs, of which three were in use, described below (in thousands): 

(*)    Collateral includes   $54,643   and   $56,044    Tranche C of RFT issued CLO held by the Company, which eliminates within the real estate securities, at fair value line of the consolidated balance sheets as of  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  We expect to use additional debt financing as a source of capital. Under our charter, the maximum amount of our total indebtedness shall not exceed 300% of our total   net assets   (as defined by the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for exceeding such limit. This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments. At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value, which will enable us to satisfy our requirements under the North American Securities Administrators ("NASAA") Statement of Policy regarding REITs (the "REIT Guidelines"). However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits. We anticipate that adequate cash will be generated from operations to fund our operating and administrative expenses, continuing debt service obligations and the payment of distributions. 
  In addition to our current mix of financing sources, we may also access additional forms of financings, including credit facilities, securitizations, public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances by us or our subsidiaries, or through capital recycling initiatives whereby we sell certain assets in our portfolio and reinvest the proceeds in assets with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
   
  Distributions 
  On May 13, 2013, our board of directors authorized, and we declared, a distribution payable on a monthly basis to stockholders of record on each day at a rate equal to $  0.00565068493   per day, which is equivalent to $2.0625 per annum, per share of common stock. In March 2016, our board of directors ratified the existing distribution amount equivalent to $2.0625 per annum, and, for calendar year 2016, affirmed a change to the daily distribution amount to   $0.0056352459   per day per share of common stock, effective January 1, 2016, to accurately reflect that 2016 is a leap year. The distribution will be payable by the fifth day following the end of each month to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month. 
  The below table shows the distributions paid on shares outstanding during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   (in thousands):

Cash Flows 
  Cash Flows for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016 
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $27.6 million  . Cash inflows were primarily driven by net income of   $23.7 million  .    
  Net cash   provided by   investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $78.8 million  . Cash inflows were driven by proceeds from the sale of real estate securities of   $70 million   and principal repayments of   $51.1 million  , partially offset by additional funding of   $42.2 million   on existing loans.  
  Net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $60.3 million  . Cash inflows were primarily driven by   $35.6 million   from net borrowings on the JPM Repo Facility offset by   $44.5 million   from net payment on our CMBS MRAs, the payment of   $30.0 million   in cash distributions paid to stockholders and   $19.0 million   of stock redemptions. 
  Cash Flows for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $16.8 million. Cash inflows were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income to $30.4 million, but were partially offset by cash outflows mainly for acquisition fees of $8.4 million. 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $533.1 million. Cash outflows were primarily driven by originations and acquisitions with $526.9 million and $53.3 million representing our investment in 33 new loans and 5 new CMBS position, respectively and principal repayments of $47.1 million. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $529.4 million. Cash inflows were primarily driven by the $316.6 million from the issuance of common stock, $225.9 million from net borrowings on the JPM Repo Facility and the Barclays Repo Facility and $46.3 million from net borrowings on our CMBS MRAs which were partially offset by the payment of $37 million of offering costs and cash distributions of $18.2 million. 
   
  Related Party Arrangements 
  We entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor on September 29, 2016. 
  The Advisor receives an acquisition fee of 1.0% of the principal amount funded by us to originate or acquire commercial mortgage loans and 1.0% of the anticipated net equity funded by us to acquire real estate securities; provided, however, that if and when the aggregate purchase price for all investments acquired after the date of the Advisory Agreement reaches $600,000,000, our obligation to pay acquisition fees to the Advisor shall terminate. We reimburse the Advisor for insourced expenses incurred by the Advisor on our behalf related to selecting, evaluating, originating and acquiring investments in an amount up to 0.5% of the principal amount funded by us to originate or acquire commercial mortgage loans and up to 0.5% of the anticipated net equity funded by us to acquire real estate securities investments. In no event will the total of all acquisition fees and acquisition expenses exceed 4.5% of the principal amount funded with respect to our total portfolio including subsequent fundings to investments in our portfolio. 
  We pay the Advisor, or its affiliates, a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.5% of stockholder s equity as calculated pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. We will pay the Advisor, an annual subordinated performance fee calculated  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

on the basis of total return to stockholders, payable monthly in arrears, such that for any year in which total return on stockholders  capital exceeds 6.0% per annum, the Advisor will be entitled to 15.0% of the excess total return; provided that in no event will the annual subordinated performance fee payable to the Advisor exceed 10.0% of the aggregate total return for such year.  We will reimburse the Advisor for expenses incurred related to administrative services such as accounting, legal and other services in accordance with the advisory agreement.  
    Except as noted below, we did not make any payments to the Advisor for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  However, until September 29, 2016, the Former Advisor served as our advisor and we paid the Former Advisor certain fees and expense reimbursements pursuant to its advisory agreement with the Former Advisor, as discussed below. 
  Total Costs Incurred Due to Related Party Arrangements 
  The table below shows the costs incurred due to arrangements with our Former Advisor and its affiliates and the Advisor during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the associated payable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands). See   Note 9 - Related Party Transactions and Arrangements   for further detail. Of the amounts included in the table below, $26.4 thousand and $28.4 thousand for three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, for asset management fees and acquisition fees and expenses, were the only amounts payable to the Advisor.

  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  We have no off balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016 and through the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") and the Investment Program Association ("IPA") industry trade groups, have each promulgated measures respectively known as funds from operations ("FFO") and modified funds from operations ("MFFO"), which we believe to be appropriate supplemental measures to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO and MFFO is recommended by the REIT industry as supplemental performance measures. FFO and MFFO are not equivalents to our net income or loss as determined under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  
  We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the "White Paper"). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, property and asset impairment write-downs, depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO. Our business plan is to operate as a mortgage REIT with our portfolio consisting of commercial mortgage loan investments and investments in real  
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

estate securities. We will typically have no FFO adjustments to our net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP as a result of operating as a mortgage REIT. Although we have the ability to acquire real property, we have not acquired any at this time and as such have not had any FFO adjustments to our net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP. 
  Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically operate differently from exchange traded REITs because they generally have a limited life followed by a liquidity event or other targeted exit strategy. Non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation as compared to later years when the proceeds from their continuous public offering have been fully invested and when we are seeking to implement a liquidity event or other exit strategy. However, it is likely that we will make investments past the acquisition stage, albeit at a substantially lower level.  
  The origination and acquisition of debt investments is a key operating feature of our business plan that results in the generation of income and cash flows in order to make distributions to stockholders. Acquisition fees paid to our Advisor and acquisition expenses reimbursed to our Advisor in connection with the origination and acquisition of debt investments are evaluated in accordance with GAAP to determine if they should be expensed in the period incurred or capitalized and amortized over the life of the investment. Acquisition fees and acquisition expenses that are deemed to be expensed in the period incurred are included in the computation of net income or loss from operations. The amortization of acquisition fees and acquisition expenses that are able to be capitalized are included in the computation of net income or loss from operations. All such acquisition fees and acquisition expenses are paid in cash when incurred that would otherwise be available to distribute to our stockholders. When proceeds from our equity offerings have not been sufficient to fund the payment of acquisition fees and the reimbursement of acquisition expenses to our Former Advisor or Advisor, such fees and expenses have been paid from other sources, including financings, operating cash flow, net proceeds from the sale of investments or from other cash flows. We believe that acquisition fees and acquisition expenses incurred by us negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which such investments are originated or acquired by reducing cash flows and therefore the potential distributions to stockholders.  
  We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010 - 01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the "Practice Guideline") issued by the IPA in November 2010. We define MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable: acquisition fees (to the extent reflected in net income or loss from operations in the current period); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums and other loan expenses on debt investments; fair value adjustments on real estate related investments such as commercial real estate securities or derivative investments included in net income; impairments of real estate related investments, gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses from fair value adjustments on real estate securities, including commercial mortgage backed securities and other securities, interest rate swaps and other derivatives not deemed to be hedges and foreign exchanges holdings; unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums and other loan expenses on debt investments, gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. While we will be responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we expect to retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements. Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of our core operations.  
  Our MFFO calculation excludes impairments of real estate related investments, including loans. We assess the credit quality of our investments and adequacy of loan loss reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. For loans classified as held-for-investment, we establish and maintain a general allowance for loan losses inherent in our portfolio at the reporting date and, where appropriate, a specific allowance for loan losses for loans we have determined to be impaired at the reporting date. An individual loan is considered impaired when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Real estate related securities are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment when the fair value of a security falls below its net amortized cost. Significant judgment is required in this analysis. We consider the estimated net recoverable value of the loan or security as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the prospects for the borrower and the competitive situation of the region where the borrower does business. Fair value is typically estimated based upon discounting the expected future cash flows of the underlying collateral taking into consideration the discount rate, capitalization rate, occupancy, creditworthiness of major tenants and many other factors. This requires significant judgment and because it is based upon projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amounts ultimately realized may differ materially from the carrying value as of the balance sheet date. If upon completion of the assessment, the estimated fair value of the  
  
   40 

     Table of Contents  

underlying collateral is less than the net carrying value of the loan, a specific allowance for loan losses is recorded. In the case of real estate securities, all or a portion of a deemed impairment may be recorded. Due to our limited life, any allowance for loan losses or impairment of real estate securities recorded may be difficult to recover. 
  MFFO is a metric used by management to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter and is not intended to be used as a liquidity measure. Although management uses the MFFO metric to evaluate future operating performance, this metric excludes certain key operating items and other adjustments that may affect our overall operating performance. MFFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors.  
  We believe that FFO provides useful context for understanding MFFO, and we believe that MFFO is a useful non-GAAP measure for non-listed REITs. It is helpful to management and stockholders in assessing our future operating performance once our organization and offering and acquisition and development stages are complete, because it eliminates from net income non-cash fair value adjustments on our real estate securities and acquisition fees and acquisition expenses that are incurred as part of our investment activities. However, MFFO may not be a useful measure of our operating performance or as a comparable measure to other typical non-listed REITs if we do not continue to operate in a similar manner to other non-listed REITs, including if we were to extend our acquisition and development stage or if we determined not to pursue an exit strategy.  
  However, MFFO does have certain limitations. For instance, the effect of any amortization or accretion on investments originated or acquired at a premium or discount, respectively, is not reported in MFFO. In addition, realized gains or losses from acquisitions and dispositions and other adjustments listed above are not reported in MFFO, even though such realized gains or losses and other adjustments could affect our operating performance and cash available for distribution. Stockholders should note that any cash gains generated from the sale of investments would generally be used to fund new investments. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments may be based on many factors, including current operational or individual property issues or general market or overall industry conditions. 
  Neither FFO nor MFFO is equivalent to net income or loss or cash flow provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the GAAP methodology in evaluating our operating performance or our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. Neither FFO nor MFFO is necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Furthermore, neither FFO nor MFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indicator of our operating performance.  
  Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO. 

The table below reflects the items deducted or added to net income or loss in our calculation of FFO and MFFO for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
  Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to interest rate fluctuations. Many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk. To meet our short and long-term liquidity requirements, we may borrow funds at fixed and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. During the periods covered by this report, we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities. We do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We do not have any foreign denominated investments, and thus, we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our portfolio included 65 and 77 variable rate investments, respectively, based on LIBOR for various terms. Borrowings under our repurchase agreements are also based on LIBOR. The following table quantifies the potential changes in interest income net of interest expense should interest rates increase by 50 or 100 basis points or decrease by 25 basis points, assuming that our current balance sheet was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity:   

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of such period, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
  Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
  Except as noted below, during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

As of September 29, 2016, the Advisor replaced the Former Advisor as the Company s advisor.  In connection therewith, the Company appointed a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

In addition, the facilitate the transition from the Former Advisor to the Advisor, the Advisor has entered into a transitional services arrangement with the Former Advisor, including with respect to financial reporting services, and the Advisor has entered into employment agreements with a number of former employees of the Former Advisor that historically provided services to the Company, including services related to financial reporting.

PART II 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company may become subject to litigation, claims and regulatory matters. Except as noted below, the Company has no knowledge of material legal or regulatory proceedings pending or known to be contemplated against the Company at this time.  On June 6, 2016, an action was filed against the Company and   two   of its directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and styled Rurode v. Realty Finance Trust, Inc., et. al., No. 1:16-cv-04553.  The plaintiff s individual and derivative complaint alleged that the Company made material misstatements in the proxy statement for its 2016 annual stockholder s meeting related to an alleged planned merger transaction between the Company and an affiliate of its former advisor.  The plaintiff alleged violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and sought to enjoin the Company s 2016 annual meeting.  On June 28, 2016, the parties filed, and the court subsequently entered,  a stipulation and order of dismissal of the action, but provided that the court would retain jurisdiction to consider any application by plaintiff for an award of attorneys  fees.  On October 20, 2016, the plaintiff submitted a request for   $0.75 million   in fees and expenses. The Company intends to oppose that request. The Company did not record any accrual in the   September 30, 2016   financial statements related fee and expense request as the Company does not believe it is probable there will be a judgment against the Company that would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.

(A)(1) Except as set forth in any articles supplementary creating any class or series of Shares, no Person, other   than an Excepted Holder, shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Share Ownership   Limit and (2) no Excepted Holder shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares in excess of the Excepted   Holder Limit for such Excepted Holder.    (B) No Person shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares to the extent that such Beneficial   Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares would result in the Company being  closely held  within the   meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half   of a taxable year), or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT (including, but not limited to, Beneficial Ownership or   Constructive Ownership that would result in the Company actually owning or Constructively Owning an interest in   a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if the income derived by the Company from such   tenant would cause the Company to fail to satisfy any of the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the   Code).    (C) Any Transfer of Shares that, if effective, would result in the Shares being beneficially owned by fewer than   100 Persons (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be void ab initio, and the   intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such Shares.    (II) TRANSFER IN TRUST.  If any Transfer of Shares occurs which, if effective, would result in any Person   Beneficially Owning or Constructively Owning Shares in violation of Section 5.9(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B),    (A) then that number of Shares the Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of which otherwise would   cause such Person to violate Section 5.9(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) (rounded up to the nearest whole share) shall be   automatically transferred to a Trust for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as described in Section 5.9(iii),   effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer, and such Person shall   acquire no rights in such Shares; or    (B) if the transfer to the Trust described in clause (A) of this Section 5.9(ii)(a)(II) would not be effective for   any reason to prevent the violation of Section 5.9(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) then the transfer of that number of Shares that   otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section 5.9(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) shall be void ab initio, and the intended   transferee shall acquire no rights in such Shares.    To the extent that, upon a transfer of Shares pursuant to this Section 5.9(i)(II), a violation of any provision of this   Section 5.9 would nonetheless be continuing (for example where the ownership of Shares by a single Trust would   violate the 100 stockholder requirement applicable to REITs), then Shares shall be transferred to that number of   Trusts, each having a distinct Trustee and a Charitable Beneficiary or Beneficiaries that are distinct from those of   each other Trust, such that there is no violation of any provision of this Section 5.9.    (b) REMEDIES FOR BREACH.  If the Board shall at any time determine that a Transfer or other event has   taken place that results in a violation of Section 5.9(ii)(a) or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to   acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of any Shares in violation of Section 5.9(ii)(a) (whether or   not such violation is intended), the Board shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to   prevent such Transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the Company to redeem Shares, refusing   to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Company or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or   other event; provided, however, that any Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event in violation of Section   5.9(ii)(a) shall automatically result in the transfer to the Trust described above, and, where applicable, such Transfer   (or other event) shall be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board or a   committee thereof.    (c) NOTICE OF RESTRICTED TRANSFER.  Any Person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire   Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares that will or may violate Section 5.9(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) or   any Person who would have owned Shares that resulted in a transfer to the Trust pursuant to the provisions of   Section 5.9(ii)(a)(II) shall immediately give written notice to the Company of such event, or in the case of such a      

13   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     proposed or attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice to the Company, and shall provide to the   Company such other information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such   Transfer on the Company s status as a REIT.    (d) OWNERS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION.  Prior to the Restriction Termination Date:    (I) every owner of more than five percent (5%) (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the   Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) of the outstanding Shares, within 30 days after the end of each   taxable year, shall give written notice to the Company stating the name and address of such owner, the number of   Shares Beneficially Owned and a description of the manner in which such Shares are held. Each such owner shall   provide to the Company such additional information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if   any, of such Beneficial Ownership on the Company s status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the Share   Ownership Limit; and    (II) each Person who is a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner of Shares and each Person (including the   stockholder of record) who is holding Shares for a Beneficial Owner or a Constructive Owner shall provide to the   Company such information as the Company may request, in good faith, in order to determine the Company s status   as a REIT and to comply with requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such   compliance.    (e) REMEDIES NOT LIMITED.  Subject to Section 7.4 hereof, nothing contained in this Section 5.9(ii)(e)   shall limit the authority of the Board to take such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the   Company and the interests of its Stockholders in preserving the Company s status as a REIT.    (f) AMBIGUITY.  In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Section   5.9(ii), Section 5.9(iii), or any definition contained in Section 5.9(i), the Board shall have the power to determine the   application of the provisions of this Section 5.9(ii) or Section 5.9(iii) or any such definition with respect to any   situation based on the facts known to it. In the event Section 5.9(ii) or (iii) requires an action by the Board and the   Charter fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board shall have the power to determine   the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of Section 5.9. Absent a decision to the   contrary by the Board (which the Board may make in its sole and absolute discretion), if a Person would have (but   for the remedies set forth in Section 5.9(ii)(b)) acquired Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Shares   in violation of Section 5.9(ii)(a), such remedies (as applicable) shall apply first to the Shares which, but for such   remedies, would have been Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned (but not actually owned) by such Person,   pro rata among the Persons who actually own such Shares based upon the relative number of the Shares held by   each such Person.    (g) EXCEPTIONS.    (I) Subject to Section 5.9(ii)(a)(I)(B), the Board, in its sole discretion, may (prospectively or retroactively)   exempt a Person from the Share Ownership Limit and may establish or increase an Excepted Holder Limit for such   Person if:    (A) the Board obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as the Board determines are   reasonably necessary to ascertain that no individual s Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of such   Shares will violate Section 5.9(ii)(a)(I)(B);    (B) such Person represents that it does not, and undertakes that it will not, actually own or Constructively Own   an interest in a tenant of the Company (or a tenant of any entity owned or controlled by the Company) that would   cause the Company to actually own or Constructively Own more than a 9.9% interest (as set forth in Section   856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) in such tenant and the Board obtains such representations and undertakings from such   Person as are reasonably necessary to ascertain this fact (for this purpose, a tenant from whom the Company (or an   entity owned or controlled by the Company) derives (and is expected to continue to derive) a sufficiently small   amount of revenue such that, in the opinion of the Board, rent from such tenant would not adversely affect the   Company s ability to qualify as a REIT, shall not be treated as a tenant of the Company); and       

14   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     (C) such Person agrees that any violation or attempted violation of such representations or undertakings (or   other action which is contrary to the restrictions contained in Section 5.9(ii)(a) through Section 5.9(ii)(f)) will result   in such Shares being automatically transferred to a Trust in accordance with Section 5.9(ii)(a)(II) and Section   5.9(iii).    (II) Prior to granting any exception pursuant to Section 5.9(ii)(g)(I), the Board may require a ruling from the   Internal Revenue Service, or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board in   its sole discretion, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure the Company s status as a   REIT. Notwithstanding the receipt of any ruling or opinion, the Board may impose such conditions or restrictions as   it deems appropriate in connection with granting such exception.    (III) Subject to Section 5.9(ii)(a)(I)(B), an underwriter which participates in an Offering or a private placement   of Shares (or Securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own   Shares (or Securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) in excess of the Share Ownership Limit but only   to the extent necessary to facilitate such Offering or private placement.    (IV) The Board may only reduce the Excepted Holder Limit for an Excepted Holder: (1) with the written   consent of such Excepted Holder at any time, or (2) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and   undertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection with the establishment of the Excepted Holder   Limit for that Excepted Holder. No Excepted Holder Limit shall be reduced to a percentage that is less than the   Share Ownership Limit.    (h) INCREASE OR DECREASE IN SHARE OWNERSHIP LIMIT.  Subject to Section 5.9(ii)(a)(I)(B), the   Board may from time to time increase the Share Ownership Limit for one (1) or more Persons and decrease the   Share Ownership Limit for all other Persons; provided, however, that the decreased Share Ownership Limit will not   be effective for any Person whose percentage ownership of Shares is in excess of such decreased Share Ownership   Limit until such time as such Person s percentage of Shares equals or falls below the decreased Share Ownership   Limit, but any further acquisition of Shares in excess of such percentage ownership of Shares will be in violation of   the Share Ownership Limit and, provided further, that the new Share Ownership Limit would not allow five or fewer   Persons to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own more than 49.9% in value of the outstanding Shares.    (i) NOTICE TO STOCKHOLDERS UPON ISSUANCE OR TRANSFER.  Upon issuance or Transfer of   Shares prior to the Restriction Termination Date, the Company shall provide the recipient with a notice containing   information about the Shares purchased or otherwise Transferred, in lieu of issuance of a share certificate, in a form   substantially similar to the following:    The securities of Realty Finance Trust, Inc. (the  Company ) are subject to restrictions on Beneficial Ownership and   Constructive Ownership and Transfer for the purpose, among others, of the Company s maintenance of its status as   a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). Subject to certain   further restrictions and except as expressly provided in the Company s Charter, (i) no Person may Beneficially Own   or Constructively Own Shares in excess of 9.8% of the value of the total outstanding Shares or 9.8% (in value or in   number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of Shares unless such Person is an Excepted   Holder (in which case the Excepted Holder Limit shall be applicable); (ii) no Person may Beneficially Own or   Constructively Own Shares that would result in the Company being  closely held  under Section 856(h) of the Code   or otherwise cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT; and (iii) any Transfer of Shares that, if effective, would   result in the Shares being Beneficially Owned by fewer than 100 Persons (as determined under the principles of   Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be void ab initio and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such   shares. Any Person who Beneficially Owns or Constructively Owns or attempts to Beneficially Own or   Constructively Own Shares which causes or will cause a Person to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own Shares   in excess or in violation of the above limitations must immediately give written notice (or, in the case of an   attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice) to the Company. If any of the restrictions on transfer   or ownership as set forth in (i) and (ii) above are violated, the Shares in excess or in violation of the above   limitations will be automatically transferred to a Trustee of a Trust for the benefit of one (1) or more Charitable   Beneficiaries. In addition, the Company may redeem Shares upon the terms and conditions specified by the Board in   its sole discretion if the Board determines that ownership or a Transfer or other event may violate the restrictions      

15   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     described above. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of certain events, attempted Transfers in violation of the   restrictions described above may be void ab initio. All capitalized terms in this notice have the meanings defined in   the Company s Charter, as the same may be amended from time to time, a copy of which, including the restrictions   on transfer and ownership, will be furnished to each holder of Shares on request and without charge. Requests for   such a copy may be directed to the Secretary of the Company at its principal office.    (iii) TRANSFER OF SHARES IN TRUST.    (a) OWNERSHIP IN TRUST.  Upon any purported Transfer or other event described in Section 5.9(ii)(a)(II)   that would result in a transfer of Shares to a Trust, such shares shall be transferred to the Trustee as trustee of a Trust   for the exclusive benefit of one (1) or more Charitable Beneficiaries. Such transfer to the Trustee shall be effective   as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the purported transfer or other event that results in the   transfer to the Trust pursuant to Section 5.9(ii)(a)(III). The Trustee shall be appointed by the Company and shall be a   Person unaffiliated with the Company and any Prohibited Owner. Each Charitable Beneficiary shall be designated   by the Company as provided in Section 5.9(iii)(f).    (b) STATUS OF SHARES HELD BY THE TRUSTEE.  Shares held by the Trustee shall be issued and   outstanding Shares.  The Prohibited Owner shall have no rights in the Shares held in trust by the Trustee. The   Prohibited Owner shall not benefit economically from ownership of any Shares held in trust by the Trustee, shall   have no rights to dividends or other Distributions and shall not possess any rights to vote or other rights attributable   to the Shares held in the Trust.    (c) DIVIDEND AND VOTING RIGHTS.  The Trustee shall have all voting rights and rights to dividends or   other Distributions with respect to Shares held in the Trust, which rights shall be exercised for the exclusive benefit   of the Charitable Beneficiary. Any dividend or other Distribution paid prior to the discovery by the Company that   the Shares have been transferred to the Trustee shall be paid by the recipient of such dividend or other Distribution   to the Trustee upon demand and any dividend or other Distribution authorized but unpaid shall be paid when due to   the Trustee. Any dividend or other Distribution so paid to the Trustee shall be held in trust for the Charitable   Beneficiary. The Prohibited Owner shall have no voting rights with respect to Shares held in the Trust and, subject   to Maryland law, effective as of the date that the Shares have been transferred to the Trustee, the Trustee shall have   the authority (at the Trustee s sole discretion) (i) to rescind as void any vote cast by a Prohibited Owner prior to the   discovery by the Company that the Shares have been transferred to the Trustee and (ii) to recast such vote in   accordance with the desires of the Trustee acting for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary; provided, however,   that if the Company has already taken irreversible corporate action, then the Trustee shall not have the authority to   rescind and recast such vote. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.9, until the Company has received   notification that Shares have been transferred into a Trust, the Company shall be entitled to rely on its stock transfer   and other stockholder records for purposes of preparing lists of Stockholders entitled to vote at meetings,   determining the validity and authority of proxies and otherwise conducting votes of Stockholders.    (d) SALE OF SHARES BY TRUSTEE.  Within twenty (20) days of receiving notice from the Company that   Shares have been transferred to the Trust, the Trustee shall sell the Shares held in the Trust to a Person, designated   by the Trustee, whose ownership of the Shares will not violate the ownership limitations set forth in Section   5.9(ii)(a)(I) or (II). Upon such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the Shares sold shall terminate and   the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and to the Charitable Beneficiary as   provided in this Section 5.9(iii)(d). The Prohibited Owner shall receive the lesser of (1) the price paid by the   Prohibited Owner for the Shares or, if the Prohibited Owner did not give value for the Shares in connection with the   event causing the Shares to be held in the Trust (e.g., in the case of a gift, devise or other such transaction), the   Market Price of the Shares on the day of the event causing the Shares to be held in the Trust and (2) the price per   share received by the Trustee from the sale or other disposition of the Shares held in the Trust. The Trustee may   reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends and other Distributions which have   been paid to the Prohibited Owner and are owed by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to Section   5.9(iii)(c). Any Net Sales Proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner shall be immediately   paid to the Charitable Beneficiary. If, prior to the discovery by the Company that Shares have been transferred to the   Trustee, such Shares are sold by a Prohibited Owner, then (i) such Shares shall be deemed to have been sold on   behalf of the Trust and (ii) to the extent that the Prohibited Owner received an amount for such Shares that exceeds      

16   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     the amount that such Prohibited Owner was entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 5.9, such excess shall be paid   to the Trustee upon demand.    (e) PURCHASE RIGHT IN STOCK TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUSTEE.  Shares Transferred to the   Trustee shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Company, or its designee, at a price per share equal to   the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Trust (or, in the case of a   devise or gift, the Market Price at the time of such devise or gift) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Company,   or its designee, accepts such offer. The Company may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the   amount of dividends and other Distributions which have been paid to the Prohibited Owner and are owed by the   Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.9(iii)(c). The Company may pay the amount of such reduction   to the Trustee for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. The Company shall have the right to accept such offer   until the Trustee has sold the Shares held in the Trust pursuant to Section 5.9(iii)(d). Upon such a sale to the   Company, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the Shares sold shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute   the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner.    (f) DESIGNATION OF CHARITABLE BENEFICIARIES.  By written notice to the Trustee, the Company   shall designate one (1) or more nonprofit organizations to be the Charitable Beneficiary of the interest in the Trust   such that (i) the Shares held in the Trust would not violate the restrictions set forth in Section 5.9(ii)(a)(I) or (II) in   the hands of such Charitable Beneficiary and (ii) each such organization must be described in Section 501(c)(3) of   the Code and contributions to each such organization must be eligible for deduction under each of Sections   170(b)(1) (A), 2055 and 2522 of the Code.    SECTION 5.10 SETTLEMENTS.  Nothing in Section 5.9 shall preclude the settlement of any transaction entered   into through the facilities of any national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. The fact   that the settlement of any transaction occurs shall not negate the effect of any provision of Sections 5.7, and any   transfer in such a transaction shall be subject to all of the provisions and limitations set forth in Section 5.9.    SECTION 5.11 SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of Section 5.9 or any application of any such provision is   determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable by any court having jurisdiction over the issue, the validity and   enforceability of the remaining provisions of Section 5.9 shall not be affected and other applications of such   provision shall be affected only to the extent necessary to comply with the determination of such court.    SECTION 5.12 ENFORCEMENT.  The Company is authorized specifically to seek equitable relief, including   injunctive relief, to enforce the provisions of Section 5.9.    SECTION 5.13 NON-WAIVER.  No delay or failure on the part of the Company or the Board in exercising any   right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any right of the Company or the Board, as the case may be, except to the   extent specifically waived in writing.    SECTION 5.14 REPURCHASE OF SHARES.  The Board may establish, from time to time, a program or   programs by which the Company voluntarily repurchases Shares of Capital Stock from its Stockholders; provided,   however, that such repurchase does not impair the capital or operations of the Company. The Sponsor, the Advisor,   the Directors or any Affiliates thereof may not receive any fees arising out of the repurchase of stock by the   Company.    SECTION 5.15 DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLANS.  The Board may establish, from time to time, a   Distribution reinvestment plan or plans (each, a  Reinvestment Plan ). Under any such Reinvestment Plan, (i) all   material information regarding Distributions to the Stockholders and the effect of reinvesting such Distributions,   including the tax consequences thereof, shall be provided to the Stockholders not less often than annually and (ii)   each Stockholder participating in such Reinvestment Plan shall have a reasonable opportunity to withdraw from the   Reinvestment Plan not less often than annually after receipt of the information required in clause (i) above.    SECTION 5.16 PREEMPTIVE AND APPRAISAL RIGHTS.  Except as may be provided by the Board in setting   the terms of classified or reclassified Shares pursuant to Section 5.4 or as may otherwise be provided by contract   approved by the Board, no holder of stock shall, as such holder, have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe      

17   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     for any additional Shares or any other security of the Company which it may issue or sell. Holders of Shares shall   not be entitled to exercise any rights of an objecting stockholder provided for under Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL   or any successor statute unless the Board, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board, shall determine that   such rights apply, with respect to all or any classes or series of stock, to one (1) or more transactions occurring after   the date of such determination in connection with which holders of such Shares would otherwise be entitled to   exercise such rights.    ARTICLE VI.   BOARD OF DIRECTORS    SECTION 6.1 NUMBER OF DIRECTORS.  The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed under   the direction of the Board of Directors. The number of Directors of the Company (the  Directors ) shall be three,   which number may be increased or decreased from time to time pursuant to the Bylaws, but shall never be less than   the minimum required by the MGCL. A majority of the Board shall be Independent Directors, except for a period of   up to sixty (60) days after the death, removal or resignation of an Independent Director pending the election of such   Independent Director s successor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Independent Directors shall nominate replacements for vacancies among   the Independent Directors  positions. No reduction in the number of Directors shall cause the removal of any   Director from office prior to the expiration of his term. For the purposes of voting for Directors, each Share may be   voted for as many individuals as there are Directors to be elected and for whose election the Share is entitled to be   voted. Cumulative voting for Directors is prohibited.    SECTION 6.2 EXPERIENCE.  Each Director shall have at least three years of relevant experience demonstrating   the knowledge and experience required to successfully acquire and manage the type of Assets being acquired by the   Company.

Any Audit Committee established by the Board shall be composed solely of Independent Directors.    SECTION 6.4 TERM.  Except as may otherwise be provided in the terms of any Preferred Shares issued by the   Company, each Director shall hold office for one (1) year, until the next annual meeting of Stockholders and until   his successor is duly elected and qualifies. Directors may be elected to an unlimited number of successive terms.    SECTION 6.5 RESIGNATION, REMOVAL OR DEATH.  Any Director may resign by delivering his   resignation to the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer or the Secretary. Any resignation   shall take effect immediately upon its receipt or at such later time specified in the resignation. Any Director or the   entire Board may be removed from office with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less   than a majority of the Shares then outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, subject to   the rights of any Preferred Shares to elect or remove such Directors.    ARTICLE VII.   POWERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS    SECTION 7.1 GENERAL.  The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed under the direction of the   Board. In accordance with the policies on investments and borrowing set forth in this Article VII and Article IX   hereof, the Board shall monitor the administrative procedures, investment operations and performance of the   Company and the Advisor to assure that such policies are carried out. The Board may take any action that, in its sole   judgment and discretion, is necessary or desirable to conduct the business of the Company. The Charter shall be      

18   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     construed with a presumption in favor of the grant of power and authority to the Board. Any construction of the   Charter or determination made in good faith by the Board concerning its powers and authority hereunder shall be   conclusive. The enumeration and definition of particular powers of the Board included in this Article VII shall in no   way be limited or restricted by reference to or inference from the terms of this or any other provision of the Charter   or construed or deemed by inference or otherwise in any manner to exclude or limit the powers conferred upon the   Board under the general laws of the State of Maryland as now or hereafter in force.    SECTION 7.2 AUTHORIZATION BY BOARD OF STOCK ISSUANCE.  The Board may authorize the   issuance from time to time of Shares of any class or series, whether now or hereafter authorized, or securities or   rights convertible into Shares of any class or series, whether now or hereafter authorized, for such consideration as   the Board may deem advisable (including as compensation for the Independent Directors or without consideration in   the case of a stock split or stock dividend), subject to such restrictions or limitations, if any, as may be set forth in   the Charter or the Bylaws; provided that the issuance of Preferred Shares shall be approved by a majority of the   Independent Directors not otherwise interested in the transaction, who shall have access, at the Company s expense,   to the Company s legal counsel or to independent legal counsel.    SECTION 7.3 FINANCINGS.  The Board shall have the power and authority to cause the Company to borrow   or, in any other manner, raise money for the purposes and on the terms it determines, which terms may (i) include   evidencing the same by issuance of Securities and (ii) have such provisions as the Board may determine (a) to   reacquire such Securities; (b) to enter into other contracts or obligations on behalf of the Company; (c) to guarantee,   indemnify or act as surety with respect to payment or performance of obligations of any Person; and (d) to   mortgage, pledge, assign, grant security interests in or otherwise encumber the Company s Assets to secure any such   Securities, contracts or obligations (including guarantees, indemnifications and suretyships); and to renew, modify,   release, compromise, extend, consolidate or cancel, in whole or in part, any obligation to or of the Company or   participate in any reorganization of obligors to the Company.    SECTION 7.4 REIT QUALIFICATION.  The Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as   are necessary or appropriate to preserve the status of the Company as a REIT; provided, however, if the Board   determines that it is no longer in the best interests of the Company to continue to be qualified as a REIT, the Board   may revoke or otherwise terminate the Company s REIT election pursuant to Section 856(g) of the Code.

ARTICLE VIII.   ADVISOR    SECTION 8.1 APPOINTMENT AND INITIAL INVESTMENT OF ADVISOR.  The Board is responsible for   setting the general policies of the Company and for the general supervision of its business conducted by officers,   agents, employees, advisors or independent contractors of the Company. However, the Board is not required   personally to conduct the business of the Company, and it may (but need not) appoint, employ or contract with any   Person (including a Person Affiliated with any Director) as an Advisor and may grant or delegate such authority to   the Advisor as the Board may, in its sole discretion, deem necessary or desirable. The term of retention of any   Advisor shall not exceed one (1) year, although there is no limit to the number of times that a particular Advisor   may be retained.    SECTION 8.2 SUPERVISION OF ADVISOR.  The Board shall evaluate the performance of the Advisor before   entering into or renewing an Advisory Agreement, and the criteria used in such evaluation shall be reflected in the   minutes of the meetings of the Board. The Board may exercise broad discretion in allowing the Advisor to   administer and regulate the operations of the Company, to act as agent for the Company, to execute documents on   behalf of the Company and to make executive decisions that conform to general policies and principles established   by the Board. The Board shall monitor the Advisor to assure that the administrative procedures, operations and   programs of the Company are in the best interests of the Stockholders and are fulfilled. The Independent Directors      

20   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     are responsible for reviewing the total fees and expenses of the Company at least annually or with sufficient   frequency to determine that the expenses incurred are reasonable in light of the investment performance of the   Company, its Net Assets, its Net Income and the fees and expenses of other comparable unaffiliated REITs. Each   such determination shall be reflected in the minutes of the meetings of the Board. The Independent Directors also   will be responsible for reviewing, from time to time and at least annually, the performance of the Advisor and   determining that compensation to be paid to the Advisor is reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of   services performed and that such compensation is within the limits prescribed by the Charter. The Independent   Directors shall also supervise the performance of the Advisor and the compensation paid to the Advisor by the   Company in order to determine that the provisions of the Advisory Agreement are being carried out. Specifically,   the Independent Directors will consider factors such as (i) the amount of the fee paid to the Advisor in relation to the   size, composition and performance of the Assets, (ii) the success of the Advisor in generating opportunities that   meet the investment objectives of the Company, (iii) rates charged to other REITs and to investors other than REITs   by advisors performing the same or similar services, (iv) additional revenues realized by the Advisor and its   Affiliates through their relationship with the Company, including loan administration, underwriting or broker   commissions, servicing, engineering, inspection and other fees, whether paid by the Company or by others with   whom the Company does business, (v) the quality and extent of service and advice furnished by the Advisor, (vi) the   performance of the Assets, including income, conservation or appreciation of capital, frequency of problem   investments and competence in dealing with distress situations, and (vii) the quality of the Assets relative to the   investments generated by the Advisor for its own account. The Independent Directors may also consider all other   factors that they deem relevant, and the findings of the Independent Directors on each of the factors considered shall   be recorded in the minutes of the Board. The Board shall determine whether any successor Advisor possesses   sufficient qualifications to perform the advisory function for the Company and whether the compensation provided   for in its contract with the Company is justified.    SECTION 8.3 FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS.  The Advisor shall have a fiduciary responsibility and duty to the   Company and to the Stockholders.    SECTION 8.4 AFFILIATION AND FUNCTIONS.  The Board, by resolution or in the Bylaws, may provide   guidelines, provisions or requirements concerning the affiliation and functions of the Advisor.    SECTION 8.5 TERMINATION.  Either a majority of the Independent Directors or the Advisor may terminate   the Advisory Agreement on sixty (60) days  written notice without cause or penalty, and, in such event, the Advisor   will cooperate with the Company and the Board in making an orderly transition of the advisory function.    SECTION 8.6 DISPOSITION FEE ON SALE OF PROPERTIES.  The Company may pay the Advisor a real   estate commission upon Sale of one (1) or more Properties, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) one-half (1/2) of   the Competitive Real Estate Commission if a third party broker is also involved, or (ii) two percent (2%) of the sales   price of such Property or Properties. Payment of such fee may be made only if the Advisor provides a substantial   amount of services in connection with the Sale of a Property or Properties, as determined by a majority of the   Independent Directors. In addition, the amount paid when added to all other real estate commissions paid to   unaffiliated parties in connection with such Sale shall not exceed the lesser of the Competitive Real Estate   Commission or an amount equal to six percent (6%) of the sales price of such Property or Properties.    SECTION 8.7 INCENTIVE FEES.  The Company may pay (including through the issuance of an interest by the   Operating Partnership) the Advisor or its Affiliates an interest in the gain from the Sale of Assets, for which full   consideration is not paid in cash or property of equivalent value, provided the amount or percentage of such interest   is reasonable. Such an interest in gain from the Sale of Assets shall be considered presumptively reasonable if it   does not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the balance of such net proceeds remaining after payment to Stockholders,   in the aggregate, of an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Invested Capital, plus an amount equal to   six percent (6%) of the Invested Capital per annum cumulative. In the case of multiple Advisors, such Advisor and   any of their Affiliates shall be allowed such fees provided such fees are distributed by a proportional method   reasonably designed to reflect the value added to the Company Assets by each respective Advisor or any Affiliate.    SECTION 8.8 ORGANIZATION AND OFFERING EXPENSES LIMITATION.  The Company shall reimburse   the Advisor and its Affiliates for Organization and Offering Expenses incurred by the Advisor or its Affiliates;      

21   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     provided, however, that the total amount of all Organization and Offering Expenses shall be reasonable and shall in   no event exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the Gross Proceeds of each Offering.    SECTION 8.9 ACQUISITION FEES.  The Company may pay the Advisor and its Affiliates fees for the review   and evaluation of potential investments in Assets; provided, however, (i) that the total of all Acquisition Fees and   Acquisition Expenses shall be reasonable, and shall not exceed an amount equal to four and one-half percent (4.5%)   of the Contract Purchase Price, or, in the case of a Mortgage, four and one-half percent (4.5%) of the funds   advanced and (ii) that once all the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering have been fully invested, the total of all   Acquisition Fees shall not exceed an amount equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Contract Purchase   Price for all the Assets acquired; provided, however, that a majority of the Directors (including a majority of the   Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction may approve fees and expenses in excess of these   limits if they determine the transaction to be commercially competitive, fair and reasonable to the Company.    SECTION 8.10 ANNUAL SUBORDINATED PERFORMANCE FEE.  The Company may pay the Advisor an   Annual Subordinated Performance Fee ( Annual Subordinated Performance Fee ) calculated on the basis of the   Company s total return to Stockholders; provided, that in any year in which the Company s total return to   Stockholders exceeds six percent (6%) per annum, the Advisor shall receive fifteen percent (15%) of the excess total   return but shall not receive more than ten percent (10%) of the aggregate total return for such year.    SECTION 8.11 REIMBURSEMENT FOR TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES.  The Company may reimburse the   Advisor, at the end of each fiscal quarter, for Total Operating Expenses incurred by the Advisor; provided, however,   that the Company shall not reimburse the Advisor at the end of any fiscal quarter for Total Operating Expenses that,   in the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, exceed the greater of two percent (2%) of Average Invested   Assets or twenty five percent (25%) of Net Income (the  2%/25% Guidelines ) for such year. The Independent   Directors shall have the fiduciary responsibility of limiting Total Operating Expenses to amounts that do not exceed   the 2%/25% Guidelines unless they have made a finding that, based on such unusual and non-recurring factors that   they deem sufficient, a higher level of expenses (an  Excess Amount ) is justified. Any such finding and the reasons   in support thereof shall be reflected in the minutes of the meetings of the Board. Within sixty (60) days after the end   of any fiscal quarter of the Company for which there is an Excess Amount which the Independent Directors   conclude was justifiable and reimbursable to the Advisor, there shall be sent to the Stockholders a written disclosure   of such fact, together with an explanation of the factors the Independent Directors considered in determining that   such Excess Amount was justified. If the Independent Directors do not determine that excess expenses are justified,   the Advisor shall reimburse the Company at the end of the twelve month period the amount by which the annual   expenses paid or incurred by the Company exceeded the 2%/25% Guidelines.    SECTION 8.12 REIMBURSEMENT LIMITATION.  The Company shall not reimburse the Advisor or its   Affiliates for services for which the Advisor or its Affiliates are entitled to compensation in the form of a separate   fee.    SECTION 8.13 NO FEES UPON INTERNALIZATION.  If the Board elects to internalize any management   services provided by the Advisor, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership shall pay any compensation or   other remuneration to the Advisor or its Affiliates in connection with such internalization of management services.    ARTICLE IX.   INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND LIMITATIONS    SECTION 9.1 REVIEW OF OBJECTIVES.  The Independent Directors shall review the investment policies of   the Company with sufficient frequency (not less often than annually) to determine that the policies being followed   by the Company are in the best interests of its Stockholders. Each such determination and the basis therefor shall be   set forth in the minutes of the meetings of the Board.    SECTION 9.2 CERTAIN PERMITTED INVESTMENTS.  The following shall apply:    (i) The Company may invest in Assets.       

22   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     (ii) The Company may invest in Joint Ventures with the Sponsor, the Advisor, one (1) or more Directors or any   of their Affiliates only if a majority of Directors (including a majority of Independent Directors) not otherwise   interested in the transaction, approve such investment as being fair and reasonable to the Company and on   substantially the same terms and conditions as those received by the other joint venturers.    (iii) Subject to any limitations in Section 9.3, the Company may invest in equity securities, provided that such   investment shall be permitted only if a majority of Directors (including a majority of Independent Directors) not   otherwise interested in the transaction approve such investment as being fair, competitive and commercially   reasonable.    SECTION 9.3 INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS.  In addition to other investment restrictions imposed by the   Board from time to time, consistent with the Company s objective of qualifying as a REIT, unless otherwise   determined with or upon the approval of a majority of Independent Directors, the following shall apply to the   Company s investments:    (i) Not more than ten percent (10%) of the Company s total assets shall be invested in Unimproved Real   Property or mortgage loans on Unimproved Real Property.    (ii) The Company shall not invest in commodities or commodity future contracts. This limitation is not   intended to apply to futures contracts, when used solely for hedging purposes in connection with the Company s   ordinary business of investing in Real Estate assets and Mortgages.    (iii) Except for those Mortgages insured or guaranteed by a government or government agency, the Company   shall not invest in or make any Mortgage, unless an appraisal is obtained concerning the underlying property. In a   transaction in which a majority of the Independent Directors so determine, and in any transaction with the Advisor,   the Sponsor, any Director or any Affiliate thereof, such appraisal will be obtained from an Independent Appraiser   concerning the underlying property. Such appraisals shall be maintained in the Company s records for at least five   (5) years and shall be available for inspection and duplication by any holder of Common Shares for a reasonable   charge. In addition to the appraisal, a mortgagee s or owner s title insurance policy or commitment as to the priority   of the mortgage or condition of the title must be obtained.    (iv) The Company shall not make or invest in any Mortgage, including a construction loan, on any one (1)   property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage loans outstanding on the property, including the loans of the   Company, would exceed an amount equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the appraised value of the property as   determined by appraisal, unless substantial justification exists because of the presence of other underwriting criteria.   For purposes of this subsection, the  aggregate amount of all mortgage loans outstanding on the property, including   the loans of the Company  shall include all interest (excluding contingent participation in income and/or   appreciation in value of the mortgaged property), the current payment of which may be deferred pursuant to the   terms of such loans, to the extent that deferred interest on each loan exceeds five percent (5%) per annum of the   principal balance of the loan.    (v) The Company shall not invest in indebtedness secured by a mortgage on real property which is subordinate   to liens or other indebtedness or equity interests of the Advisor, the Sponsor, any Director or any Affiliate of the   Company.    (vi) The Company shall not issue (A) equity Securities redeemable solely at the option of the holder (except   that Stockholders may offer their Common Shares to the Company pursuant to any repurchase plan adopted by the   Board on terms outlined in the Prospectus relating to any Offering, as such plan is thereafter amended in accordance   with its terms); (B) debt Securities unless the historical debt service coverage (in the most recently completed fiscal   year) as adjusted for known changes is sufficient to properly service that higher level of debt; (C) equity Securities   on a deferred payment basis or under similar arrangements; or (D) options or warrants to purchase shares of Capital   Stock to the Advisor, the Directors, the Sponsor or any Affiliate thereof except on the same terms as such options or   warrants, if any, are sold to the general public. The foregoing restrictions shall not prevent the Company from   issuing options or warrants to the Advisor, the Directors, the Sponsor or any Affiliate thereof at exercise prices not   less than the fair market value of the underlying Securities on the date of grant and for consideration (which may      

23   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     include services) that in the judgment of the Independent Directors has a market value not less than the value of such   option or warrant on the date of grant. Options or warrants issuable to the Advisor, the Directors, the Sponsor or any   Affiliate thereof shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the outstanding Shares on the date of grant. The voting rights   per Share (other than any publicly held Share) sold in a private offering shall not exceed the voting rights which bear   the same relationship to the voting rights of a publicly held Share as the consideration paid to the Company for each   privately offered share bears to the book value of each outstanding publicly held share.    (vii) A majority of the Directors or a majority of a duly authorized committee of the Board shall authorize the   consideration to be paid for each Asset, ordinarily based on the fair market value of the Asset. If a majority of the   Independent Directors on the Board or such duly authorized committee determine, or if the Asset is acquired from   the Advisor, a Director, the Sponsor or their Affiliates, such fair market value shall be determined by a qualified   Independent Appraiser selected by such Independent Directors.    (viii) The Company will continually review its investment activity to attempt to ensure that it is not classified as   an  investment company  under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.    (ix) The Company will not make any investment that the Company believes will be inconsistent with its   objectives of qualifying and remaining qualified as a REIT unless and until the Board determines, in its sole   discretion, that REIT qualification is not in the best interests of the Company.    (x) The Company shall not invest in real estate contracts of sale unless such contracts are in recordable form   and appropriately recorded in the chain of title.    (xi) The Company shall not engage in trading, as opposed to investment activities.    (xii) The Company shall not engage in underwriting activities or distribute, as agent, securities issued by others.    (xiii) The aggregate amount of borrowing shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the Company s Net   Assets as of the date of the borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately seventy-five percent (75%)   of the cost of the Company s investments, unless the excess is approved by a majority of the Independent Directors   and disclosed to the Stockholders in the Company s next quarterly report to Stockholders following such borrowing   along with justification for such excess. This limitation, however, shall not apply to individual real estate assets or   investments.    (xiv) The Company shall not acquire securities in any entity holding investments or engaging in activities   prohibited by the restrictions on investments set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through (xiii) of this Section 9.3.    ARTICLE X.   CONFLICTS OF INTEREST    SECTION 10.1 SALES AND LEASES TO THE COMPANY.  The Company may purchase or lease an Asset or   Assets from the Sponsor, the Advisor, a Director, an officer or any Affiliate thereof upon a finding by a majority of   Directors (including a majority of Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction (i) that such   transaction is fair and reasonable to the Company and (ii) that such transaction is at a price to the Company no   greater than the cost of the Asset to such Sponsor, Advisor, Director, officer, Affiliate or, if the price to the   Company is in excess of such cost, substantial justification exists for the excess and the excess is reasonable. In no   event shall the purchase price paid by the Company for any such Asset exceed the Asset s current appraised value.    SECTION 10.2 SALES AND LEASES TO THE SPONSOR, ADVISOR, DIRECTORS OR AFFILIATES.  An   Advisor, the Sponsor, a Director, an officer or any Affiliate thereof may only purchase or lease Assets from the   Company if a majority of Directors (including a majority of Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in the   transaction determine that the transaction is fair and reasonable to the Company.    SECTION 10.3 OTHER TRANSACTIONS.       

24   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     (i) The Company shall not engage in any other transaction with the Sponsor, a Director, the Advisor or any   Affiliates thereof unless a majority of the Directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors) not   otherwise interested in such transaction approve such transaction as fair and reasonable to the Company and on   terms and conditions not less favorable to the Company than those available from unaffiliated third parties.    (ii) The Company shall not make loans to the Sponsor, the Advisor, a Director, an officer or any Affiliates   thereof except Mortgages pursuant to Section 9.3(ii) hereof or loans to wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.   The Sponsor, the Advisor, the Directors, the officers and any Affiliates thereof shall not make loans to the   Company, or to Joint Ventures in which the Company is a co-venturer, unless approved by a majority of the   Directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in such transaction as fair,   competitive, and commercially reasonable, and no less favorable to the Company than comparable loans between   unaffiliated parties.    (iii) The Company may enter into Joint Ventures with the Sponsor, the Advisor, a Director and any Affiliates   thereof, provided that (a) a majority of Directors (including a majority of Independent Directors) not otherwise   interested in the transaction approves the transaction as being fair and reasonable to the Company and (b) the   investment by the Company is on substantially the same terms as those received by other joint venturers.    ARTICLE XI.   STOCKHOLDERS    SECTION 11.1 MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS.  There shall be an annual meeting of the Stockholders, to be   held on such date and at such time and place as shall be determined by or in the manner prescribed in the Bylaws, at   which the Directors shall be elected and any other proper business may be conducted. The annual meeting will be   held upon reasonable notice on a date that is within a reasonable period of time following the distribution of the   Company s annual report to Stockholders, but not less than thirty (30) days after delivery of such report. The   Directors, including the Independent Directors, shall take reasonable steps to ensure that such notice is provided.   The holders of a majority of Shares entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, at an annual meeting at which a   quorum is present may, without the necessity for concurrence by the Board, vote to elect the Directors. A quorum   shall be the presence in person or by proxy of Stockholders entitled to cast at least fifty percent (50%) of all the   votes entitled to be cast at such meeting on any matter. Special meetings of Stockholders may be called in the   manner provided in the Bylaws, including by the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Chief Executive Officer,   a majority of the Directors or a majority of the Independent Directors, and shall be called by the Secretary of the   Company to act on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of Stockholders upon written request of   Stockholders entitled to cast not less than ten percent (10%) of all votes entitled to be cast on such matter at such   meeting. The written request must be delivered in person or by mail and must state the purpose of the meeting and   the matters proposed to be acted upon at the meeting. Within ten (10) days after receipt of such written request,   either in person or by mail, the secretary of the Company shall inform the Stockholders who made such request of   the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing a notice of the proposed meeting; and within (10) ten days of   his or her receipt of payment of such costs, the Secretary of the Company shall provide all Stockholders with written   notice, either in person or by mail, of such meeting and the purpose of such meeting. Notwithstanding anything to   the contrary herein, such meeting shall be held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than sixty (60) days after the   Secretary s delivery of such notice. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the meeting is called by written request of   Stockholders as described in this Section 11.1, such meeting shall be held at the time and place specified in the   Stockholders  request; provided, however, that if none is so specified, such meeting shall be held at a time and place   convenient to the Stockholders. If there are no Directors, the Secretary of the Company shall promptly call a special   meeting of the Stockholders entitled to vote for the election of successor Directors. Any meeting may be adjourned   and reconvened as the Board may determine or as otherwise provided in the Bylaws. Without the approval of a   majority of the Shares of stock entitled to vote on the matter, the Board may not (i) amend the Charter to materially   and adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Stockholders; (ii) amend provisions of the Charter   relating to director qualifications, fiduciary duties, liability and indemnification, conflicts of interest, investment   policies or investment restrictions; (iii) liquidate or dissolve the Company other than before the Initial Investment in   Property; (iv) sell all or substantially all of the Company s Assets other than in the ordinary course of business or as   otherwise permitted by law; or (v) cause the merger or similar reorganization of the Company except as permitted   by law.       

25   \\DC - 045418/000001 - 8136396 v3     SECTION 11.2 VOTING RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS.  Subject to the provisions of any class or series of   Shares of stock then outstanding and the mandatory provisions of any applicable laws or regulations, the   Stockholders shall be entitled to vote only on the following matters: (a) election or removal of Directors, without the   necessity for concurrence by the Board, as provided in Sections 6.1, 6.4 and 11.1 hereof; (b) amendment of the   Charter, without the necessity for concurrence by the Board, as provided in Article XIII hereof; (c) dissolution of the   Company, without the necessity for concurrence by the Board; (d) to the extent required under Maryland law,   merger or consolidation of the Company or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s   Assets; and (e) such other matters with respect to which the Board has adopted a resolution declaring that a proposed   action is advisable and directing that the matter be submitted to the Stockholders for approval or ratification. Except   with respect to the foregoing matters, no action taken by the Stockholders at any meeting shall in any way bind the   Board. Without the approval of a majority of the Shares of stock entitled to vote on the matter, the Board may not (i)   amend the Charter to materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Stockholders; (ii)   amend provisions of the Charter relating to director qualifications, fiduciary duties, liability and indemnification,   conflicts of interest, investment policies or investment restrictions; (iii) liquidate or dissolve the Company other than   before the Initial Investment in property; (iv) sell all or substantially all of the Company s Assets other than in the   ordinary course of business or as otherwise permitted by law; or (v) cause the merger or similar reorganization of the   Company except as permitted by law.    SECTION 11.3 EXTRAORDINARY ACTIONS.  Notwithstanding any provision of law permitting or requiring   any action to be taken or approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of Shares of stock entitled to cast a greater   number of votes, any such action shall be effective and valid if declared advisable by the Board and taken or   approved by the affirmative vote of holders of Shares entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on   the matter.    SECTION 11.4 VOTING LIMITATIONS ON SHARES HELD BY THE ADVISOR, DIRECTORS AND   AFFILIATES.  With respect to Shares owned by the Advisor, any Director or any of their Affiliates, neither the   Advisor, nor such Director(s), nor any of their Affiliates may vote or consent on matters submitted to the   Stockholders regarding the removal of the Advisor, such Director(s) or any of their Affiliates or any transaction   between the Company and any of them. In determining the requisite percentage in interest of Shares necessary to   approve a matter on which the Advisor, such Director(s) and any of their Affiliates may not vote or consent, any   Shares owned by any of them shall not be included.    SECTION 11.5 RIGHT OF INSPECTION.  Any Stockholder and any designated representative thereof shall be   permitted access to the records of the Company at all reasonable times, and may inspect and copy any of them for a   reasonable charge. Inspection of the Company books and records by the office or agency administering the securities   laws of a jurisdiction shall be provided upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours.    SECTION 11.6 ACCESS TO STOCKHOLDER LIST.

The Stockholder List shall be updated at least quarterly to reflect changes in the   information contained therein. A copy of the Stockholder List shall be mailed to any Stockholder so requesting   within ten days of receipt by the Company of the request. The copy of the Stockholder List shall be printed in   alphabetical order, on white paper, and in a readily readable type size (in no event smaller than 10-point type).

Neither the Stockholders nor the   Directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company shall be liable under any written instrument creating an   obligation of the Company by reason of their being Stockholders, Directors, officers, employees or agents of the   Company, and all Persons shall look solely to the Company s Assets for the payment of any claim under or for the   performance of that instrument. The omission of the foregoing exculpatory language from any instrument shall not   affect the validity or enforceability of such instrument and shall not render any Stockholder, Director, officer,   employee or agent liable thereunder to any third party, nor shall the Directors or any officer, employee or agent of   the Company be liable to anyone as a result of such omission.    ARTICLE XIII.   AMENDMENTS    The Company reserves the right from time to time to make any amendment to its Charter, now or hereafter   authorized by law, including any amendment altering the terms or contract rights, as expressly set forth in the   Charter, of any outstanding Shares.

ARTICLE XIV.   ROLL-UP TRANSACTIONS    (i) In connection with any proposed Roll-Up Transaction, an appraisal of all of the Company s assets shall be   obtained from a competent Independent Appraiser. The Company s assets shall be appraised on a consistent basis,   and the appraisal shall be based on the evaluation of all relevant information and shall indicate the value of the   assets as of a date immediately prior to the announcement of the proposed Roll-Up Transaction. The appraisal shall   assume an orderly liquidation of the assets over a 12-month period. If the appraisal will be included in a prospectus   used to offer the securities of a Roll-Up Entity, the appraisal shall be filed with the Securities and Exchange   Commission and the states as an exhibit to the registration statement for the offering. Accordingly, an issuer using   the appraisal shall be subject to liability for violation of Section 11 of the Securities Act, and comparable provisions   under state laws for any material misrepresentations or omissions in the appraisal.

(ii) The Company is prohibited from participating in any proposed Roll-Up Transaction:   (a) that would result in the holders of Common Shares having voting rights in a Roll-Up   Entity that are less than the rights provided for in Article XI hereof;   (b) that includes provisions that would operate as a material impediment to, or frustration of,   the accumulation of shares of stock by any purchaser of the securities of the Roll-Up Entity (except to the   minimum extent necessary to preserve the tax status of the Roll-Up Entity), or which would limit the ability   of an investor to exercise the voting rights of its securities of the Roll-Up Entity on the basis of the number   of shares held by that investor;   (c) in which investor s rights to access of records of the Roll-Up Entity will be less than   those described in Sections 11.5 and 11.6 hereof; or   (d) in which any of the costs of the Roll-Up Transaction would be borne by the Company if   the Roll-Up Transaction is rejected by the holders of Common Shares.   ARTICLE XV.   DURATION    If the Board has not determined to pursue a Liquidity Event by the sixth anniversary of the Termination of the Initial   Public Offering, the Board shall adopt a resolution declaring that a proposed liquidation of the Company is advisable   on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in, or referred to, in the resolution (the  Plan of Liquidation ) and   directing that the proposed Plan of Liquidation be submitted for consideration at either an annual or special meeting   of the Stockholders provided, however, that the adoption of a Plan of Liquidation by the Board and the submission   thereof to the Stockholders may be postponed if a majority of Directors, including a majority of Independent   Directors, determines that a liquidation is not then in the best interest of the Stockholders. If the adoption of a Plan   of Liquidation and the submission thereof to the Stockholders is so postponed, the Board shall reconsider whether   the liquidation is in the best interest of the Stockholders at least annually and further postponement of the adoption   of a Plan of Liquidation and the submission thereof to the Stockholders shall only be permitted if a majority of   Directors, including a majority of Independent Directors, again determines that a liquidation would not then be in   the best interest of the Stockholders. If the Board adopts a Plan of Liquidation and the Stockholders do not approve   the Plan of Liquidation, (i) the Company shall continue operating and (ii) upon the written request of Stockholders   owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the then outstanding Common Shares, the Board shall   resubmit the Plan of Liquidation for consideration by proxy statement to the Stockholders up to once every two (2)   years. If the Board adopts a Plan of Liquidation and the Stockholders approve the Plan of Liquidation, the Board   shall commence an orderly liquidation of the Assets pursuant to such Plan of Liquidation. If listing occurs on or   before the sixth anniversary of the Termination of the Initial Public Offering, the Company shall continue   perpetually unless dissolved pursuant to any applicable provision of the MGCL.

Subject to the limitations in Section 5, the Company shall   indemnify, and advance Expenses to, Indemnitee (a) as provided in this Agreement and (b) as   otherwise permitted by Maryland law in effect on the Effective Date and as amended from time   to time; provided, however, that no change in Maryland law shall have the effect of reducing the   benefits available to Indemnitee hereunder based on Maryland law as in effect on the Effective   Date.

-4-   an independent director of the Company; and (iv) such indemnification is recoverable only out of   the Company s net assets and not from the Company s stockholders;     (b) indemnification for any loss or liability arising from an alleged violation   of federal or state securities laws unless one or more of the following conditions are met:  (i)   there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged material   securities law violations as to Indemnitee; (ii) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on   the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to Indemnitee; or (iii) a court of competent   jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against Indemnitee and finds that indemnification   of the settlement and the related costs should be made, and the court considering the request for   indemnification has been advised of the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission   and of the published position of any state securities regulatory authority in which securities of   the Company were offered or sold as to indemnification for violations of securities laws;      (c) indemnification hereunder if the Proceeding was one by or in the right of   the Company and Indemnitee is adjudged to be liable to the Company;   (d) indemnification hereunder if Indemnitee is adjudged to be liable on the   basis that personal benefit was improperly received in any Proceeding charging improper   personal benefit to Indemnitee, whether or not involving action in the Indemnitee s Corporate   Status; or     (e) indemnification or advance of Expenses hereunder if the Proceeding was   brought by Indemnitee, unless:  (i) the Proceeding was brought to enforce indemnification under   this Agreement, and then only to the extent in accordance with and as authorized by Section 12   of this Agreement, or (ii) the Company s charter or Bylaws, a resolution of the stockholders   entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or of the Board of Directors or an agreement   approved by the Board of Directors to which the Company is a party expressly provide   otherwise.   Section 6. Court-Ordered Indemnification.  Subject to the limitations in Section 5(a)   and (b), a court of appropriate jurisdiction, upon application of Indemnitee and such notice as the   court shall require, may order indemnification of Indemnitee by the Company in the following   circumstances:   (a) if such determines that Indemnitee is entitled to reimbursement under   Section 2-418(d)(1) of the MGCL, the court shall order indemnification, in which case   Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the Expenses of securing such reimbursement; or   (b) if such court determines that Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled   to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances, whether or not Indemnitee (i) has   met the standards of conduct set forth in Section 2-418(b) of the MGCL or (ii) has been adjudged   liable for receipt of an improper personal benefit under Section 2-418(c) of the MGCL, the court   may order such indemnification as the court shall deem proper.  However, indemnification with   respect to any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company or in which liability shall have been   adjudged in the circumstances described in Section 2-418(c) of the MGCL shall be limited to   Expenses.      

-5-   Section 7. Indemnification for Expenses of an Indemnitee Who is Wholly or Partly   Successful.  Subject to the limitations in Section 5, to the extent that Indemnitee was or is, by   reason of his or her Corporate Status, made a party to (or otherwise becomes a participant in) any   Proceeding and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of such Proceeding,   Indemnitee shall be indemnified for all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee   or on Indemnitee s behalf in connection therewith.  If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in   such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all   claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee under this   Section 7 for all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s   behalf in connection with each such claim, issue or matter, allocated on a reasonable and   proportionate basis.  For purposes of this Section 7, and without limitation, the termination of   any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be   deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.   Section 8. Advance of Expenses for an Indemnitee.  If, by reason of Indemnitee s   Corporate Status, Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be, made a party to any Proceeding, the   Company shall, without requiring a preliminary determination of Indemnitee s ultimate   entitlement to indemnification hereunder, advance all reasonable Expenses incurred by or on   behalf of Indemnitee in connection with (a) such Proceeding which is initiated by a third party   who is not a stockholder of the Company, or (b) such Proceeding which is initiated by a   stockholder of the Company acting in his or her capacity as such and for which a court of   competent jurisdiction specifically approves such advancement, and which relates to acts or   omissions with respect to the performance of duties or services on behalf of the Company, within   ten days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advance   or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding.    Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and   shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written affirmation by Indemnitee of   Indemnitee s good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the   Company as authorized by law and by this Agreement has been met and a written undertaking by   or on behalf of Indemnitee, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A or in such form   as may be required under applicable law as in effect at the time of the execution thereof, to   reimburse the portion of any Expenses advanced to Indemnitee, together with the Applicable   Legal Rate of interest thereon, relating to claims, issues or matters in the Proceeding as to which   it shall ultimately be established, by clear and convincing evidence, that the standard of conduct   has not been met by Indemnitee and which have not been successfully resolved as described in   Section 7 of this Agreement.  To the extent that Expenses advanced to Indemnitee do not relate   to a specific claim, issue or matter in the Proceeding, such Expenses shall be allocated on a   reasonable and proportionate basis.  The undertaking required by this Section 8 shall be an   unlimited general obligation by or on behalf of Indemnitee and shall be accepted without   reference to Indemnitee s financial ability to repay such advanced Expenses and without any   requirement to post security therefor.    Section 9. Indemnification and Advance of Expenses as a Witness or Other   Participant.  Subject to the limitations in Section 5, to the extent that Indemnitee is or may be, by   reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, made a witness or otherwise asked to participate in any   Proceeding, whether instituted by the Company or any other party, and to which Indemnitee is   not a party, Indemnitee shall be advanced all reasonable Expenses and indemnified against all      

-6-   Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee s behalf in   connection therewith within ten days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or   statements requesting any such advance or indemnification from time to time, whether prior to or   after final disposition of such Proceeding.  Such statement or statements shall reasonably   evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee.   Section 10. Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification.   (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit   to the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and   information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine   whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification.  Indemnitee may submit   one or more such requests from time to time and at such time(s) as Indemnitee deems appropriate   in Indemnitee s sole discretion.  The officer of the Company receiving any such request from   Indemnitee shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board   of Directors in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.   (b) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to   Section 10(a) above, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee s   entitlement thereto shall promptly be made in the specific case:  (i) if a Change in Control shall   have occurred, by Independent Counsel, in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of   which shall be delivered to Indemnitee, which Independent Counsel shall be selected by   Indemnitee and approved by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 2-418(e)(2)(ii) of   the MGCL, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; or (ii) if a Change in Control   shall not have occurred, (A) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting   of Disinterested Directors or, if such a quorum cannot be obtained, then by a majority vote of a   duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors consisting solely of one or more   Disinterested Directors, (B) if Independent Counsel has been selected by the Board of Directors   in accordance with Section 2-418(e)(2)(ii) of the MGCL and approved by Indemnitee, which   approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, by Independent Counsel, in a written opinion to the   Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee or (C) if so directed by a   majority of the members of the Board of Directors, by the stockholders of the Company.  If it is   so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be   made within ten days after such determination.  Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person,   persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee s entitlement to   indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance   request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from   disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such   determination in the discretion of the Board of Directors or Independent Counsel if retained   pursuant to clause (ii)(B) of this Section 10(b).  Any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in so   cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the   Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification)   and the Company shall indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.   (c) The Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of Independent   Counsel, if one is appointed.      

-7-   Section 11. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.   (a) In making any determination with respect to entitlement to   indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall   presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has   submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 10(a) of this Agreement, and   the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with   the making of any determination contrary to that presumption.     (b) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein,   by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or   entry of an order of probation prior to judgment, does not create a presumption that Indemnitee   did not meet the requisite standard of conduct described herein for indemnification.   (c) The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director,   officer, employee or agent of the Company or any other director, trustee, officer, partner,   manager, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other foreign or domestic   corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or   other enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining any other right to   indemnification under this Agreement.   Section 12. Remedies of Indemnitee.   (a) If (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 10(b) of this Agreement   that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advance of Expenses   is not timely made pursuant to Sections 8 or 9 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of   entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 10(b) of this Agreement   within 60 days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of   indemnification is not made pursuant to Sections 7 or 9 of this Agreement within ten days after   receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification pursuant   to any other section of this Agreement or the charter or Bylaws of the Company is not made   within ten days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to   indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication in an appropriate court located in   the State of Maryland, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, of Indemnitee s   entitlement to such indemnification or advance of Expenses.  Alternatively, Indemnitee, at   Indemnitee s option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator   pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.    Indemnitee shall commence a proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration   within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such   proceeding pursuant to this Section 12(a); provided, however, that the foregoing clause shall not   apply to a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his or her rights under Section 7 of this   Agreement.  Except as set forth herein, the provisions of Maryland law (without regard to its   conflicts of laws rules) shall apply to any such arbitration.  The Company shall not oppose   Indemnitee s right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.   (b) In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this   Section 12, Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification or advance of      

-8-   Expenses, as the case may be, under this Agreement and the Company shall have the burden of   proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advance of Expenses, as the case   may be.  If Indemnitee commences a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to this   Section 12, Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any advances   pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement until a final determination is made with respect to   Indemnitee s entitlement to indemnification (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted   or lapsed).  The Company shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, be precluded from   asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12 that the   procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall   stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all of the   provisions of this Agreement.   (c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 10(b) of this   Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such   determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12,   absent a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact   necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the   request for indemnification.   (d) In the event that Indemnitee is successful in seeking, pursuant to this   Section 12, a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce Indemnitee s rights   under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to   recover from the Company, and shall be indemnified by the Company for, any and all Expenses   actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in such judicial adjudication or arbitration.  If it   shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that Indemnitee is entitled to   receive part but not all of the indemnification or advance of Expenses sought, the Expenses   incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adjudication or arbitration shall be   appropriately prorated.     (e) Interest shall be paid by the Company to Indemnitee at the maximum rate   allowed to be charged for judgments under the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the   Annotated Code of Maryland for amounts which the Company pays or is obligated to pay for the   period (i) commencing with either the tenth day after the date on which the Company was   requested to advance Expenses in accordance with Sections 8 or 9 of this Agreement or the 60th   day after the date on which the Company was requested to make the determination of entitlement   to indemnification under Section 10(b) of this Agreement, as applicable, and (ii) and ending on   the date such payment is made to Indemnitee by the Company.   Section 13. Defense of the Underlying Proceeding.   (a) Indemnitee shall notify the Company promptly in writing upon being   served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint, indictment, request or other document   relating to any Proceeding which may result in the right to indemnification or the advance of   Expenses hereunder and shall include with such notice a description of the nature of the   Proceeding and a summary of the facts underlying the Proceeding.  The failure to give any such   notice shall not disqualify Indemnitee from the right, or otherwise affect in any manner any right   of Indemnitee, to indemnification or the advance of Expenses under this Agreement unless the      

-9-   Company s ability to defend in such Proceeding or to obtain proceeds under any insurance policy   is materially and adversely prejudiced thereby, and then only to the extent the Company is   thereby actually so prejudiced.   (b) Subject to the provisions of the last sentence of this Section 13(b) and of   Section 13(c) below, the Company shall have the right to defend Indemnitee in any Proceeding   which may give rise to indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that the Company shall   notify Indemnitee of any such decision to defend within 15 calendar days following receipt of   notice of any such Proceeding under Section 13(a) above.  The Company shall not, without the   prior written consent of Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,   consent to the entry of any judgment against Indemnitee or enter into any settlement or   compromise which (i) includes an admission of fault of Indemnitee, (ii) does not include, as an   unconditional term thereof, the full release of Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such   Proceeding, which release shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee,   or (iii) would impose any Expense, judgment, fine, penalty or limitation on Indemnitee.  This   Section 13(b) shall not apply to a Proceeding brought by Indemnitee under Section 12 of this   Agreement.   (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13(b) above, if in a Proceeding   to which Indemnitee is a party by reason of Indemnitee s Corporate Status, (i) Indemnitee   reasonably concludes, based upon an opinion of counsel approved by the Company, which   approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, that Indemnitee may have separate defenses or   counterclaims to assert with respect to any issue which may not be consistent with other   defendants in such Proceeding, (ii) Indemnitee reasonably concludes, based upon an opinion of   counsel approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, that an   actual or apparent conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists between Indemnitee   and the Company, or (iii) if the Company fails to assume the defense of such Proceeding in a   timely manner, Indemnitee shall be entitled to be represented by separate legal counsel of   Indemnitee s choice, subject to the prior approval of the Company, which approval shall not be   unreasonably withheld, at the expense of the Company.  In addition, if the Company fails to   comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event that the Company or any   other person takes any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any   Proceeding to deny or to recover from Indemnitee the benefits intended to be provided to   Indemnitee hereunder, Indemnitee shall have the right to retain counsel of Indemnitee s choice,   subject to the prior approval of the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably   withheld, at the expense of the Company (subject to Section 12(d) of this Agreement), to   represent Indemnitee in connection with any such matter.   Section 14. Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Subrogation.   (a) The rights of indemnification and advance of Expenses as provided by this   Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any   time be entitled under applicable law, the charter or Bylaws of the Company, any agreement or a   resolution of the stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or of the   Board of Directors, or otherwise.  Unless consented to in writing by Indemnitee, no amendment,   alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right   of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee      

-10-   in his or her Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal, regardless of   whether a claim with respect to such action or inaction is raised prior or subsequent to such   amendment, alteration or repeal.  No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive   of any other right or remedy, and every other right or remedy shall be cumulative and in addition   to every other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or   otherwise.  The assertion of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prohibit the   concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.   (b) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be   subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall   execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including   execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce   such rights.   Section 15. Insurance.  The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to acquire   directors and officers liability insurance, on terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the   Board of Directors, with the advice of counsel, covering Indemnitee or any claim made against   Indemnitee by reason of his or her Corporate Status and covering the Company for any   indemnification or advance of Expenses made by the Company to Indemnitee for any claims   made against Indemnitee by reason of his or her Corporate Status.  Without in any way limiting   any other obligation under this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee for any   payment by Indemnitee arising out of the amount of any deductible or retention and the amount   of any excess of the aggregate of all judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and Expenses   incurred by Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding over the coverage of any insurance   referred to in the previous sentence.  The purchase, establishment and maintenance of any such   insurance shall not in any way limit or affect the rights or obligations of the Company or   Indemnitee under this Agreement except as expressly provided herein, and the execution and   delivery of this Agreement by the Company and Indemnitee shall not in any way limit or affect   the rights or obligations of the Company under any such insurance policies.  If, at the time the   Company receives notice from any source of a Proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party or a   participant (as a witness or otherwise), the Company has director and officer liability insurance   in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of such Proceeding to the insurers in accordance   with the procedures set forth in the respective policies.   Section 16. Coordination of Payments.  The Company shall not be liable under this   Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable or payable or reimbursable   as Expenses hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such   payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.   Section 17. Reports to Stockholders.  To the extent required by the MGCL, the   Company shall report in writing to its stockholders the payment of any amounts for   indemnification of, or advance of Expenses to, Indemnitee under this Agreement arising out of a   Proceeding by or in the right of the Company with the notice of the meeting of stockholders of   the Company next following the date of the payment of any such indemnification or advance of   Expenses or prior to such meeting.      

-11-   Section 18. Duration of Agreement; Binding Effect.   (a) This Agreement shall continue until and terminate on the later of   (i) the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a director, officer, employee or agent of   the Company or as a director, trustee, officer, partner, manager, managing member, fiduciary,   employee or agent of any other foreign or domestic corporation, real estate investment trust,   partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other   enterprise that such person is or was serving in such capacity at the request of the Company and   (ii) the date that Indemnitee is no longer subject to any actual or possible Proceeding (including   any rights of appeal thereto and any Proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section   12 of this Agreement).   (b) The indemnification and advance of Expenses provided by, or granted   pursuant to, this Agreement shall be binding upon and be enforceable by the parties hereto and   their respective successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase,   merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the   Company), shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee   or agent of the Company or a director, trustee, officer, partner, manager, managing member,   fiduciary, employee or agent of any other foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, limited   liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise that such person   is or was serving in such capacity at the request of the Company, and shall inure to the benefit of   Indemnitee and Indemnitee s spouse, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and administrators and   other legal representatives.   (c) The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or   indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all or a substantial   part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance   satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same   manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such   succession had taken place.   (d) The Company and Indemnitee agree that a monetary remedy for breach of   this Agreement, at some later date, may be inadequate, impracticable and difficult of proof, and   further agree that such breach may cause Indemnitee irreparable harm.  Accordingly, the parties   hereto agree that Indemnitee may enforce this Agreement by seeking injunctive relief and/or   specific performance hereof, without any necessity of showing actual damage or irreparable   harm and that by seeking injunctive relief and/or specific performance, Indemnitee shall not be   precluded from seeking or obtaining any other relief to which Indemnitee may be entitled.    Indemnitee shall further be entitled to such specific performance and injunctive relief, including   temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, without the   necessity of posting bonds or other undertakings in connection therewith.  The Company   acknowledges that, in the absence of a waiver, a bond or undertaking may be required of   Indemnitee by a court, and the Company hereby waives any such requirement of such a bond or   undertaking.   Section 19. Severability.  If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be   held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:  (a) the validity, legality      

-12-   and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation,   each portion of any Section, paragraph or sentence of this Agreement containing any such   provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself invalid, illegal or   unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable   to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed   to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent   of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement   (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section, paragraph or sentence of this   Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not   itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent   manifested thereby.   Section 20. Identical Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more   counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original but all of which   together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.  One such counterpart signed by the party   against whom enforceability is sought shall be sufficient to evidence the existence of this   Agreement.   Section 21. Headings.  The headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted   for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Agreement or to affect the   construction thereof.   Section 22. Modification and Waiver.  No supplement, modification or amendment of   this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.  No   waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of   any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing   waiver.   Section 23. Notices.  All notices, requests, demands and other communications   hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if (i) delivered by   hand and receipted for by the party to whom said notice or other communication shall have been   directed, on the day of such delivery, or (ii) mailed by certified or registered mail with postage   prepaid, on the third business day after the date on which it is so mailed:   (a) If to Indemnitee, to the address set forth on the signature page hereto.

-13-   Section 24. Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and   enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to its conflicts of   laws rules.

Exhibit 10.4      EXHIBIT A   AFFIRMATION AND UNDERTAKING TO REPAY EXPENSES ADVANCED   To:  The Board of Directors of Realty Finance Trust, Inc.       Re:  Affirmation and Undertaking      Ladies and Gentlemen:      This Affirmation and Undertaking is being provided pursuant to that certain   Indemnification Agreement, dated the [   ] day of [   ] 20[   ], by and between Realty Finance   Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the  Company ), and the undersigned Indemnitee (the    Indemnification Agreement ), pursuant to which I am entitled to advance of Expenses in   connection with [Description of Proceeding] (the  Proceeding ).

           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):
