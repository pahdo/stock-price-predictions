EXPLANATORY NOTE             This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A (this  Amendment ) amends the Quarterly Report of Debt Resolve, Inc. (the  Company ) on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 22, 2016 (the  Original Filing ). This Amendment is being filed for the purpose of restating the Company s balance sheet to correct an accounting error in the classification of accounts receivable, as described in Note 15 to the financial statements. We have not updated the information contained herein for events occurring subsequent to August 22, 2016, the filing date of the Original Filing.            The following Items have been amended as a result of this restatement:                                 Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                          Part II, Item 6, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules                 During the preparation of its financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company identified errors in the presentation of its accounts receivable reported as of June 30, 2016. Based on the Company s reassessment of relevant accounting guidelines, it has corrected the error and characterized a portion of accounts receivable as a long term asset, rather than a current asset. The effect of these adjustments is a reclassification of $2,465,397 of reported accounts receivable as a long term asset. There was no change to any other asset or liability accounts. There was no effect on the Statements of Stockholders  Deficiency, Operations or Cash Flows.         The following tables show the principal financial statement line items originally reported and restatement adjustments as of June 30, 2016:                     The above accounts receivable is reported, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,042,633.

                DEBT RESOLVE, INC.     NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     JUNE 30, 2016       NOTE 1   BASIS AND BUSINESS PRESENTATION      Debt Resolve, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 21, 1997. The Company offers its service as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, enabling clients to introduce this collection or payment software option with no modifications to their existing collections computer systems. Its products capitalize on using the Internet as a tool for communication, resolution, settlement and payment of delinquent or defaulted consumer debt and as part of a complete accounts receivable management solution for consumer creditors.     In December 2014, the Company, jointly with LSH, LLC, organized Progress Advocates LLC, a Delaware limited liability company for the purpose to provide services in the student loan document preparation industry with ownership interests of 51% and 49% for the Company and LSH, LLC, respectively.      In February 2016, the Company, jointly with Patient Online Services, LLC, organized Payment Resolution Systems LLC, a Delaware limited liability company for the purpose of assisting Medical Groups and Hospitals in the online negotiation and settlement of delinquent accounts, with ownership interests of 51% and 49% for the Company and Patient Online Services, LLC, respectively.      In May 2016, the Company, jointly with Hutton Ventures LLC, organized Student Loan Care LLC, a Delaware limited liability company for the purpose of providing document preparation services for holders of Federal Direct Student Loans, with ownership interests of 51% and 49% for the Company and Hutton Ventures LLC, respectively.      The Company operates Payment Resolution Systems within Debt Resolve, Inc., whereas Progress Advocates LLC and Student Loan Care LLC operate as independent subsidiaries.       Basis of Presentation      These unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to the Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and therefore, do not include all the information necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.     In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated December 31, 2015 financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiary. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The non-controlling interest represents the minority owners' share of its net operating results.                 8

              DEBT RESOLVE, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    JUNE 30, 2016       NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the presentation of the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements follows:      Revenue Recognition      In recognition of the principles expressed in Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned, and given the element of doubt associated with collectability of an agreed settlement on past due debt, the Company postpones recognition of all contingent revenue until the client receives payment from the debtor. As is required by SAB 104, revenues are considered to have been earned when the Company has substantially accomplished the agreed-upon deliverables to be entitled to payment by the client. For most current active clients, these deliverables consist of the successful collection of past due debts using the Company's system and/or, for clients under a flat fee arrangement, the successful availability of the Company's system to its customers.      Revenues for the preparation of student loan documentation are earned when the Company has substantially accomplished the agreed-upon deliverables to be entitled to payment by the client. For most current active clients, these deliverables consist of the completed, delivered and accepted student loan package by the Department of Education and subsequent yearly re-certifications to DoE. The Company may sell its products separately or in various bundles that include multiple elements such as initial fees, monitoring, re-certification, and other services.     The Company also earns revenue from collection agencies, healthcare providers and lenders that implemented our online system. The Company's current contracts provide for revenue based on a percentage of the amount of debt collected, a fee per settlement or through a flat monthly fee. Although other revenue models have been proposed, most revenue earned to date has been determined using these methods, and such revenue is recognized when the settlement amount of debt is collected by the client or at the beginning of the month for a flat fee. While the percent of debt collected will continue to be a revenue recognition method going forward, other payment models are also being offered to clients. Dependent upon the structure of future contracts, revenue may be derived from a combination of set up fees or flat monthly or annual fees with transaction fees upon debt settlement, fees per account loaded or fees per settlement.      Payment Resolution Systems, the Company's 51% owned subsidiary, works as an extended business office to medical groups around the U.S. Revenue is earned in this business by the online negotiations and collection of group's accounts receivable and paid via a service fee.     Revenues for set-up fees, percentage contingent collection fees, fixed settlement fees, monthly fees, etc. are accounted for as Multiple-Element Arrangements under ASC 605-10 which incorporates Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements ("ASC 605-25"). ASC 605-25 addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets.     The Company defers any revenue for which the product or service has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had deferred revenues of $1,038,984 and $1,260,137, respectively      Estimates      The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and certain disclosures. The most significant estimates are those used in determination of the carrying value of accounts receivable, revenue recognition, derivative liabilities and stock compensation. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.                 9

                DEBT RESOLVE, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    JUNE 30, 2016       Concentrations and Credit Risk      The Company extends credit to large, mid-size and small companies for the use of its software solutions along with customers in the student loan industry. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have an accounts receivable concentration and no sales concentrations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.      Net Loss per Common Share, basic and diluted      The Company computes earnings (loss) per share under Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share ("ASC 260-10"). Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the "treasury stock" and/or "if converted" methods as applicable.     The computation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share as of June 30, 2016 excludes potentially dilutive securities when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or if their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common stock during the period.      Potentially dilutive securities as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:            Reclassification      Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period's data to conform to the current period's presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported income or losses.      Stock-based compensation      The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded by the Company in the same expense classifications in the statements of operations, as if such amounts were paid in cash. As of June 30, 2016, there were outstanding stock options to purchase 17,742,434 shares of common stock, 14,592,434 shares of which were vested.               DEBT RESOLVE, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    JUNE 30, 2016       Defined Contribution (401k) Plan      The Company maintains a defined contribution (401k) plan for our employees. The plan provides for a company match in the amount of 100% of the first 3% of pre-tax salary contributed and 50% of the next 3% of pre-tax salary contributed. Due to the severe cash limitations that the Company has experienced, the match was suspended from mid-2008 to the present and will only be re-instated when business conditions warrant.      Derivative Liability      The Company accounts for derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges. See Note 10 for discussion of the Company's derivative liabilities.      Recent accounting pronouncements      There were various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.       NOTE 3   LIQUIDITY      The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $1,029,348 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Additionally, the Company has negative working capital (total current liabilities exceeded total current assets) of   $10,697,370   as of June 30, 2016. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.      The Company has undertaken further steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and beyond to address its lack of liquidity by raising additional funds, either in the form of debt or equity or some combination thereof. However, there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully accomplish these steps and or business plans, and it is uncertain that the Company will achieve a profitable level of operations and be able to obtain additional financing.     The Company's continued existence is dependent upon management's ability to develop profitable operations and resolve its liquidity problems. There can be no assurance that any additional financings will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. In the event that the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, it may elect or be required to seek protection from its creditors by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy.     The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.              DEBT RESOLVE, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    JUNE 30, 2016       NOTE 4   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DUE TO FACTOR      Accounts receivable are receivables generated from sales to customers and progress billings on performance type contracts. Amounts included in accounts receivable are deemed to be collectible within the Company's operating cycle. Management provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company's historical losses, specific customer circumstances, and general economic conditions. Periodically, management reviews accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance based on current circumstances and charges off uncollectible receivables when all attempts to collect have been exhausted and the prospects for recovery are remote. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's accounts receivable was $4,747,619 and $4,063,161, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,042,633 and $600,000, respectively.     The Company's majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC entered into a factoring agreement which had certain provisions that factor advances were based on either a non-recourse and recourse basis. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company agreed to modify the terms of the factoring agreement whereby the outstanding advances which were originally based upon a non-recourse basis will be reclassified to a full recourse advances. Accordingly, the Company reclassified the outstanding advances of $1,128,701 to a full recourse liability to the factor, increased the carrying value of accounts receivable by $1,128,701, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $212,388.     The recourse agreement provides for the Company to receive an advance of between 30% - 96% of any accounts receivable that it factors with 62% - 0% held in reserve. The average amount received from these recourse agreements was 50.9% and the average amount reserved was 42.1%. The factoring agreement also provides for discount fees of 4% - 8% of the face value of any accounts receivable factored, plus additional charges for other transaction fees. The agreement may be terminated by either party at any time and will continue unless either party formally cancels. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's outstanding obligation under the factoring agreement was $3,090,613 and $2,442,935, respectively.      The Company's majority owned subsidiary, Student Loan Care LLC, entered into a similar recourse factoring agreement during the second quarter of 2016.      NOTE 5   ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES      Accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are comprised of the following:           On April 19, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the former Chief Executive officer whereby the Company issued a convertible note for $75,000 and 2,225,000 warrants to purchase the Company's common stock at $0.10 per share for three years as part settlement of the outstanding salary due of $153,750. The remaining balance is to be paid monthly installments of $2,500 to the extent of available cash flows as determined by the Board of Directors. (See Note 7)              DEBT RESOLVE, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    JUNE 30, 2016       NOTE 6   NOTES PAYABLE      As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, short term notes are as follows:            On January 13, 2016, the Company issued an unsecured note payable for $50,000 due January 1, 2017 with interest at 12% per annum, paid monthly beginning May 2016 and principal payments beginning November 2016. The outstanding balance as of June 30, 2016 is $50,000.

In connection with the issuance of the convertible note, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,225,000 warrants to purchase the Company's common stock at $0.10 per share over three years.      The Company has identified the embedded derivatives related to the convertible note dated May 15, 2016 (See Note 10). These embedded derivatives included certain conversion features. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of the Notes and to fair value as of each subsequent reporting date.      At inception of the May 15, 2016 note, the Company determined the aggregate fair value of $73,697 of embedded derivatives. The fair value of the embedded derivatives was determined using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of 0%; (2) expected volatility of 336.12%, (3) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 0.55%, (4) expected life from 2 years, and (5) estimated fair value of the Company's common stock of $0.02 per share. The determined fair value of the debt derivatives of $73,697 was charged as a debt discount of the note. In addition, the Company recognized the value attributable to the warrants, up to the remaining net proceeds of $1,303 to additional paid in capital and a discount against the notes. The Company valued the warrants in accordance with ASC 470-20 using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions: contractual terms of 3 years, a risk free interest rate of 0.91%, a dividend yield of 0%, and volatility of 336.12%.

Interest will also be converted into common stock at the conversion rate of $0.05 per share. In addition, if the Company issues any of its common stock or any security convertible into its common stock at an exercise or conversion price lower than the stated conversion price, then the stated conversion price is reduced to the lower conversion price.     After February 1, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of $200,000 in secured convertible notes that mature two years from the date of issuance (from January 2018 through June 2018). The notes bear interest at a rate of 10% and can be convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, at a conversion rate of $0.02 per share.

The debt discount attributed to the value of the warrants and conversion feature issued is amortized over the note's maturity period (two years) as interest expense.     After February 1, 2016, the Company has identified the embedded derivatives related to the notes issued after January 31, 2016. These embedded derivatives included certain conversion features. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of the Notes and to fair value as of each subsequent reporting date.      At inception of the post January 2016 notes, the Company determined the aggregate fair value of $244,304 of embedded derivatives. The fair value of the embedded derivatives was determined using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of 0%; (2) expected volatility from 323.14% to 348.27%, (3) weighted average risk-free interest rate from of 0.40% to 0.76%, (4) expected life from 1 to 2 years, and (5) estimated fair value of the Company's common stock of $0.01 to $0.02 per share. The determined fair value of the debt derivatives of $244,304 was charged as a debt discount of the note. In addition, the Company recognized the value attributable to the warrants, up to the remaining net proceeds of $8,181 to additional paid in capital and a discount against the notes. The Company valued the warrants in accordance with ASC 470-20 using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions: contractual terms of 3 years, a risk free interest rate of 0.87% to 0.92%, a dividend yield of 0%, and volatility of 330.45% to 348.10%. The debt discount attributed to the value of the warrants and conversion feature issued is amortized over the note's maturity period (two years) as interest expense.      Certain convertible note holders, representing an aggregate of $524,500 of these notes, entered into agreements in in May and June 2016 whereby their obligations were extended from May 2018 through August 2018. The terms of the agreement included extension of previously issued warrants in connection with the debt by two years and reducing the exercise price from $0.15 per share to $0.10 per share to certain note holders. All other terms (including any amendments or earlier extensions) of the notes remain the same.      The determined change in fair value of the extended and repriced warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes Pricing Model based on the following assumptions: (1) dividend yield of 0%; (2) expected volatility of 322.74% to 329.59%, (3) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 0.43%, (4) expected life from 0.65 to 1.02 years, and (5) estimated fair value of the Company's common stock of $0.018 to 0.03 per share.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    JUNE 30, 2016       NOTE 10   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES      As described in Note 9, the Company has identified the embedded derivatives related to the notes issued after January 31, 2016. These embedded derivatives included certain conversion features. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of the Notes and to fair value as of each subsequent reporting date.      The Company recognizes its derivative liabilities as level 3 and values its derivatives using the methods discussed below. While the Company believes that its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, it recognizes that the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The primary assumptions that would significantly affect the fair values using the methods discussed are that of volatility and market price of the underlying common stock of the Company.      At June 30, 2016, the fair value of the derivative liabilities of $164,782 was determined using the Black Scholes Option Pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield: 0%; volatility: 333.89%; risk free rate: 0.59% to 0.36 to 0.58%; and expected life: 0.59 to 1.94 years.     As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.     The derivative liability as of June 30, 2016, in the amount of $164,782 has a level 3 classification.     The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company's Level 3 financial liabilities as of June 30, 2016:           Fluctuations in the Company's stock price are a primary driver for the changes in the derivative valuations during each reporting period. The Company's stock price decreased by 50% from February 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016. As the stock price decreases for each of the related derivative instruments, the value to the holder of the instrument generally decreases, therefore decreasing the liability on the Company's balance sheet. Additionally, stock price volatility is one of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of each of the Company's derivative instruments.            DEBT RESOLVE, INC.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION   ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Overview       Business Growth Strategy Update      During the quarter ending June 30, 2016, significant progress was made in the implementation of our new strategies. While individual setbacks were expected and did occur, each was addressed and positive momentum resumed for the respective strategy. The following is a brief review of the important progress achieved in each strategy:                       An important transition in our federal student loan document preparation business took place in the quarter ending June 30, 2016.  As previously reported in both the Company's 2015 form 10-K and form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31,2016, the Company suspended all marketing and sales activities during the first quarter of 2016. After continued discussions with our joint venture partner who was also the operator of Progress Advocates, the Company reached the conclusion that the changes necessary to reach profitability were not going to be made by our partner. By the beginning of 2016, it was evident that high marketing and sales costs, along with a higher than expected default of customer payments, resulted in a business cost structure that was unsupported by current revenues. Progress Advocates will continue to support its current customers and provide to them all contracted services.                         Using the knowledge gained in the Company's involvement with Progress Advocates, Student Loan Care LLC was formed and started its operations in June, 2016.  This new joint venture is a partnership with Hutton Ventures LLC., a California based company with extensive experience in the federal student loan document preparation industry. The business model for Student Loan Care, specifically addresses the issues of high marketing costs and customer churn. The new business was soft launched on June 1, 2016. Early results support the Company's proforma for this business. In contrast to Progress Advocates, Student Loan Care has reduced the cost per lead and increased the lead conversion rate, thereby initially reducing cost per customer acquisition by 35%. In addition, Student Loan Care is initiating customer retention program immediately upon customer signup. In other industries this technique has proven to successfully reduce customer churn.                         Enhance the Debt Resolve Solution by integrating it with other services to become a total solution for the ARM market.  As vast as the ARM market has become, this strategy has been narrowed to focus on the needs of hospitals and medical practices. In March 2016, a new joint venture, Payment Resolution Systems LLC was formed with Patient Online Services, LLC, a company whose partners are experienced in providing billing and collections services to the healthcare industry. Payment Resolution Systems offers a service to Medical Practices and Hospitals looking to give patients with unpaid accounts one last chance to pay. The one last chance will be a negotiated settlement offering using Debt Resolve's patented double blind bidding technology. A pilot of this business was run in March and April of 2016 with a NYC Anesthesiology practice. The results were better than expected and a second pilot was run for an Atlanta GA Anesthesiology Group. This effort confirmed our initial results and demonstrated our ability to negotiate settlements for high and low account balances. A national sales effort has been initiated. The second service offering, a billing and collections system for a company financing hospital patient receivables, is currently under consideration. Again, the Debt Resolve service will provide collection support throughout the life of the patient's loan, including negotiated delinquency collection. In addition to the above new offerings, the traditional Debt Resolve service, was renamed Settl.it Enterprise and is the core offering in a new U.K. joint venture, Settlit Ltd.                           Leverage our technology and knowledge of consumer debt collection to launch a new internet based product in the consumer to consumer debt resolution and collection space.  This new product launched under the name Settl.it (www.settl.it) is currently available, but not being aggressively marketed. The cost of an expansive launch of Settl.it is currently unfeasible. Therefore, a targeted launch is underway focused on consumers looking for small claims courts alternatives and on State Small Claims Courts looking for a tool to offload some of the cost of face to face adjudication. However, field research found bigger demand for a small business product with capabilities similar to the traditional Debt Resolve service, now named the Settl.it Enterprise Service, and a user interface as easy to use as Settl.it. This new product, Settl.it Pro is currently under development. In addition, an online mediation company has white labeled Settl.it from us and completed the integration of Settl.it into their product, Equisettle, www.equisettle.com. Other online application providers have also approached us and we are working with an additional provider to integrate Settle.it into their product as well.                                Leverage our public equity financial structure by purchasing equity interests in private companies that will benefit from the experience and skills of our management and consultants as well as from holding our publicly traded equity.  During the second quarter of 2016, , Student Loan Care LLC was formed with Hutton Ventures LLC to offer document preparation services for Federal student loan holders wanting to apply for various U.S. Department of Education Student loan payment modification programs. The principles of Hutton Ventures are experienced in the federal student loan document preparation industry and in the use of advanced communications techniques to increase productivity and profitability in a traditional people based business environment. To reward their successful participation in Student Loan Care, goals for Student Loan Care revenue growth and net profit attainment have been established. Hutton Venture will be granted warrants for Debt Resolve common stock upon the attainment of each of these goals.      To communicate and support the above strategies, we created a new branding strategy to unify our offerings and position us as "a provider of cloud-based software and services to help both lenders and borrowers solve the problems inherent in our credit-based economy". To start, we unified our offerings under the Settl.it Family of Products. For medium and large companies, we offer the Settl.it Enterprise Service. For small businesses, we will be offering Settl.it Pro, with an easy to-use online interface and much of the functionality of the Enterprise service. For consumers, we have launched Settl.it, an easy-to-use online consumer to consumer financial dispute resolution tool. All three of these products utilize our patented double blind bidding technology. To communicate our offerings, we have launched a new investor focused Debt Resolve website, www.debtresolve.com, and new prospective client focused websites; Settl.it Family of Products website, www.settl.com, and Payment Resolution Systems, www.paymentresolutionsustems.com. In addition, the Settl.it consumer to consumer product can be utilized at www.settl.it and our Progress Advocates federal student loan document preparation services can be obtained at www.progressadvocates.com.           Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015        Revenues       Revenues totaled $347,830 and $1,439,674 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We earned revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 as a percent of debt collected, on a fee per settlement and on a flat monthly fee basis. In addition, we earn revenue from fees for providing student loan document preparation services. The decreased revenue mainly resulted from our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC of $211,743 for the three month ending June 30, 2016 as compared to $1,412,604 for the same period last year.       Costs and Expenses        Payroll and related expenses.  Payroll and related expenses amounted to $300,912 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $484,254 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of $183,342. Stock based compensation was $107,359 and $10,829 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease mainly resulted from our staffing reductions from our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC from $353,650 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $22,500 for the same period, current year       Selling and marketing expenses.  Selling and marketing expenses decreased from $567,800 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $-0- for the same period in 2016. The significant decrease is due to the reduced sales and marketing activities of Progress Advocates LLC., our majority owned subsidiary.       General and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses amounted to $458,585 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $109,955 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $348,630. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the most significant expense incurred by Progress Advocates were from bad debt reserves.      Gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities.  In 2016, we issued convertible promissory notes with certain embedded derivatives, as such, any issued convertible instruments issued subsequent require us to fair value the conversion feature as derivatives each reporting period and mark to market as a non-cash adjustment to our current period operations. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred a $157,458 gain on change in fair value of our derivative liabilities.            During the three months June 30, 2015, we had the possibility of exceeding common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares that may be issuable to satisfy settlement provisions of these agreements after consideration of all existing instruments that could be settled in shares. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires us to reclassify the derivative from equity to a liability at their fair values as of the date possible issuable shares exceeded the authorized level and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a gain on change in fair value of these derivative liabilities of $267,532.      Interest (expense).  We recorded interest expense of $197,240 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to interest expense of $541,225 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Interest expense decreased primarily from our reduced financing of accounts receivable with Progressive Advocates.      Amortization of deferred debt discount.  Amortization expense of $52,771 and $22,404 was incurred for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the amortization of the value of the deferred debt discount associated with certain of our notes payable. Amortization expense increased due to new notes added in 2015 and 2016.      Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015        Revenues       Revenues totaled $1,005,474 and $1,909,767 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We earned revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 as a percent of debt collected, on a fee per settlement and on a flat monthly fee basis. In addition, we earn revenue from fees for providing student loan document preparation services. The decreased revenue mainly resulted from our majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC of $839,464 for the six month ending June 30, 2016 as compared to $1,795,632 for the same period last year. As noted above, this reduction in revenue was a result of suspending the new sales operations of Progress Advocates in February, 2016.        Costs and Expenses        Payroll and related expenses.  Payroll and related expenses amounted to $615,566 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $822,458 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of $206,892. Stock based compensation was $154,079 and $18,205 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Selling and marketing expenses decreased from $926,600 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $124,500 for the same period in 2016. The significant decrease is due to the reduced sales and marketing activities of Progress Advocates LLC., our majority owned subsidiary.       General and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses amounted to $1,200,133 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $499,762 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $700,371. Of the increase, $925,292 was incurred from our subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC, in the current year, as compared to $166,572 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the most significant expense incurred by Progress Advocates were from bad debt reserves.      Gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities.  In 2016, we issued convertible promissory notes with certain embedded derivatives, as such, any issued convertible instruments issued subsequent require us to fair value the conversion feature as derivatives each reporting period and mark to market as a non-cash adjustment to our current period operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred a $153,218 gain on change in fair value of our derivative liabilities.             During the six months June 30, 2015, we had the possibility of exceeding common shares authorized when considering the number of possible shares that may be issuable to satisfy settlement provisions of these agreements after consideration of all existing instruments that could be settled in shares. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires us to reclassify the derivative from equity to a liability at their fair values as of the date possible issuable shares exceeded the authorized level and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a gain on change in fair value of these derivative liabilities of $340,831.      Interest (expense).  We recorded interest expense of $448,949 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to interest expense of $648,801 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Interest expense increased primarily from our financing of accounts receivable with Progressive Advocates.      Amortization of deferred debt discount.  Amortization expense of $83,010 and $41,976 was incurred for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the amortization of the value of the deferred debt discount associated with certain of our notes payable. Amortization expense increased due to new notes added in 2015 and 2016.      Liquidity and Capital Resources       As of June 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficiency (total current liabilities exceeded total current assets) in the amount of   $10,697,370   and cash and cash equivalents totaling $59,250. We reported a net loss of $1,029,348 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $46,101 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Cash flow provided by financing activities was $74,871 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficiency (total current liabilities exceeded total current assets) in the amount of   $10,313,663   and cash and cash equivalents totaling $30,480.     Our working capital as of the date of this report is negative and is not sufficient to fund our plan of operations for the next year. The aforementioned factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.     We have successfully raised capital for our day-to-day operations since our inception; however, no assurance can be provided that we will continue to be able to do so. There is no assurance that any funds secured will be sufficient to enable us to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that we are unsuccessful, we may need to curtail our operations and implement a plan to extend payables and reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. At any time until substantial capital is raised or we reach cash flow breakeven, there is also a significant risk of bankruptcy. There can be no assurance that any plan to raise additional funding will be successful. It is quite challenging in the current environment to raise money given our delay in generating meaningful revenue. Unless our revenue grows quickly, it may not be possible to demonstrate the progress investors require to secure additional funding. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.      Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are based on our management's judgment and available information and, consequently, actual results could be different from these estimates. The significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are as follows:      Revenue Recognition      We earn revenue from collection agencies, collection law firms and lenders that implemented our online system. Our current contracts provide for revenue based on a percentage of the amount of debt collected, a fee per settlement or through a flat monthly fee. Although other revenue models have been proposed, most revenue earned to date has been determined using these methods, and such revenue is recognized when the settlement amount of debt is collected by the client or at the beginning of the month for a flat fee. For the early adopters of our product, we have waived set-up fees and other transactional fees that we anticipate charging in the future. While the percent of debt collected will continue to be a revenue recognition method going forward, other payment models are also being offered to clients and may possibly become our preferred revenue model. Dependent upon the structure of future contracts, revenue may be derived from a combination of set up fees or flat monthly or annual fees with transaction fees upon debt settlement, fees per account loaded or fees per settlement. We are currently marketing our system to three primary markets. The first and second are financial institutions and collection agencies or law firms, our traditional markets. We are also expanding into healthcare, particularly hospitals, which is our third market.           Revenues for the preparation of student loan documentation are earned when the Company has substantially accomplished the agreed-upon deliverables to be entitled to payment by the client. For most current active clients, these deliverables consist of the completion and delivery of the student loan modification and consolidation documentation package on behalf of the client to the U.S. Department of Education. The Company may sell its products separately or in various bundles that include multiple elements such as initial fees, monitoring, annual renewals and other services.     We defer any revenue for which the product or service has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.       Accounts Receivable      Accounts receivable are receivables generated from sales to customers and progress billings on performance type contracts. Amounts included in accounts receivable are deemed to be collectible within the Company's operating cycle. Management provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company's historical losses, specific customer circumstances, and general economic conditions. Periodically, management reviews accounts receivable and adjusts the allowance based on current circumstances and charges off uncollectible receivables when all attempts to collect have been exhausted and the prospects for recovery are remote.      As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's accounts receivable was $3,704,986 and $3,463,161, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,042,633 and $600,000, respectively.     The Company's majority owned subsidiary, Progress Advocates LLC entered into a factoring agreement which had certain provisions that factor advances were based on either a non-recourse and recourse basis. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company agreed to modify the terms of the factoring agreement whereby the outstanding advances which were originally based upon a non-recourse basis will be reclassified to a full recourse advances. Accordingly, the Company reclassified the outstanding advances of $1,128,701 to a full recourse liability to the factor, increased the carrying value of accounts receivable by $1,128,701, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $212,388.      Stock-based compensation      We follow Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 718-10, Stock-based Compensation ("ASC 718-10"). The standards require the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee's requisite service period.      Fair Values      Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825-10") requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term borrowings, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed.     We follow Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820-10") and Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825-10"), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. None of these statements had an impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.            Derivative Liability      We account for derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.      Recently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements      See recently adopted and issued accounting standards in "Note 2 Significant accounting policies" in Item 1. Financial statements of this report.      Statement Relating to Forward-Looking Statements      This report contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions and information currently available to us. When used in this report, the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "potential" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties concerning our recent research and development activities; the risks and uncertainties concerning acceptance of our services and products, if and when fully developed, by our potential customers; our present financial condition and the risks and uncertainties concerning the availability of additional capital as and when required; the risks and uncertainties concerning the Limited License Agreement with Messrs. Brofman and Burchetta; the risks and uncertainties concerning our dependence on our key executives; the risks and uncertainties concerning technological changes and the competition for our services and products; the risks and uncertainties concerning general economic conditions; and the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on April 14, 2016, in the section labeled "Risk Factors." Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, all of which speak only as of the date of this report.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Not applicable.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Disclosure Controls and Procedures      We evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether they are effective in ensuring that we disclose required information in a timely manner and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Our Chief Executive Officer has participated in such evaluation. Management concluded, based on such review, that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The ineffectiveness of these disclosure controls is due to the matters described below in "Internal Control over Financial Reporting."      Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls      We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our Chief Executive Officer has concluded that such controls and procedures are not effective at the "reasonable assurance" level. The ineffectiveness of these disclosure controls is due to the matters described below in "Internal Control over Financial Reporting."            Internal Control over Financial Reporting      Segregation of duties within our Company is limited due to the small number of employees that are assigned to positions that involve the processing of financial information. Specifically, certain key financial accounting and reporting personnel had an expansive scope of duties that allowed for the creation, review, approval and processing of financial data without independent review and authorization for preparation of consolidation schedules and resulting financial statements and related disclosures. We did not maintain a sufficient depth of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the selection and application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles commensurate with financial reporting requirements.      Accordingly, we place undue reliance on the finance team at corporate headquarters, specifically the executive who is our Chief Executive Officer and outside accounting professionals.      Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. This material weakness could result in material misstatements of significant accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. In addition, due to limited staffing, we are not always able to detect minor errors or omissions in reporting.     Going forward, management anticipates that additional staff will be necessary to mitigate these weaknesses, as well as to implement other planned improvements. Additional staff will enable us to document and apply transactional and periodic controls procedures, permit a better review and approval process and improve quality of financial reporting. However, the potential addition of new staff is contingent on obtaining additional financing, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.     Management believes that its unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 fairly presented, in all material respects, its financial condition and results of operations. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.             PART II   OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS        Lawsuits from Noteholders      On July 20, 2015, the Company received a complaint concerning a promissory note dated December 21, 2007 that matured on June 21, 2009. See, Commitments and Contingencies Note 13 (Litigation).       Lawsuits from vendors      From time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. There are currently no lawsuits from vendors.      New York State Attorney General Subpoena      In December 2015, the Company and Progress Advocates, its majority owned subsidiary, received a subpoena requesting documents regarding the operations of Progress Advocates. It is our understanding that this request was one of several requests sent to companies operating in the Federal Student Loan document preparation space in New York State. We have provided the requested information that was available, both from Progress Advocates and its vendors. Additional information has been provided subsequent to the Company's initial response. We are confident that our compliance with payments aligned to the consumer's receipt of benefit and our vendor's responsible marketing will be accurately demonstrated in the information provided.        ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS       As a "small reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this item.       ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       None.       ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES       Investor Note 1:     On December 21, 2007, an unaffiliated investor loaned us $125,000 on an unsecured 18-month note with a maturity date of June 21, 2009. The note has a provision requiring repayment once we raised an aggregate of $500,000 following issuance of this note. As a result, this note is currently in default as it has not been repaid and we reached the $500,000 threshold in September, 2008. The note carries interest at a rate of 12% per annum, with interest accruing and payable at maturity. In conjunction with the note, we granted to the investor a warrant to purchase 37,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.07 and an expiration date of December 21, 2012. This note is guaranteed by, a shareholder and former Company director. On April 10, 2008, we borrowed an additional $198,000 from this investor. Please see discussion below.           On April 10, 2008, an unaffiliated investor loaned us an additional $198,000 on an amendment of the prior unsecured note with a maturity date of June 21, 2009 for the entire balance of the first note plus the amendment ($323,000 total). The note carries interest at a rate of 12% per annum, with interest accruing and payable at maturity. The outstanding principal and interest may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time without prepayment penalty. In conjunction with the note, we also issued a warrant to purchase 99,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.45 and an expiration date of April 10, 2013. This warrant has a "cashless" exercise feature. This note is guaranteed by a Director of the Company. The amended note maintains the provision requiring repayment of the note upon raising gross proceeds of $500,000 subsequent the issuance of the note.      At September 30, 2008, we had raised in excess of $500,000 subsequent to this amended note, and as a result, this note is in default. We also issued 50,000 shares of common stock valued at $122,130 in order to induce the investor to forbear on the note, which was included in expenses.      On February 12, 2010, we converted $74,867 of accrued interest through January 2010 and $65,133 of principal on the note to stock.     On August 27, 2010, the investor was paid $80,000 in principal through partial sale of the note, leaving a remaining balance of $177,867 plus accrued interest due on the note as of June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, this note has matured and is still outstanding and is in default at this time.
