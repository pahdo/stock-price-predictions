NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

September 30, 2016 

NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF
PRESENTATION 

Kyto Biopharma, Inc. was formed as a Florida corporation on
March 5, 1999. On August 14, 2002, the Company changed
its name from B Twelve, Inc. to Kyto Biopharma, Inc. 

The Company is a biopharmaceutical company, formed to acquire and
develop innovative minimally toxic and non-immunosuppressive
proprietary drugs for the treatment of cancer, arthritis, and other
proliferate and autoimmune diseases. The Company is currently not
in the development stage and was in  development stage 
till June 30, 2011.     

Activities during the development stage include acquisition of
financing and intellectual properties and research and development
activities conducted by others under contracts. 

USE OF ESTIMATES 

In preparing financial statements, management is required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues
and expenses during the period presented. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. 

Significant estimates during 2016 include depreciable lives on
equipment, valuation of intangible assets, the valuation allowance
of deferred tax assets, and the valuation of non-cash stock based
transactions. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at September 30,
2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.  

CONCENTRATIONS 

The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at
times, may exceed federally insured limits. As of September 30,
2016, the Company did not have any deposits in excess of federally
insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such
accounts through September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016,
respectively. 

The Company has obtained and continues to obtain a large amount of
its funding from loans and equity funding from a principal
stockholder related to a director of the Company. 

NOTE 2   INTERIM REVIEW REPORTING 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of Kyto
Biopharma, Inc. (the "Company") have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures, normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules
and regulations. Nevertheless, the Company believes that the
disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. These interim unaudited condensed financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and notes thereto included in the Company's March 31, 2016 Annual
Report as filed on Form 10K. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments necessary to
present fairly the financial position of the Company with respect
to the interim unaudited condensed financial statements and the
results of its operations for the interim period ended September
30, 2016, have been included. The results of operations for interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full
year.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

September 30, 2016 

NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN 

As reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements, the Company has a working capital deficiency of
$171,256, a deficit accumulated of $32,235,046, and a stockholders'
deficit of $171,256 as of September 30, 2016. The ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the
Company's ability to further implement its business plan, raise
capital, and generate revenues. The unaudited condensed financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern. 

The Company has yet to generate an internal cash flow, and until
the sales of its product begins, the Company is highly dependent
upon debt and equity funding. The Company must successfully
complete its research and development resulting in a saleable
product. However, there is no assurance that once the development
of the product is completed and finally gains Federal Drug and
Administration clearance, that the Company will achieve a
profitable level of operations. 

NOTE
4 - ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES 

Significant
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material
effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements.

respectively. 

NOTE 6    EQUITY

On May
24 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with Comindus

NOTE
7- SUBSEQUENT EVENT 

Management
evaluated all activities of the Company through the issuance date

statements.

ITEM 2.     
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

PLAN OF OPERATION 

The report of our Independent Registered Public Accounting firm
dated June 29, 2016 on our March 31, 2016 financial
statements includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that there
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern due to substantial recurring losses from operations, cash
used in operations, stockholders  deficit, significant
accumulated deficit and working capital deficit. Our ability to
continue as a going concern will be determined by our ability to
obtain additional financing and maintain operations. Currently we
do not have sufficient financial resources to fund our operations.
Therefore, we need additional funds to continue these operations.
The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that
involves a number of factors, some of which are beyond
management s control, such as financial market trends and
investors  appetite for new financings. It should be
emphasized that, should the Company not be successful in completing
its own financing (either by debt or by the issuance of securities
from treasury), the Company may be unable to continue to operate as
a going concern. 

Results of Operations 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 the
Company s net loss attributable to common shareholders
increase by $59 to $19,498 compared to a net loss of $19,439 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

For the six months ended September 30, 2016 the Company s net
loss attributable to common shareholders decreased by $125 to
$39,056 compared to a net loss of $39,181 for the six months ended
September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company had working capital deficits of $171,256 as of
September 30, 2016 and $132,200 as of March 31, 2016. Cash was
$31 as of September 30, 2016 and $32 as of March 31,
2016. 

Cash from operating activities 

The
Company s net cash used in operations decreased by $747 to
$14,215 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net
cash used in operations of $14,962 for the six months ended
September 30, 2015. 

Cash from financing activities 

The Company s net cash flows from financing activities
decreased by $761 to $14,214 for the six months ended September 30,
2016 compared to cash flows from financing activities of $14,975
for the six months ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company s plan of operation for the next twelve months is
to continue to focus its efforts on finding new sources of capital
and on R D activities related to the development and
application of its antibody technologies. As of the date of filing
of this Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Company did receive a commitment of one of its
stockholders to continue to provide operating loan funds to the
Company. 

ITEM 3.     
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK 

Not required for smaller reporting company.

ITEM 4.     
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our
periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our chief executive
officer/chief financial officer (principal financial officer) as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 we carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including the principal executive officer and
the principal financial officer (principal financial officer), of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under
the 1934 Act. Based on this evaluation, because of the
Company s limited resources and limited number of employees,
management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective as of September 30, 2016. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer (principal financial officer), does not expect
that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system,
no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not
limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people, or by management override of the control. The design of any
system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because
of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected. 

Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there have been no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
controls over financial reporting.
