NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS
OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Company Overview  

Premier Holding Corporation (the  Company )
is an energy services holding company. The Company provides an array of energy services through its subsidiary companies, Energy
Efficiency Experts, Inc. ( E3 ) and The Power Company USA, LLC ( TPC ). The Company provides solutions
that enable customers to lower their electricity rates, reduce their energy consumption, lower their operating and maintenance
costs, and realize environmental benefits. The Company s comprehensive set of services includes competitive electricity plans
and upgrades to a facility s energy infrastructure. 

The Company was organized under the laws
of the State of Nevada on October 18, 1971 under the name of Mr. Nevada, Inc. On November 13, 2008, the Company filed a Certificate
of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its name from OVM International Holding
Corporation to Premier Holding Corporation. The Company is organized with a holding company structure such that the Company provides
financial and management expertise, which includes access to capital, financing, legal, insurance, mergers, acquisitions, joint
ventures and management strategies for its subsidiaries. 

In 2012, the Company acquired a unique
marquee technology for energy efficient lighting, the E-Series controller developed by Active ES. This patented technology provides
an upgrade for existing HID lamps for high-bay indoor and outdoor applications where the other then current options for efficiency
were new and untested, and expensive. This technology is being marketed by E3. 

In the first quarter of 2013, the Company
acquired an 80% stake in TPC, a deregulated power broker in Illinois. By the end of that quarter, TPC had over 11,000 clients and
has been adding between 1,000 and 3,000 clients per month. The Company now has sold well over 200,000 residential contract equivalents
( RCEs ) and typically closes over 5,000 contracts per month. TPC has also contracted nearly 5,000 commercial/industrial
clients to date, such as small businesses, warehouses and distribution centers, which are then candidates for E3. 

On October 22, 2014, the Company entered
into a Membership Purchase Agreement ( Agreement ) to acquire 85% of the membership interests of Lexington Power  
Light, LLC ( LP L ) from its owners. LP L was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on July
8, 2010 as a Limited Liability Company. LP L marketed and sold electricity and natural gas to both commercial and residential
customers located primarily in five boroughs of New York City and on Long Island. The Company purchased electricity and natural
gas on a wholesale basis pursuant to a combined supply and credit facility agreement. Under the Agreement, the Company was to acquire
85% of LP L on the closing date for 7,500,000 shares of common stock and $500,000 in Promissory Notes, plus earn-out payments
based upon EBITDA milestones during the 12 months following the closing date. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company had
a contingent funding obligation of $1,000,000 of which $500,000 will be used as working capital for LP L, had the option to
acquire the remaining 15% of LP L until December 31, 2018 for $20,000,000 payable 1/2 in cash and 1/2 in common stock and was
to limit its board of directors to five persons, with the members of LP L having the right to appoint one board member. On
April 7, 2015, the Agreement was terminated as per our default on our purchase obligations for the acquisition due to the non-performance
of LP L under the terms of the Agreement. 

On May 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive
agreement with WWCD, LLC, a company incorporated in the State of Illinois ( WWCD ), to acquire for $125,000 all membership
units, including all licenses and contracts held, of American Illuminating Company, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company
( AIC ), a company owned by WWCD. AIC is a FERC-licensed supplier of deregulated energy. Consummation of the acquisition
of AIC is subject to FERC approval, which has not yet been granted. After final notifications and filings with regulatory agencies
are complete, AIC is expected to begin supplying power immediately to our customers, will recruit additional resellers of deregulated
power and provide them with our sales tools to streamline sales efforts, enforce compliance, and increase productivity. The Company
has reflected the $125,000 payment towards the acquisition as a deposit on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company has two subsidiaries - E3 that
is wholly-owned and TPC that is 80% owned (the  Subsidiaries ). In addition, we will add AIC as a wholly owned subsidiary
when, and if, our acquisition is approved by FERC. 

As used in this quarterly report and unless
otherwise indicated, the term  Company  refers to Premier Holding Corporation and the Company s Subsidiaries.
Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars. 

Basis of Presentation  

The condensed consolidated financial statements
included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which
include only normal recurring adjustments, unless otherwise indicated) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results
of operations for the periods presented have been made. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of trends
or of results to be expected for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 (including the notes thereto) set forth on Form 10-K. The Company uses as guidance
Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). 

Significant Accounting Policies  

For reference to a complete list of significant
accounting policies, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for
the year ended December 31, 2015 (including the notes thereto) set forth on Form 10-K. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Each of these pronouncements,
as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting
pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT S
LIQUIDITY PLANS  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
an accumulated deficit of $28,711,656. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred operating losses
of $3,887,113 and $1,935,159, respectively, and used cash in operating activities of $2,976,879 and $2,270,305, respectively. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company recognizes it
will need to raise additional capital in order to fund operations, meet its payment obligations and execute its business plan.
There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain financing
on terms acceptable to the Company and whether the Company will generate revenues, become profitable and generate positive operating
cash flow. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds on favorable terms, it will have to develop and implement
a plan to further extend payables and to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity on less favorable terms until sufficient
additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful. If the
Company is unable to obtain financing on a timely basis, the Company could be forced to sell its assets, discontinue its operations
and/or pursue other strategic avenues to commercialize its technology. 

Accordingly, the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP for interim financial statements, which contemplates
continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not necessarily
represent realizable or settlement values. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

NOTE 3   ACQUISITIONS   GOODWILL  

The following table presents details of the Company s
goodwill and intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The Power Company USA, LLC Share Exchange  

On February 28, 2013, the Company acquired
80% of the outstanding membership units of TPC, a deregulated power broker in Illinois for thirty million 30,000,000 shares of
Premier s common stock valued at $4,500,000. The total purchase price for TPC was allocated as follows: 

The total amount of goodwill that is expected
to be deductible for tax purposes is $4,500,000 and is amortized over 15 years. The total amortization expense for tax purposes
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is $225,000. 

NOTE 4   CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  

Between July 15, 2014 and December 21,
2015, the Company entered into convertible notes with third parties for use as operating capital for a total of $1,358,500. The
convertible notes payable agreements require the Company to repay the principal, together with 10 - 18% annual interest by the
agreements  expiration dates ranging between July 15, 2019 and August 6, 2020. The notes are secured by assets of the Company
and mature five years from the issuance date and automatically convert into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 80%
of the closing market price on the last day of the month upon which the maturity dates fall, unless an election is made for repayment
in cash. One year from the contract date, the holders may elect to convert the note in whole or in part into shares of common
stock at a conversion price of 80% of the average closing market price over the prior 30 days of trading. During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, a total of $612,000 of these notes were converted into shares of common stock, with a total of $746,500
of these notes remaining as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company analyzed the conversion option
of the notes for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815-15,  Derivatives and Hedging,  and determined that the
instrument should be classified as a liability once the conversion option becomes effective after one year since there is no explicit
limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion options for the notes issued (see Note 6). 

Between March 9, 2015 and May 11, 2016,
the Company entered into convertible notes with third parties for use as operating capital for a total of $2,074,800. The convertible
notes payable agreements require the Company to repay the principal, together with 12% annual interest by the agreements 
expiration dates ranging between March 9, 2017 and May 11, 2019. The notes are secured by assets of the Company and mature three
years from the issuance date. Six months from the contract date, the holders may elect to convert the note in whole or in part
into shares of common stock at $0.15. Two warrants were issued with each note including (1) a warrant to purchase an amount of
equal to 50% of face value of the note at an exercise price $0.15 for a period of three years following the note issuance date
and (2) a warrant to purchase an amount of equal to 83.33% of face value of the note at an exercise price $0.25 for a period of
three years following the note issuance date. The Company recorded an aggregate debt discount of $686,536 for the fair value of
these warrants through September 30, 2016, which is being amortized over the term of the notes, and is included in convertible
notes on the Company s balance sheet at an unamortized remaining balance of $276,502. The total debt discount recorded during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $70,398 and $565,519, respectively. Interest expense related to the amortization
of this debt discount for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $156,426 and $56,859, respectively. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, a total of $690,500 of these notes were converted into shares of common stock, with a total
of $1,384,300 of these notes remaining as of September 30, 2016. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, the total of all notes converted was $1,302,500, with the holders receiving an aggregate of 32,562,500 shares of common
stock. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded interest expense of $1,769,083 and $256,819, respectively. 

NOTE 5   DERIVATIVE LIABILITY  

The embedded conversion feature in the
convertible debt instruments (the  Notes ) that the Company issued beginning in July 2014 (See Note 4), and became
convertible beginning in July 2015, qualified it as a derivative instrument since the number of shares issuable under the note
is indeterminate based on guidance under ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging . The conversion feature of these convertible promissory
notes has been characterized as a derivative liability beginning in July 2015 to be re-measured at the end of every reporting period
with the change in value reported in the statement of operations. 

The valuation of the derivative liability
attached to the convertible debt was determined by management using a binomial pricing model that values the derivative liability
within the notes. Using the results from the model, the Company recorded a derivative liability of $1,086,000 for the fair value
of the convertible feature included in the Company s convertible debt instruments as of September 30, 2016. The derivative
liability recorded for the convertible feature created a debt discount of $1,437,000, which is being amortized over the remaining
term of the notes using the effective interest rate method and is included in convertible notes on the balance sheet. Interest
expense related to the amortization of this debt discount for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $186,081. Additionally,
$444,000 of debt discount was charged to interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing the amount
of debt discount in excess of the convertible debt. A total of $514,067 of the debt discount was charged to interest expense during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to convertible debt converted during the period. 

Key inputs and assumptions used to value
the embedded conversion feature in the month the Notes became convertible were as follows: 

The average value of a share of Company stock in the month the Notes became convertible, the measurement
date - ranging from $0.0756 - $0.1172 (per the over-the-counter market quotes);   

The average conversion price of all Notes issued in their month of issuance, with such conversion
price determined based on 80% of the average over-the-counter market price for the 30 days preceding the one-year anniversary of
all Notes in that month s pool;   

The number of shares into which Notes in pool would convert - face amount of the Notes in that
month s pool divided by the average conversion price for Notes included in that month s pool;   

Assumed annual volatility of Company stock   128.6%; and   

The Company would be unable to repay the notes within their term.   

Additional key inputs and assumptions used
to value the embedded conversion feature as of September 30, 2016: 

Number of shares into which Notes would convert - face value of Notes divided by $0.0554.   

The following table summarizes the derivative
liability included in the consolidated balance sheet: 

NOTE 6   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY

Common Stock  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company entered into a series of stock purchase agreements with accredited investors for the sale of 76,587,106 shares

valued at $0.052 to $0.077 per share, based upon the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date totaling $992,800,
which was recognized immediately as general and administrative expense. The Company issued 32,562,500 shares of common stock for
the conversion of convertible notes totaling $1,302,500. Additionally, approximately 1,000,000 shares of common stock were cancelled
and returned to the treasury. 

Unless otherwise set forth above, the securities
described above were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), or the securities
laws of any state, and were offered and sold in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) under the
Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder and corresponding provisions of state securities laws, which exempt transactions
by an issuer not involving any public offering.

NOTE 7   DISCONTINUED OPERATION  

The Company acquired assets from LP L
on October 22, 2014. Due to the default of the purchase agreement between the Company and LP L on April 7, 2015, the Company
lost control over LP L. Based on the requirements of ASC 810 , Consolidation , the Company will no longer present assets
and liabilities retained as of the date of deconsolidation. To accomplish this, the results of LP L s operations are
reported in discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205 , Presentation of Financial Statements . 

Summarized operating results for the discontinuation
of operations is as follows: 

As of the date of deconsolidation, in accordance
with ASC 810 , Consolidation , we recognized a gain of $1,852,884 related to this event during the second quarter of 2015.
We have no carried value of assets related to our retained investment in LP L, but retain a non-controlling equity interest,
which is 1.56% of LP L interest with fair value amount of $0. The Company analyzed the carrying value of LP L s net
assets on the deconsolidation date and determined the amount to be $1,439,077 including the following, 

The Company had no involvement with the
management of LP L after the date of deconsolidation and confirms that this transaction was not with a related party and that

Legal Proceedings  

Whitaker Energy, LLC  

In 2013, Whitaker Energy, LLC ( Whitaker )
filed a civil action the Superior Court of Dekalb County, State of Georgia, Case No. 13-CV8610-6, against TPC and the Company alleging
that TPC is in default under its obligations to Whitaker under a promissory note pursuant to which Whitaker loaned TPC $150,000
in 2012 concurrent with Whitaker s purchase of a membership interest in TPC. Under the terms of the loan between TPC and
Whitaker, TPC owed a monthly payment to Whitaker, the amount of which varies each month and is based on the number of contracts
TPC enters into from door-to-door sales and call centers. TPC and Whitaker dispute the number of contracts entered into by TPC
after certain adjustments and charge-backs from cancellation of contracts by consumers. Under the complaint, Whitaker seeks to
recover $93,080 of principal under the loan, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $9,184 and reasonable attorneys 
fees and expenses of the litigation. In addition, Whitaker seeks an order from the court for access to TPC s books and records.
TPC and the Company dispute the claim by Whitaker that TPC is in default under the loan between TPE and Whitaker. As of April 23,
2014, the parties to the litigation have negotiated a settlement of the litigation which would include a monthly payment by TPC
to Whitaker of $4,000 in payment of the principal and accrued interest. Under the terms of the settlement, Whitaker will recover
a total of $110,000 plus interest on unpaid amounts. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has made payments totaling $110,000,
with no remaining balance due at September 30, 2016. 

Hi-Tech Specialists, Inc.  

Prior to its acquisition by TPC, Hi-Tech
Specialists, Inc. ( Hi-Tech ) filed suit against U.S.E.C. LLC d/b/a/ US Energy Consultants and Michail Skachko concerning
the parties  agreement seeking damages in an amount in excess of $789,077. The nature of the litigation relates to a contract
between the parties wherein Hi-Tech was to solicit service agreements on behalf of U.S.E.C. LLC. The suit is ongoing and TPC is
aggressively pursuing its claim against the parties named. 

Lexington Power   Light, LLC  

LP L rents office space under several
non-cancelable operating lease agreements in the same commercial building that commenced beginning in March 2014, all of which
expired on February 28, 2016. The annual rental payments required under these operating lease agreements for 2015 and 2016 were
$46,867 and $7,849, respectively. Due to the default of the acquisition note payable, the acquisition of LP L was terminated
on April 7, 2015, thus the Company is no longer obligated to this operating lease effective April 7, 2015. 

As of December 31, 2013, LP L had a
contingent liability related to a complaint filed by a single commercial customer with the New York Public Service Commission seeking
a reimbursement of $40,000. The Company had determined it appropriate under the circumstances to recognize and accrue this loss
contingency. Due to the default of the acquisition note payable, the acquisition of LP L was terminated on April 7, 2015, thus
the Company is no longer obligated to this loss contingency effective April 7, 2015.

all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars. 

Corporate Overview  

We are an energy services holding company.
We provide an array of energy services through our subsidiary companies, E3 and TPC. In addition, we have entered into agreements
to acquire AIC, and can consummate that acquisition upon receipt of FERC approval. We provide solutions that enable customers to
reduce their electricity rates and energy consumption, lower their operating and maintenance costs, and realize environmental benefits.
Our comprehensive set of services includes competitive electricity plans and upgrades to a facility s energy infrastructure.
Our stock is quoted on the OTC Markets under the symbol  PRHL . 

We were incorporated in Nevada on October
18, 1971 under the name of Mr. Nevada, Inc., and following the completion of a limited public offering in April 1972, we commenced
limited operations which were discontinued in 1990. Thereafter, we engaged in reorganization and, on several occasions, sought
to merge with or acquire certain active private companies or operations, all of which were terminated or resulted in discontinued
negotiations. On November 13, 2008, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the State
of Nevada Secretary to change its name from OVM International Holding Corporation to Premier Holding Corporation. In 2012, we discontinued
our former lines of business and began offering clean energy products and services. In December 2011, we acquired assets from WePower,
LLC and Green Central Holdings, Inc. in order to start a second line of business unrelated to our historical businesses. We also
formed WePower Ecolutions Inc. ( Ecolutions ) as a wholly-owned subsidiary and began to offer clean energy products
and services to commercial markets and developers and management companies of large-scale residential developments. 

In October 2012, we divested our business
of certain underperforming product lines and prospects which were acquired by a newly formed entity known as WePowerEco Corp. and
negotiated the sale of the product line and prospects with WePowerEco Corp. in exchange for an unsecured promissory note in the
face amount of $5,000,000. Subsequently the note had been conservatively valued at approximately $869,000. In connection with the
sale of the product line and prospects, we agreed not to compete with WePower Eco Corp s solar and wind products for a period
of two years following the sale. In addition, we agreed to the let the prior management team use the WePower name in a newly formed
company separate from the Company. 

In 2012, we acquired a technology for energy
efficient lighting, the E-Series controller developed by Active ES. This patented technology provides an upgrade for existing HID
lamps for high-bay indoor and outdoor applications where the other current options for efficiency are new and untested, and expensive.
This technology is being marketed by E3. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we performed additional research and development to the
products from Active ES adding two new products for mass production, the 480-volt version of the controller, suitable for ports
and other large facilities, and a 240-volt version of the LiteOwl for Streetlights, vastly increasing the applicable market. 

In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired
an 80% stake in TPC, a deregulated power broker in Illinois. By the end of that quarter, TPC had over 11,000 clients and has been
adding between 1,000 and 3,000 clients per month. Over 1,000 of these clients have commercial/industrial facilities such as small
businesses, warehouses and distribution centers, which we believe are candidates for E3. While a part of our company, this has
grown to over 200,000 contracts sold, and selling over 5,000 per month. 

On May 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive
agreement with WWCD to acquire for $125,000 all membership units, including all licenses and contracts held, of AIC, a FERC-licensed
supplier of deregulated energy. Consummation of the acquisition of AIC is subject to FERC approval, which has not yet been granted.
After final notifications and filings with regulatory agencies are complete, AIC is expected to begin supplying power immediately
to our customers, will recruit additional resellers of deregulated power and provide them with our sales tools to streamline sales
efforts, enforce compliance, and increase productivity. 

In addition to organic growth, strategic
acquisitions of complementary businesses and assets have been an important part of our historical development. Since inception,
the Company has completed numerous acquisitions, most recently two of which have enabled us to broaden our service offerings and
expand our geographical reach. 

We bridge two industries in the Energy
field: Deregulation (reselling power from suppliers) and energy efficiency technologies. Deregulated power is expected to be one
of the largest markets since the deregulation of telecom, only much larger. Energy efficiency companies, sometimes referred to
as energy services companies, or ESCOs, develop, install and arrange financing for projects designed to improve the energy efficiency
of client facilities. Typical products and services offered by energy efficiency companies include lighting and lighting retrofits,
HVAC upgrades, motor controls, equipment installations, load management, and can include power generation including on-site cogeneration,
renewable energy plants, etc. As we grow, we expect to be involved in all these opportunities. Energy efficiency companies often
offer their products and services through energy savings performance contracts, or ESPCs. Under these contracts, energy efficiency
companies assume certain responsibilities for the performance of the installed measures, under assumed conditions, for a portion
of the project s economic lifetime. We operate as a deregulated power reseller and as an ESCO. 

E3 s Business  

E3 is an Energy Services Company (ESCO)
formed by the Company to provide energy reduction solutions for its clients. Through surveys and various analysis, E3 prescribes
the best solution for the unique circumstance of each client by providing the most current, vetted solutions in energy reduction
technologies, as well as management tools which capture the client for future opportunities. 

Many companies only provide stand-alone
solutions and only address one area of energy efficiency. E3 looks at its clients  entire energy footprint and develops custom
solutions that fit their distinct requirements. E3 prescribes the most appropriate solutions for its clients  facilities
and operations based on their budget. In addition, E3 facilitates the entire process from assessment of needs to planning and implementation
to ensure that all expectations for energy reduction and technology performance are met. E3 also provides financing through third-party
partners for its customers. 

E3 lowers the cost of energy through competitive
supplier bidding and creates comprehensive energy savings solutions through the implementation of energy reduction projects. The
mission of E3 is to help a customer select and implement the most cost effective energy conservation measures for its facilities.
E3 s energy services division is focused on providing business customers with demand management solutions such as lighting
(LED etc.), HVAC, Commercial Refrigeration and Water Sub-Metering and Smart Building technology. 

The Company believes that E3 is finding
success in the sale and installation of LED lighting both as direct sales to mid- and large-sized customers and in utilizing rebate
programs from power providers (SCE, etc.). E3 continues to recruit LED resellers whose clients have declined an LED sale and is
going back to those clients and offering the E-Series technology as a solution for their existing HID lighting. This includes,
but is not limited to, end users such as auto dealerships, warehouses, and parking structures. 

TPC s Business  

TPC provides competitive energy pricing
delivered with no change in service. There are currently 14 states that have deregulated their energy markets in a manner attractive
to business. While many consumers have already benefitted from deregulated energy, there are millions more that have not taken
advantage of this opportunity. It is estimated that federally requested energy deregulation will be enacted in some form in more
of the 50 states by 2020. The deregulation industry is estimated at 7 to 11 times larger than when the telecom industry deregulated.
Today and as this market broadens, the Company expects TPC to continue to leverage its strength in these emerging markets. 

Prior to deregulation, the utility market
in each state was monopolized. At that time, a few, sometimes only one, utility in each state provided all components of energy
services: supply and distribution. In 1992, Congress passed the National Energy Policy Act, allowing consumers in deregulated states
the power to choose their energy supplier. TPC is an experienced energy consulting firm in the deregulation space that utilizes
its market standing and its large, well-established network of energy suppliers to compete for its clients  business. With
no cost or obligation for its clients, TPC serves as its clients  energy advocates and negotiates the most competitive pricing
and options for its clientele. Because of TPC s buying power, market expertise, and strong and diverse supplier relationships,
TPC can achieve results and cost savings that are greater than most individuals and/or organizations can obtain on their own. 

TPC s business model is to enlist
commercial and residential clients who benefit from the law passed allowing for competition in the energy markets as a result of
deregulation of energy. In many cases TPC saves its clients 10% to 30% on their energy bills by simply switching suppliers, all
while the enrollee still receives services from their local utility (the local utility continues to distribute the power, read
the meter, bill, and service any interruptions). TPC is different than several of its competitors in that is has agreements with
multiple energy suppliers allowing TPC to leverage its standing in the marketplace to garner competitive pricing for its clients
by having its suppliers compete for their clients  business. Currently, TPC has access to over 30 different suppliers and
has most of the agreements in place that allow for TPC to be paid for the life of the client s tenure with the supplier.
TPC acquires its clients through strategic partnerships, trained in-house commercial and door-to-door residential agents and call
centers. 

TPC utilizes its online client energy portal.
This energy portal enables rapid, efficient and secure sales transactions of deregulated power. The energy portal is designed to
enable sales agents, whether from a computer terminal, a smart phone, or any web browser to access the pertinent information on
a particular prospect. Agents can view their clients  energy profiles and quickly access the energy options available to
them. The transparency and ease of the energy portal allows TPC s agents to select the best power provider for their customers
and process the paperwork online in real-time, which enables client acquisition in minutes. This sales portal enables large-scale,
rapid sales of deregulated power. The energy portal is built for scalability so that it can be monetized on its own, meaning it
can be offered to any deregulated power company as its sales tool. The technology also provides sales management, reporting, verification,
and compliance tracking which may be among the best in the industry. 

AIC s Business  

The primary value that AIC will add to
the Company (assuming we obtain FERC approval for the acquisition) is that it enables customers to recognize immediate savings
via lowering their electricity bills by supplying energy marketing firms with a more competitive platform to access electricity
contracts and support. Through the Company s ownership of TPC, this creates a built-in strategic partnership for the states
that TPC is already licensed in to broker power, including Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts,
Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas. AIC will have to obtain state, local,
utility and other approvals in order to supply power in these several states, but pending such approvals, AIC may benefit from
TPCs existing database of over 200,000 current and past clients to  jumpstart  its progress. We anticipate that half
of all contracts written by TPC could be supplied by AIC. 

Through this relationship to establish
a large wholesale broker sales network, AIC plans to achieve operating and sales velocity more quickly in order to form a strong
foundation to establish positive cash flows. We believe that TPC can direct a material portion of its customers to AIC. We believe
this presents a major opportunity for AIC to scale quickly through its strong relationship with TPC. In addition to contract sales
generated by TPC, we expect that AIC will expand its offerings to consumers through other energy brokers in order to expand revenue. 

Corporate Developments During 2016  

Since
the commencement of the year through September 30, 2016, we experienced the following corporate developments:  

Development of ESP  

During the first quarter ended March 31,
2016, we began development of the next generation of the Energy Services Portal ( ESP ) V3.0. Formerly the National
Energy Services Transactor, or NEST, the name was changed to avoid confusion in the market with another product. This new version
is being developed to further expand its features and capabilities and to accommodate the needs of multiple resellers of deregulated
power on behalf of the newly acquired supplier. 

Results of Operations  

Comparison of the Three Months Ended
September 30, 2016 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue and Operating Expenses  

The Company s revenue and operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows: 

The decrease in revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is due primarily to a reduction in residential
revenue from our TPC subsidiary. 

The increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is due primarily
to the increased use of consultants. 

Other Income (Expense)  

The increase in other expense for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior period is mainly attributable to the increase in convertible notes and derivative
liability, as well as the write-off of unamortized derivative debt discounts on converted notes, resulting in increased interest
expense and increase in consulting fees. This increase is partially offset by the gain from the decrease in the fair value of the
derivative liability during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue and Operating Expenses  

The Company s revenue and operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows: 

The decrease in revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is due primarily to a decrease in residential revenue
from our TPC subsidiary, partially offset by increase in its commercial and call center revenues. 

The increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is due primarily to
the increased use of consultants. 

Other Income (Expense)  

The increase in other expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior period is mainly attributable to the increase in convertible notes and derivative
liability, as well as the write-off of unamortized derivative debt discounts on converted notes, resulting in increased interest
expense. This increase is partially offset by the gain from the decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Working Capital  

The following table sets forth a summary of working capital
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The increase in working capital is due
primarily from an increase in cash from the sale of the Company s common stock, as well as a reduction in convertible notes
due to notes converted to common stock. 

Cash Flows  

The following table sets forth a summary of changes in cash
flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The increase in cash used in operating
activities was due primarily to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. 

The increase in cash used in investing
activities was due primarily the acquisition of AIC for cash of $125,000 in May of 2016. 

The increase in cash from financing activities
was due primarily to increased proceeds from the sale of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the same period in 2015. 

Private Placement Offering  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company entered into a series of stock purchase agreements with accredited investors for the sale of 76,587,106 shares
of its common stock in amount of $4,014,822. 

Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit  

The Company did not enter into any new
short-term debt or lines of credit with third parties during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Convertible Notes Payable  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company entered into convertible notes with third parties for use as operating capital for total proceeds of $295,000. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company issued 32,562,500 shares of its common stock for the conversion of convertible notes totaling $1,302,500. 

Going Concern  

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-Q have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
Since inception, the Company has financed its operations primarily through proceeds from the issuance of common stock and convertible
notes payable. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $28,711,656. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company incurred operating losses of $3,887,113 and used cash in operating activities of $2,976,879. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management is in the process of evaluating
various financing alternatives in order to finance our research and development activities and general and administrative expenses.
These alternatives include raising funds through public or private equity markets and either through institutional or retail investors.
Although there is no assurance that the Company will be successful with our fund raising initiatives, management believes that
the Company will be able to secure the necessary financing as a result of ongoing financing discussions with third party investors
and existing shareholders. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s
continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to
attain profitability. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of current
shareholders could be reduced, and such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to its common stock. Additional
financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable
terms, the Company may not be able to take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly
and materially restrict its future plans for developing its business and achieving commercial revenues. If the Company is unable
to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may have to cease operations. 

Future Financing  

We will require additional funds to implement
our growth strategy for our business. In addition, while we have received capital from various private placements and convertible
loans that have enabled us to fund our operations, these funds have been largely used to supplement our working capital, although
additional funds are needed for other corporate operational and working capital purposes. At this time, we have sufficient capital
to fund our operations for the next 12 months. However, once we consummate the acquisition of AIC that is subject to FERC approval,
which has not yet been granted, we expect to need additional capital to be able to purchase power and pay commissions. At this
time, we have not determined the amount that may be needed. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing,
or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There can be no assurance that additional
financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we
are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis should it be required, or generate significant material revenues
from operations, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps
even cease our operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our significant accounting policies are
more fully described in the notes to our financial statements included herein for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and in the
notes to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

Any recently issued accounting pronouncements
are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included herein for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company as defined
by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The Company maintains disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including the Company s interim president and chief executive officer (who is the Company s principal executive officer)
and the Company s chief financial officer, treasurer, and secretary (who is the Company s principal financial officer
and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and
the Company s management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. 

Management s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting  

Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management, with
the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer has conducted an assessment,
including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) (2013). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. This assessment included review of the documentation of controls,
evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this
evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the Company s management concluded its internal control over financial reporting was
not effective as of September 30, 2016. The ineffectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting was
due to the following material weaknesses which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: 

(i) 
     inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and  
 
     (ii) 
     ineffective controls over period-end financial disclosure and reporting processes.  

Our management feels the weaknesses identified
above have not had any material effect on our financial results. However, we are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and
procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes in the next calendar year, including identifying
specific areas within our governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to potentially mitigate
these material weaknesses. Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and
procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and
implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within any company have been detected. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.
Legal Proceedings 

The Company is not a party to any material
pending legal proceedings and, to the best of its knowledge, no such action by or against the Company has been threatened, except
as noted below: 

Hi-Tech Specialists, Inc.  

Prior to its acquisition by TPC, Hi-Tech
Specialists, Inc. ( Hi-Tech ) filed suit against U.S.E.C. LLC d/b/a/ US Energy Consultants and Michail Skachko concerning
the parties  agreement seeking damages in an amount in excess of $789,077. The nature of the litigation relates to a contract
between the parties wherein Hi-Tech was to solicit service agreements on behalf of U.S.E.C. LLC. The suit is ongoing and TPC is
aggressively pursuing its claim against the parties named. 

Lexington Power   Light, LLC  

As of December 31, 2013, LP L had a
contingent liability related to a complaint filed by a single commercial customer with the New York Public Service Commission seeking
a reimbursement of $40,000. The Company had determined it appropriate under the circumstances to recognize and accrue this loss
contingency. Due to the default of the acquisition note payable, the acquisition of LP L was terminated on April 7, 2015, thus
the Company is no longer obligated to this loss contingency effective April 7, 2015. 

Item 1A.
Risk Factors

which was recognized immediately as general and administrative expense. The Company issued 32,562,500 shares of common stock for
the conversion of convertible notes totaling $1,302,500.
