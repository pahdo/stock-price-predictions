 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2016 
 (Stated in US Dollars) 
  (Unaudited ) 

Note 1 
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of International Barrier Technology Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2016.  The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company at September 30, 2016, and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  It should be understood that accounting measures at interim dates inherently involve greater reliance on estimates than at year end.  The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods. 
   
 Note 2 
  Significant Accounting Policies  
   
  a)  
  Earnings per Share  
   
 Basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the net income or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents.  Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net income or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares, plus the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. 
   
 The treasury stock method is used in calculating diluted EPS for potentially dilutive stock options and share purchase warrants, which assumes that any proceeds received from the exercise of in-the-money stock options and share purchase warrants, would be used to purchase common shares at the average market price for the period. 
   
 EPS for convertible debt is calculated under the  if-converted  method.  Under the  if converted  method, EPS is calculated as the more dilutive of EPS (i) including all interest (both cash interest and non-cash discount amortization) and excluding all shares underlying the convertible debt or; (ii) excluding all interest (both cash interest and non-cash discount amortization) and including all shares underlying the convertible debt.  As at September 30, 2016 and 2015, common share equivalents, consisting of common shares issuable, on exercise of options, conversion of convertible debentures and conversion of share purchase warrants of 4,862,238 and 4,555,610, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect was anti-dilutive.   
   
  b)  
  Revenue Recognition   
   
 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605,  Revenue Recognition , which requires that: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii) the sales price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue when the building supplies have been shipped. 
   
 Revenue for LP  FlameBlock Fire-Rated OSB Sheathing includes only the charges for treatment services, not the underlying OSB substrate or outbound freight as the customer supplies its own OSB Substrate and contracts for its own outgoing freight.

Note 2 
  Significant Accounting Policies    (cont.) 
   
  b)  
  Revenue Recognition    (cont.) 
 The Company periodically enters into arrangements that contain multiple deliverable elements requiring an evaluation of each deliverable to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. Each delivered item constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customer obligating the Company to determine a selling price for each deliverable.  
   
  License Fees  
 Revenue from up-front license fees and milestone payments is recognized as performance occurs and the respective obligations are completed. Prior to the completion of performance obligations, up-front payments are recorded as deferred revenue.   
   
  Royalty Revenue  
 Royalty revenue from sales of our products is generally recognized when received or earned in accordance with the terms of the license fees agreements.  
   
  c)  
  Plant and Equipment, Trademark and Technology Rights and Depreciation  
   
 Plant and equipment and trademark and technology rights are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is provided as follows: 
   
 Manufacturing equipment  
 straight line over estimated useful 
 lives ranging from 5 years to 30 
 years. 
 Equipment and furniture  
 20%- declining balance 
 Computer equipment  
 30% - declining balance 
 Railway spur  
 4% - declining balance 
 Equipment under capital lease  
 20% - declining balance 
 Building  
 straight line over 20 years 

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over their estimated useful economic life. 
   
 Note 3 
  Fair Value Measurements  
   
 The book value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short term maturity of those instruments.  The fair value hierarchy under GAAP is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following: 
   
 Level 1-   quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
   
 Level 2 -   
 observable inputs other than Level I, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and  
   
 Level 3 -  
 assets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Note 3 
  Fair Value Measurements    (cont.) 
   
 Certain of the Company s cash equivalents, consisting of short-term term deposits, are based on Level 2 inputs in the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy. 
   
 The Company s convertible debentures are based on Level 2 inputs in the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy.  The Company calculated the fair value of these instruments by discounting future cash flows using rates representative of current borrowing rates.  At September 30, 2016, the convertible debentures had a fair value of $937,808 (June 30, 2016:  $729,323). 
   
 As at September 30, 2016, the Company has no assets or liabilities that have fair values measured using Level 3 inputs.

  Convertible Debt  
   
 During the year ended June 30, 2012, the Company approved the issuance of two convertible debentures to a director and a company controlled by a director in the amount of $300,000.  The debentures are being issued in tranches from $10,000-$50,000 and as at September 30, 2016 the Company had received $240,000 (June 30, 2016:  $240,000) in respect of these debentures.  The debentures bear interest at 12% per annum, payable quarterly, and are collateralized by a third charge over the Company s plant and equipment as well as a charge against the Company s patents.  At any time, the notes are convertible into units of the Company at a price of $0.10 per unit.  Each unit will consist of one common share and one common share purchase warrant entitling the holder the right to purchase one additional share for $0.10 for a period of two years from the conversion date. During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred interest charges of $7,200 (2015:  $7,200) on these convertible debentures.

   Description of Business   
 International Barrier Technology Inc. (Barrier) manufactures and sells fire-rated building materials. Barrier s primary business is in the United States, but also has a license agreement with a major OSB producer in the European Union.  In addition, Barrier is working to develop distribution partnerships and manufacturing technology license agreements and is successfully endeavoring to enter building products markets in Australia, Europe, and South America. Barrier possesses a proprietary fire resistive material technology (Pyrotite ) and a patented manufacturing process that when applied to building materials their respective fire resistant properties are significantly enhanced.  Many of the top multifamily and wood frame commercial builders in the United States utilize Barrier s fire-rated structural panels in areas where the building code requires the use of a fire-rated building panel. 
   
 Barrier s financial statements are filed with both the SEC (USA) and SEDAR (Canada) and are disclosed in US dollars utilizing US generally accepted accounting principles.  Barrier s filings with the SEC consist of quarterly reviewed financial statements on Form 10-Q and annual audited financial statements on Form 10-K.  Barrier continues to file the above financial statements with SEDAR in Canada. 
   
   Sales   revenue reported for the quarterly period ending September 30, 2016 was $2,475,587 in comparison to $2,133,813 generated in the same comparable period in 2015. Total sales volume, as measured by surface volume of product shipped increased 26% to 6,507,232 sq. ft., from the 5,162,100 sq. ft. shipped in the previous year.  The following   is a summary of changes in sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016: 

Shipments into the Residential Roof Deck, Wall Assembly, and Structural Insulated Panel Market Sectors (LP FlameBlock)   during the quarter increased 49% over shipments in the comparable quarter last year, while sales into the Commercial Modular Market (FR Deck Panel) declined 28%.  The increase in the Residential Roof Deck/Wall Assembly Market is a direct result of sales and marketing efforts nationwide to build demand for the new capacity coming online in Clarke County Alabama.  The decrease in Commercial Modular sales is likely contributed to the increase in commodity OSB pricing and lower demand in that market currently. 

11 

Barrier also continues to manufacture fire resistant I-Joist as this remains a timely and important topic in North America s building environment at this time.  Web stock material treated at Watkins is being used to assist in the development of a committed market demand for Pyrotite  technology.  Concurrently, plans and decisions for manufacturing or licensing the production of treated I-Joist in the long-term are being developed and made.  Barrier anticipates the negative impact I-Joist R D has on shipments will diminish as efficiencies in production at Watkins improve with experience. 
   
 Barrier and LP    Building Products (LP) conduct business guided by a Supply Agreement.  In August 2015, LP and Barrier negotiated some refinements to the agreement and extended it through December 31, 2019.  In addition, Barrier granted a license to LP for the manufacture and distribution of Pyrotite  products in a plant in Clarke County Alabama.  This license agreement will provide an additional revenue stream for Barrier.  LP held a ground breaking ceremony in early January 2016 for the new FlameBlock OSB Sheathing line at their Clarke County Alabama location which is anticipated to start production during the current quarter. 
   
 Barrier s relationship with LP has contributed to an increase in sales volume to record levels and Barrier anticipates that sales will continue to grow substantially through the sustained efforts of LP s sales and marketing team.  Reported sales revenue for LP products, include only the charges for treatment services, not the underlying OSB substrate or outbound freight as LP supplies its own OSB substrate and contracts for its own outgoing freight.  The  pass through  of the OSB substrate and freight serves to lower reported  top line  sales revenue, but not gross profits since margins on substrate and freight have historically been restricted to handling costs only to help keep prices competitive.  For the Commercial Modular market, Barrier purchases OSB from local distributors and invoices the cost of the substrate and outgoing freight to the customer, therefore the cost of the substrate and freight is included in revenue for Commercial Modular shipments. 
   
   Gross profit   for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 was $274,835 vs. $291,859 in the previous year quarter. The gross margin, as a percentage of sales revenue, decreased to 11% in the current quarter from 14% in the prior comparable period.  During the reporting period, a tornado and excessive heat temporarily affected production. 
 In the near term, gross margins are anticipated to improve slightly based on increased production, focus on labor and materials efficiency and continued gains in fire-rated I-joist production efficiency.  
   
   Cost of sales   increased to $2,200,752 from $1,841,954 in the prior year quarterly period.  The increase is attributable to the increase in volume produced.  Manufacturing efficiency as measured by the average cost per square foot of production improved to $0.34 vs. $0.36 during the comparable reporting period last year.   
   
 Substrate cost and materials/labor were the major expenses in this category.  Substrate accounted for $346,430 for the period versus $418,546 in the same period last year. Materials and labor accounted for an additional $1,463,866 in the three month period in 2016 versus $1,054,283 in 2015.   
   
 Depreciation on plant and equipment is included in cost of sales category. Depreciation, which has non-cash impact on Barrier s actual cash flow, decreased from $88,402 in Q1 Fiscal 2016 to $69,490 in Q1 Fiscal 2017.  The expense reflects scheduled depreciation of the newer manufacturing line equipment and building improvements.   
   
   Administrative expenses   for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $274,361 from $310,639 in the prior year quarterly period.  The administrative costs per sq. ft. were $0.04 for the quarter in comparison to $0.06 reported through September 30, 2015. 
   
   Accounting and Audit Fees   increased from $27,766 to $56,505.  A significant portion of the cost for accounting services is related to the year-end audit of Barrier s annual financial statements.  The year-to-year cost differential reported here is related to the timing of invoices from the year-end audit and is expected to be more even year to year, once the next quarterly financial statements are published.    
   
   Insurance costs   have increased slightly from $18,848 to $23,767 as a result of increased volume and annual premiums. 
   
   Legal fees   decreased significantly from $18,653 in Q1 2016 to $7,098 in Q1 2017.  Legal fees the prior year was expended on activities in support of developing strategic partners and technology licensees.  In addition each year for beginning preparations for the year-end Annual General Meeting, as well as in monitoring and protecting Pyrotite  patents and trademarks. 

12 

Barrier has four issued patents, two in the US, a patent in Australia, and a patent in Canada. These patents protect the manufacturing and process technology utilized in the production of fire-rated sheathing products utilizing Pyrotite .  In addition, Barrier has a provisional patent from the US Patent Office for the process of treating I-Joists with Pyrotite   . 
   
   Sales, marketing, and investor relations   expenses decreased from $7,057 to $5,560 for the current quarter reported, year to year. During the reporting period, there were sales trips directly related to the expansion of product markets and potential manufacturing expansion sites. 
   
 The majority of sales and marketing activities for traditional uses of Barrier s Pyrotite  treated structural wood panels continue to be performed by Louisiana Pacific, Inc.  This helps Barrier keep the cost of sales and marketing as low as reasonably possible. 
   
   Wages and management fees   decreased to $151,437 from $211,947.  The major decrease in the fee is attributed to Board of Director remuneration for the execution of the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation Technology License Agreement in the prior year.   
   
   Operating Income   of $474 is being reported for the quarterly period ending September 30, 2016, whereas in the same period in 2015, operating loss of $(18,780) was reported. 
   
 It is Barrier s fundamental belief that increased sales volume coupled with an intense focus on manufacturing efficiency in both labor and materials is the best pathway to long-term profitability.  
   
   Other items   include income and costs not directly related to business operations.  Other income items reported during the quarterly ended September 30, 2016 herein includes interest/other income of $379.  To compare, for the same reporting period last year there was interest/other income of $325.   
   
 Interest on Long Term Debt has decreased from $8,287 to $7,771 for the 3-month reporting period as a result of larger principal payments as long term debt continues to decline.   
   
   Net loss.    Net loss of $(6,918) is being reported for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, whereas in the same period in 2015, net loss of $(26,742) was reported.  
   
 Barrier remains focused on cutting costs and improving efficiencies wherever it can.  This includes operating the manufacturing line with maximum efficiency.  Barrier continues to keep a vigilant handle on costs to help keep operational costs as low as possible and enable financial improvements   to continue. 
   
   Summary of Quarterly Results.    The following is a summary of the Company s financial results for the nine most recently completed quarters: 

13 

Selected Annual Information   
 The following financial data is for the three most recent years ended June 30: 

New product and market development   
 Barrier continues to provide support to LP for a number of new product and market development initiatives including activity directed specifically toward applications in geographic areas where wildfires are prevalent and where building code development is becoming more restrictive with respect to designing for improved fire resistance.  Focus has continued on developing products engineered to meet requirements established for Wildland/Urban Interface (WUI) zones.  WUI zones are primarily located in the western US, and are areas where special building codes have been developed to help save homes if a brush fire should occur. 
   
 Enhanced focus has been made over this past year on developing products used in multifamily residential projects since the multifamily market is strong and is expected to stay vibrant over the next few years.  In particular, Barrier and LP s introduction of a UL certified 2-hr exterior load bearing wall designed for use in wood-frame buildings of Type III construction is being well received by architects, building code professionals and builders alike.  As more architects and specifying engineers become aware of this new design Barrier and LP are confident that considerable sales will result for these projects.   
   
 Barrier and LP continue exploring opportunities related to emerging code requirements for Engineered Wood Products (EWP) such as I-Joist and Rimboard.  I-Joist and Rimboard produced using oriented strand board (OSB) technology are widely used in the building industry but have only recently been put under intense scrutiny for structural performance in a fire.  Both Barrier and LP believe there is significant opportunity in developing EWP products that are rated for performance in a fire situation. 
   
 After successful preliminary fire testing and initial test marketing, further testing resulted in a UL certified fire-rated I-Joist listing and small scale commercial production has begun.  Barrier and LP s EWP Division will be actively pursuing these exciting opportunities during the next fiscal year.  By working together we will endeavor to develop products that will meet code requirements being developed by the International Code Council (ICC), as well as production technology and capacity.   
   
   Global licensing opportunities   
 Barrier continues to explore manufacturing and distribution opportunities for Pyrotite    technology in geographies outside of the US.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, Barrier announced a licensing agreement for the manufacture and distribution of Pyrotite    products in the European Union and Russia.  Kronospan, a world-wide leader in OSB manufacturing, has officially added  OSB Pyrotite ECO  (a fire-resistant OSB panel) to their family of products.  Barrier provided technical assistance in the design of their first manufacturing line, the transfer of production process technology, and material acquisition criteria.  The manufacturing line is now fully operational.  The license agreement provides for a payment made quarterly to Barrier by the Licensee of a royalty based on the volume of product produced. A minimum annual royalty fee was established along with an  up-front  license fee which was paid pursuant to the execution of the license agreement.  The agreement contemplates the Licensee developing additional production facilities over the term of the license and making additional royalty payments to Barrier based on these plants production.  The license agreement follows standard licensing protocol, which allows for the audit of manufacturing process and financial revenue information.   
   
 The selection of Pyrotite    technology by the licensor after extensive research and testing of several other fire-resistant technologies adds additional credibility to our Pyrotite    technology and could lead to potential interest in other geographies.  Particular interest in Barrier s Pyrotite  technology has been expressed by parties in China, Australia, and South America.

Financial position   financings   
   
 Barrier ended the period with a working capital surplus (current assets less current liabilities) of $1,163,898 vs. $1,190,582 for the period ended September 30, 2015.  Operating cash flow was $75,257 in comparison to $381,198 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 Financing activities resulted in net cash inflow of $101,282 
  in the current quarter compared to a net cash outflow of $19,199 for the comparable period.   
   
 Barrier has a short term revolving line of credit ($500,000) at the local Farmers State Bank of Watkins, in Watkins, Minnesota.  As of September 30, 2016 the balance owing on the revolving line of credit was $0 leaving an additional $500,000 available for use.  In addition, two convertible debentures in the amount of $150,000 each were established in December 2011.  To date, $240,000 has been used on these debentures with an additional $60,000 available for cash flow if needed. 
   
 Investing activities resulted in net cash outflow of $75,053 in the current period in comparison to a net cash outflow of $125,581 in the prior year.  The cash outflow was the result of the acquisition of plant and equipment capital improvements. 
   
 There is no assurance that Barrier will operate profitably or will generate positive cash flow in the future. In addition, Barrier s operating results in the future may be subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors not within our control, such as the unpredictability of when customers will order products, the size of customers' orders, the demand for our products, the level of competition or general economic conditions.  
   
   Current and Future Financing Needs   
 At September 30, 2016, the current cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,030,426; there was $500,000 in available funds to draw on the revolving credit facility, and an additional $60,000 available from the convertible debentures.   
   
 The Company bases its estimate of future cash requirements on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and the requirements for cash are subject to factors, some of which are not within the control of the Company, including: 

Increased costs of general and administrative expenses 
   
 Increased costs of raw materials and freight 
   
 Costs associated with the research and development activities 
   
 Costs associated with maintaining property, plant and equipment and intellectual property 
   
   Related Party Transactions   
 During the year ended June 30, 2012, the Company approved the issuance of two convertible debentures to a director and a company controlled by a director in the amount of $300,000.  The debentures are being issued in tranches from $10,000 - $50,000 and as at September 30, 2016 the Company had received $240,000 (2015:  $240,000) in respect of these debentures.  The debentures bear interest at 12% per annum, payable quarterly, and are collateralized by a third charge over the Company s plant and equipment as well as a charge against the Company s patents.  At any time, the notes are convertible into units of the Company at a price of $0.10 per unit.  Each unit will consist of one common share and one common share purchase warrant entitling the holder the right to purchase one additional share for $0.10 for a period of two years from the conversion date.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred interest charges of $7,200 (2015:  $7,200) on these convertible debentures.  The convertible debentures mature on January 30, 2017.
