1.                   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  Methode Electronics, Inc. was incorporated in 1946 as an Illinois corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1966.  As used herein,  we,   us,   our,  the  Company  or  Methode  means Methode Electronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Our business is managed and our financial results are reported on a segment basis, with those segments being Automotive, Interface, Power Products and Other.  The condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as of   October 29, 2016   and results of operations for the three months and six months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   are unaudited, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  The   April 30, 2016   condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  In our opinion, these financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the results for the interim periods.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended   April 30, 2016  , filed with the SEC on June 23, 2016.  Results may vary from quarter to quarter for reasons other than seasonality. 

2.                   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which is our fiscal 2019, beginning on April 29, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new requirements on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The ASU includes multiples provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which is our fiscal 2018, which will begin on April 30, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new requirements on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting revenue gross versus net), which clarifies gross versus net revenue reporting when another party is involved in the transaction. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which amends the revenue guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. There are two transition methods available under the new standard, either full retrospective or modified retrospective. The standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Earlier adoption is permitted only for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases, ASC 842, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognize based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840 Leases. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, which is our fiscal 2020, beginning on April 28, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The new standard requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which is our fiscal 2019, beginning on April 29, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 Business Combinations Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.   The standard requires that an acquirer recognize measurement-period adjustments in the period in which the adjustments are determined. The income effects of such measurement-period adjustments are to be recorded in the same period s financial statements but calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date. The impact of measurement-period adjustments to earnings that relate to prior period financial statements are to be presented separately on the income statement or disclosed by line item. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, which is our fiscal 2018, which will begin on April 30, 2017. There is currently no impact to the Company expected upon adoption. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This ASU requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, which is our fiscal 2018, which will begin on April 30, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
       
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. Current U.S. GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. This amendment simplifies the presentation to require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction. The guidance was applied prospectively at the beginning of our current fiscal year which began on May 1, 2016.  Prior period information was not adjusted.  The adoption of this standard in fiscal 2017 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-7, Fair Value Measurement: Disclosure for Investments in Certain Entities that calculates net asset value per share (or its Equivalents). This amendment removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net value asset per share. This new guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard in fiscal 2017 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

3.                   GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  We review our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and at least annually in accordance with ASC No. 350, Intangibles   Goodwill and Others.  The values assigned to goodwill and intangible assets are normally based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technologies acquired.  A severe decline in expectations could result in significant impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The estimated aggregate amortization expense for the current fiscal year and each of the   four   succeeding fiscal years is as follows: 

As of   October 29, 2016   and   April 30, 2016  , the trade names, patents and technology licenses include   $1.8   million of trade names that are not subject to amortization. 

4.                   INCOME TAXES 
    
  The Company recognized an income tax provision of   $6.2   million and   $5.7   million for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company's effective tax rate was   19.9%   and   21.2%   for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company recognized an income tax provision of   $11.7   million and   $13.1   million for the six months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company's effective tax rate was   20.2%   and   22.7%   for the six months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  The income tax provision for both the three months and six months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign investment tax credits and foreign operations with lower statutory rates.

5.                   COMMON STOCK AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
    In fiscal 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors authorized a new long-term incentive program for key employees consisting of performance-based Restricted Stock Awards ( RSAs ) and time-based Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ). In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee awarded RSAs and RSUs to our new Chief Financial Officer under the long-term incentive program. He is eligible to earn   24,000   RSA shares at threshold performance,   48,000   shares at target performance and   72,000   shares for maximum performance. In addition, he was awarded   32,000   RSUs. 
    
  In the aggregate, the number of RSAs earned will vary based on performance relative to established goals for fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA, with   50%   of the target shares earned for threshold performance (representing   411,000   shares),   100%   of the target shares earned for target performance (representing   822,000   shares) and   150%   of the target shares earned for maximum performance (representing   1,233,000   shares).  
    
  At the target level of performance, the expected expense for the RSAs over the   five  -year period will be   $24.8   million.  During the three months and six months ended October 29, 2016, the Company recorded   $1.7   million and   $3.0   million, respectively, in compensation expense related to the RSA's.  During the three months and six months ended October 31, 2015, the Company recorded   $0.4   million in compensation expense related to the RSA's. 
       
  As of October 29, 2016, the Company is recording the RSA compensation expense based on target performance.  In future periods, if management makes a determination that exceeding the target is probable for fiscal 2020, a catch-up adjustment to compensation expense will be recorded in that period.  In addition, if management makes a determination that it is not probable the Company will meet the target for fiscal 2020, a reversal of expense will be recorded in that period.  These amounts could be material to the financial statements. 
    
  The Company also granted   608,000   RSU's to key employees.  The RSU s are subject to a   five  -year vesting period, with   30%   vesting on each of April 28, 2018 and April 27, 2019 and   40%   vesting on May 2, 2020.  The total expense for the RSU's is expected to be   $18.5   million through 2020. During the three months and six months ended October 29, 2016, the Company recorded   $1.6   million and    $2.8   million, respectively, of compensation expense related to the RSU's.  During the three months and six months ended October 31, 2015, the Company recorded   $0.4   million in compensation expense related to the RSU's. 
    
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company issued   27,000   shares of common stock to our independent directors, all of which vested immediately upon grant.  We recorded   $1.0 million   of compensation expense related to these shares during the six months ended October 29, 2016.

6.                   NET INCOME PER SHARE 
    
  Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Methode shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period.  Diluted net income per share is calculated after adjusting the denominator of the basic net income per share calculation for the effect of all potentially dilutive stock compensation awards outstanding during the period. 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share: 

For the three months and six months ended   October 29, 2016  , options to purchase   138,500   shares have been excluded in the computation of diluted net income per share because the exercise price was greater than the average market price for those periods, and therefore, would have been anti-dilutive. For the three months and six months ended   October 31, 2015  , options to purchase   158,500   shares have been excluded in the computation of diluted net income per share because the exercise price was greater than the average market price for those periods, and therefore, would have been anti-dilutive.  RSAs for   822,000   shares have been excluded in the computation of diluted net income per share for both the three months and six months ended October 29, 2016, as these awards are contingent on the Company's full year performance in fiscal 2020.

We are from time to time subject to various legal actions and claims incidental to our business, including those arising out of alleged defects, breach of contracts, employment-related matters, environmental matters and intellectual property matters.  We consider insurance coverage and third-party indemnification when determining required accruals for pending litigation and claims.  Although the outcome of potential legal actions and claims cannot be determined, it is our opinion, based on the information available, that we have adequate reserves for these liabilities. 
    
  Hetronic Germany-GmbH Matters     
    
    For several years, Hetronic Germany-GmbH and Hydronic-Steuersysteme-GmbH (the  Fuchs companies ) served as our distributors for Germany, Austria and other central and eastern European countries pursuant to their respective intellectual property licenses and distribution and assembly agreements. We became aware that the Fuchs companies and their managing director, Albert Fuchs, had materially violated those agreements. As a result, we     terminated all of our agreements with the Fuchs companies.   On June 20, 2014, we filed a lawsuit against the Fuchs companies in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging material breaches of the distribution and assembly agreements seeking damages, as well as various forms of injunctive relief. The defendants have filed counterclaims alleging breach of contract, interference with business relations and business slander. On April 2, 2015, we amended our complaint against the Fuchs companies to add additional unfair competition and Lanham Act claims and to add additional affiliated parties.  As of October 29, 2016, the matter remains in the discovery stage.

10.          DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENT 
    
  During the period ended October 29, 2016, we were party to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other financial institutions.  On November 18, 2016, the Company replaced the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a new Credit Agreement.  See Note 11 for more information.  At October 29, 2016, the interest rate on the credit facility was   1.5%   plus   LIBOR   and we were in compliance with the covenants of the agreement.  During the first six months of fiscal 2017, we had   no   borrowings and payments of   $8.6   million, which includes interest of   $0.6   million, under this credit facility.   As of   October 29, 2016  , there were outstanding balances against the credit facility of   $49.0   million.   We believe the fair value approximates the carrying amount as of   October 29, 2016  . 

11.          SUBSEQUENT EVENT 
    
    On November 18, 2016, the Company replaced its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a new Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as L/C Issuer, and the Lenders named therein (the  Credit Agreement ).  In connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 25, 2011 by and among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other financial institutions was terminated. 
    
  The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of November 18, 2021. The credit facility is in the maximum principal amount of   $150.0 million  , with an option to increase the principal amount by up to an additional   $100.0 million  , subject to customary conditions and approval of the lender(s) providing new commitment(s).  The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital and acquisitions.

Cautionary Statement 
    
  Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties.  We undertake no duty to update any such forward-looking statements to conform to actual results or changes in our expectations.  Our business is highly dependent upon two large automotive customers and specific makes and models of vehicles.  Our results will be subject to many of the same risks that apply to the automotive, appliance, computer and communications industries, such as general economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations, consumer spending patterns and technological changes.   Other factors which may result in materially different results for future periods include the following risk factors.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that our management currently believe to be insignificant may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this report because these factors could cause our actual results and condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements in this report are subject to the safe harbor protection provided under the securities laws and are made as of the date of this report. 

Our business is highly dependent on two large automotive customers.  If we were to lose either of these customers or experienced a significant decline in the volume or price of products purchased by these customers, or if either of the customers declare bankruptcy, our future results could be adversely affected. 

Because we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, appliance, computer and communications industries, we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries. 

Our ability to market our automotive products is subject to a lengthy sales cycle, which requires significant investment prior to significant sales revenues, and there is no assurance that our products will be implemented in any particular vehicle. 

Our inability to effectively manage the timing, volume, quality and cost of new program launches could adversely affect our financial performance. 

We are subject to continuing pressure to lower our prices. 

A significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating results. 

A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the United States.

Net sales in Asia increased $0.9 million, or 9.5%, to $10.4 million in the   first half   of fiscal 2017, compared to $9.5 million in the   first half   of fiscal 2016,  due to higher sales volumes of PowerRail        and other busbar products. 
    
  Cost of Products Sold  .  Power Products segment cost of products sold   decreased     $5.0 million  , or   21.6%  , to   $18.1 million   for the   six   months ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $23.1 million   for the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015  .  The Power Products segment cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales   decreased   to   73.9%   for the   six   months ended   October 29, 2016  , from   81.6%   for the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015  .  The decrease primarily relates to higher sales volumes, favorable commodity pricing and implemented overhead cost reductions in the U.S. and China.  In addition, our China operation experienced a favorable currency impact for both material and labor expenses due to the weakening Chinese yuan. 
    
  Gross Profit.    Power Products segment gross profit increased   $1.2 million  , or   23.1%  , to   $6.4 million   in the   first half   of fiscal 2017, compared to   $5.2 million   in the   first half   of fiscal 2016.  Gross margins as a percentage of net sales   increased   to   26.1%   for the   six   months ended   October 29, 2016   from   18.4%   for the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015  .  The increase primarily relates to higher sales volumes, favorable commodity pricing and implemented overhead cost reductions in the U.S. and China.  In addition, our China operation experienced a favorable currency impact for both material and labor expenses due to the weakening Chinese yuan. 
    
  Selling and Administrative Expenses  .  Selling and administrative expenses increased   $0.2 million  , or   11.8%  , to   $1.9 million   for   six   months ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $1.7 million   for the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015  . Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales   increased   to   7.8%   for the   six   months ended   October 29, 2016   from   6.0%   for the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015  ,  primarily due to higher bonus expenses due to the first half of fiscal 2016 benefiting from bonus reversals related to certain operational units not meeting business targets. 

Income From Operations.    Power Products segment income from operations   increased     $1.0 million  , or   28.6%  , to   $4.5 million   for the   six   months ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $3.5 million   for the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015  , due to overhead cost reductions, the favorable currency impact of material purchases, partially offset with decreased sales volumes and higher bonus expenses. 
    
  Other Segment Results 
    
  Below is a table summarizing results for the   six   months ended: 
  ($ in millions) 

Net Sales  .   The operating units in this segment, medical devices, inverters and battery systems, had minimal net sales in the   first half   of fiscal 2017 and in the first half of fiscal 2016 due to newly launched products. 
    
  Cost of Products Sold  .  Other segment cost of products sold was   $2.1 million   for both the six months ended   October 29, 2016   and the six months ended   October 31, 2015  .  
    
  Gross Profit.    The Other segment gross profit was a loss of   $2.0 million   and   $2.1 million   for the six months ended   October 29, 2016   and for the six months ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively.

Selling and Administrative Expenses  .  Selling and administrative expenses   increased     $0.7 million  , or   35.0%  , to   $2.7 million   for the   six   months ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $2.0 million   for the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015  .   The increase primarily is due to higher outside professional fees and marketing expenses related to new product introductions. 
    
  Loss From Operations    The Other segment loss from operations   increased     $0.6 million   to   $4.7 million   for the   six   months ended   October 29, 2016  , compared to   $4.1 million   for the   six   months ended   October 31, 2015  .  The increased loss relates to higher outside professional fees and marketing expenses during the first half of fiscal 2017. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
        
  We believe our current world-wide cash balances together with expected future cash flows to be generated from operations and our committed credit facility will be sufficient to support current operations. A significant amount of cash and expected future cash flows are located outside of the U.S. Of the $249.6 million of cash and cash equivalents as of October 29, 2016, $241.8 million was held in subsidiaries outside the U.S. and all of this amount is deemed to be permanently reinvested and therefore not available to fund our domestic operations. We currently have $2.1 million of federal net operating loss carry-forwards in the U.S. which would reduce the cash tax obligation (if the carry-forward has not otherwise been used) upon any future repatriation of funds. 
    
  During the period ended October 29, 2016, we were party to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain other financial institutions. On November 18, 2016, the Company replaced the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a new Credit Agreement.  See Note 11 for more information.   At October 29, 2016, the interest rate on the credit facility was 1.5% plus LIBOR and we were in compliance with the covenants of the agreement.  During the first half of fiscal 2017, we had no borrowings and payments of $8.6 million, which includes interest of $0.6 million, under this credit facility.   As of   October 29, 2016  , there were outstanding balances against the credit facility of $49.0 million. 
    
  Cash Flow - Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities   increased     $14.6 million   to   $63.7 million   for the first half of fiscal 2017, compared to   $49.1 million   for the first half of fiscal 2016, primarily due to the increased cash generated from the changes in operating assets and liabilities of $8.9 million and the increased non-cash add-back of $4.8 million for stock award amortization expense and an increase in net income of $1.1 million.  The net changes in assets and liabilities resulted in the cash use of $1.0 million in the first half of fiscal 2017, compared to cash use of of $9.9 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. The cash use in the first half of fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by the timing of receivable collections for customer funded tooling, partially offset with reduction in inventory levels. 
    
  Cash Flow - Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities remained constant at   $9.5 million   for both the first half of fiscal 2017, and the first half of fiscal 2016, related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment.   
    
  Cash Flow - Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash used by financing activities increased   $7.6 million   to   $23.5 million   in the first half of fiscal   2017  , compared to   $15.9 million   for the first half of fiscal   2016  .  In September 2015, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of the company outstanding stock through September 1, 2017. During the first half of fiscal 2017 and the first half of fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased $9.8 and $22.8 million, respectively, related to the plan.  During the first half of fiscal   2017  , the Company had repayment of borrowings against the credit facility of   $8.0 million  , and during the first half of fiscal 2016, the Company had net borrowings of $17.0 million.  We paid dividends of   $6.6 million   and   $6.9 million   in the first half of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.  The first half of  fiscal 2017 and the first half of fiscal 2016 includes $1.1 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. There were proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.5 million in the first half of fiscal 2017 and $0.4 million in the first half of fiscal 2016.  The first half of fiscal 2017 and the first half of fiscal 2016 includes $0.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of excess tax benefit on equity shares issued and on stock options exercised during those periods.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases and purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business. 

Item 3.  Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Certain of our foreign operations enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency, primarily the U.S. dollar and the euro.  A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels could impact our income before income taxes by $8.7 million as of   October 29, 2016   and   April 30, 2016  .  We also have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign operations to U.S. dollars.  We generally view our investments in foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar as long-term.  The currencies to which we are exposed are the British pound, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar and Swiss franc.  A 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels could impact our net foreign investments by $37.5 million at   October 29, 2016   and $35.3 million at   April 30, 2016  . 
    
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. The interest rate risk for our credit agreement, under which we had $49.0 million of net borrowings at   October 29, 2016  , is variable and is determined based on LIBOR. We estimate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations for fiscal 2017 based upon our current and expected levels of our debt. 

Item 4.  Controls And Procedures 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s applicable rules and forms.  As a result of this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   October 29, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.         OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  Other than the supplemental risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I - Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. 
  Any attempt by President-elect Trump to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA and certain other international trade agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and China.  During the election campaign, President-elect Trump made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ).  At this time, it remains unclear what President-elect Trump would or would not do with respect to these international trade agreements.  If President-elect Trump takes action to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or certain other international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
    
  Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

(1)    In September 2015, the Company adopted a plan to repurchase up to $100.0 million of its common stock.  The plan expires September 1, 2017.
