NOTES TO (UNAUDITED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1.   
       Organization and Business    

Cloud Security Corporation,
formerly Accend Media (the  Company ), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 20, 2010. On May 22, 2012,
the Company merged with Cloud Star Corporation ( Cloud Star ), a privately held Nevada corporation incorporated on
October 17, 2011 headquartered in California (the  Merger ). Cloud Star s then Chief Executive Officer assigned
his rights and interests in technology named  The VirtualKey Desktop Solution  ( MyComputerKey ) and additional
cloud security technology products to the Company in connection with the Merger. Following the Merger, the Company conducted the
business of Cloud Star and changed its name from  Accend Media  to  Cloud Star Corporation . On May 28,
2013, the Company changed its corporate name to  Cloud Security Corporation . 

The Company s
principal business has been the software development of MyComputerKey; however, due to cash flow constraints, we were unable to
proceed with development in fiscal 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the software infrastructure and interface for MyComputerKey,
Phase 1 (version 3) of MyComputerKey and additional cloud computing security applications. During 2016, the Company received a
patent and is continuing to evaluate its intellectual property and business strategies including raising additional capital for
further development of our product, MyComputerKey , entering into third party development agreements for additional product
enhancements, developing additional products, creating and implementing marketing strategies for the sale of our product and raise
brand awareness, entering into partnership or distribution agreements, or even an outright sale of our intellectual property. 

Stock Purchase Agreement  

On December 8, 2014,
the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the  SPA ) with Goldenrise Development, Inc., a California corporation
( Goldenrise ) whereby the Company sold 12,000,000 shares of its common stock for $180,000 to Goldenrise representing
approximately 92% of our outstanding shares. In connection with the SPA, we also agreed to effectuate a 1:100 reverse stock split
of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock ( Reverse Split ) which became effective on January 22,
2015. The Company s then directors and officers immediately preceding the close of this transaction resigned at closing.
Goldenrise designated the current directors and officers of the Company. The transaction effectuated a change in control of the
Company. 

In connection with
the SPA, the Company also entered into a Consulting Agreement with its then Chief Executive Officer, Safa Movassaghi, whereby,
at closing of the SPA, Mr. Movassaghi remained with the Company as a consultant for a period of six (6) months to continue the
development of the Company s mobile software cloud security business. The Consulting Agreement with Mr. Movassaghi expired
on June 8, 2015. During the three and six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company had no active employees. 

2.   
       Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited
interim financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities
Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America have been condensed or
omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair
presentation of these financial statements have been included. Such adjustments consist of normal recurring adjustments. These
interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and related notes thereto of
the Company filed with the SEC including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 filed with
the SEC on June 10, 2016. The results of operations for the three and six months ended August 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the full year. 

Going Concern Considerations and Management s
Plans  

The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which
contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has no revenues, has incurred net losses
and has an accumulated deficit of $1,738,505 as of August 31, 2016. The Company currently has limited liquidity and limited
access to capital. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is
unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations. 

Management anticipates the
Company will be dependent, for the foreseeable future, on additional capital to fund further development of our infrastructure
and to fund operations until such time we have sufficient revenues to meet our cost structure. Additional capital is required in
order to acquire source code developed by consultants retained to complete the project and to ultimately launch our anticipated
products in the marketplace. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be
successful in obtaining sufficient capital to continue as a going concern. 

The ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the
preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

New Accounting Pronouncements  

We have reviewed all
recently issued accounting pronouncements and these were disclosed in the Company s most recently filed Form 10-K or are
not believed by us to have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements, based on our current operations. 

3.   
       Prepaid Expenses    

The Company capitalized
its annual fees of $10,000 for its OTC Markets listing which benefits the year June 1, 2016 to May 31, 2017 and is being amortized
over such period. During the three and six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company recorded amortization expense of $2,500 and
$2,500, respectively. 

4.   
       Stockholders  Deficit    

Authorizations and Designations  

The Company is authorized
to issue 190,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock and 10,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value preferred stock.
As of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, no preferred stock has been issued. 

2014 Stock Incentive Plan  

The Board of Directors
adopted the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ). The Plan provides for the grant, at the discretion of the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors, of stock awards, of common stock, restricted stock, awards of common stock, or stock options
to purchase common stock of the Company, with a maximum of 150,000 shares. As of August 31, 2016, 131,875 shares are available
for issuance under the Plan. 

Capital Contributions  

During the six months
ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, Goldenrise contributed $50,000 and $30,000, respectively to fund business operations.

Overview of Current Operations  

We are an early stage
security and information access technology software company that delivers immediate information with ease and secure access to
computer desktops and other consumer electronic devices from remote locations. 

Our principal business
has been the software development of MyComputerKey  however, due to cash flow constraints, we were unable to proceed with
development in fiscal 2015. We are currently evaluating the software infrastructure and interface for MyComputerKey , Phase
1 (version 3) of MyComputerKey  and additional cloud computing security applications. 

On December 8, 2014,
we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the  SPA ) with Goldenrise Development, Inc., a California corporation
( Goldenrise ) whereby we sold 12,000,000 shares of our common stock for $180,000 to Goldenrise representing approximately
92% of our outstanding shares. In connection with the SPA, we also agreed to effectuate a 1:100 reverse stock split of the Company s
issued and outstanding common stock ( Reverse Split ) which became effective on January 22, 2015. Our then directors
and officers immediately preceding the close of this transaction resigned at closing. Goldenrise designated our current directors
and officers. This transaction effectuated a change in control. 

In connection with
the SPA, we also entered into a Consulting Agreement with Safa Movassaghi, the then current Chief Executive Officer whereby, at
closing of the SPA, Mr. Movassaghi agreed to remain with us as a consultant for a period of six (6) months to continue the development
of our mobile software cloud security business. The Consulting Agreement with Mr. Movassaghi expired on June 8, 2015 and was not
renewed. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Three Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared
to the Three Months Ended August 31, 2015  

We had no revenues
during the three month periods ending August 31, 2016 or 2015. 

During the three month
period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $20,746 and $23,222, respectively. During
these periods we incurred accounting, legal and other costs associates with being a publicly traded company. 

During the three month
period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, our net loss was $20,746 and $23,222, respectively, total decrease of $2,476. The decrease
was attributable to lower general and administration costs as described above. 

Six Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared
to the Six Months Ended August 31, 2015  

We had no revenues
during the three month periods ending August 31, 2016 or 2015. 

During the six month
period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $39,625 and $43,784, respectively. During
the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period, we reduced our legal, stock transfer agent and related costs by $22,291. During the
2015 period, we recorded a reversal of estimates of previously accrued compensation and related taxes of $19,603. 

During the six month
period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, our net loss was $39,625 and $43,784, respectively, total decrease of $4,159. The decrease
was attributable to lower general and administration costs as described above. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

As of August 31, 2016,
we had cash and cash equivalents of $4,279 and a working capital deficit of $17,436 as compared to cash and cash equivalents of
$2,680 and a working capital deficit of $27,811 as of February 29, 2016. 

We had total liabilities
of $29,390 as of August 31, 2016, consisting of accounts payable. At February 29, 2016, our total liabilities were $30,666. 

We had a total stockholders 
deficit of $17,436 and an accumulated deficit of $1,738,505 as of August 31, 2016, as compared to $27,811 and $1,698,880, respectively,
as of February 29, 2016. 

We used $48,401 of
cash in operating activities for the six months ended August 31, 2016, which was attributable primarily to our net loss of $39,625
and a prepayment $10,000 for certain public company costs. In comparison, we used $86,427 of cash in operating activities for the
six months ended August 31, 2015. 

During the six months
ended August 31, 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $50,000 as we received such amounts in capital contributions from
Goldenrise. Cash from financing activities for the six month period ended August 31, 2015 was $87,037 and consisted of $30,000
in capital contributions from Goldenrise and $57,037 in proceeds received from the sale of stock in during 2014. 

Additional capital
is required in order to acquire the source code developed by the third party developers retained to complete the MyComputerKey 
project. Management is in negotiations with these developers to resolve and restructure the original contract. 

Since we have no liquidity
and have suffered losses, we depend to a great degree on the ability to attract external financing in order to conduct our business
activities and expand our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. If we are unable to raise additional capital from conventional sources, including increases in related party and
non-related party loans and/or additional sales of stock, we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations. Even if we
are able to continue our operations, the failure to obtain financing could have a substantial adverse effect on our business and
financial results, including our inability to acquire the source code for Phase 1 (Version 3) of our MyComputerKey  product.
We have no commitments to provide us with financing in the future, other than described above. Our independent registered public
accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. 

Notwithstanding, we
anticipate generating losses and therefore may be unable to continue operations in the future. We anticipate that we will require
additional capital in order to grow our business by increasing headcount and our budget for fiscal year ending 2017. We may use
a combination of equity and/or debt instruments to funds our growth strategy or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third
party. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

None. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results or operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

Our disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ), are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the SEC, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Management, with the
participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of August 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
and Procedures  

In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure
controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
