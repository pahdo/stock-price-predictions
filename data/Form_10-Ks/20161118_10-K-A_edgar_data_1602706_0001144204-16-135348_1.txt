EXPLANATORY NOTE  

Longbau Group, Inc. (the  Company )
is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (the  Amendment ) to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015 (the  Original Filing ), which was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ) on April 4, 2016. 

We are filing this Amendment in response
to a comment letter received from the SEC in connection with its review of the Original Filing (the  Comment Letter ).
We have revised Part II, Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures  in this Amendment to include in the assessment
by our management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, a statement as to whether or not internal control over financial reporting was effective. In addition, we are
also including the certifications required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 in connection with the filing of this Amendment. 

This Amendment does not include the entire
Form 10-K. Except as described in this Explanatory Note, this Amendment does not amend any other information set forth in the Original
Filing, and the Company has not updated disclosures to reflect any events that occurred subsequent to April 4, 2016.

ITEM 9A.  
      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

(a)    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term  disclosure
controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures
of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports, such as this report,
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily
applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation,
Tsai Ko, our Chief Executive Officer and Yueh-Kuei Ko, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as of December
31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the following material weaknesses in our control environment
and financial reporting process consisting of the following as of December 31, 2015: 

1) 
     lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal control and procedures;  

2) 
     inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives;  

3) 
     ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes; and  

4) 
     lack of accounting personnel with adequate experience and training.  

(b)   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  

During the three months ended December
31, 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation performed
during the fourth quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

(c)   Management s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting.  

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The
internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management's review and approval of all transactions.  Our
internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
     pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;  

(2) 
     provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and  

(3) 
     provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management's assessment
included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness
of these controls. 

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of
December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weaknesses in our control
environment and financial reporting process mentioned above. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of
the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not
subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to the Company s status as an emerging
growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.
