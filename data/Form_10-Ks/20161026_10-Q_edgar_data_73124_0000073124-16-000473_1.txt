  THIRD   QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
  General 
  Northern Trust Corporation (the Corporation) is a financial holding company that is a leading provider of asset servicing, fund administration, asset management, fiduciary and banking solutions for corporations, institutions, families and individuals worldwide. The Corporation focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Corporate   Institutional Services (C IS) and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. Except where the context requires otherwise, the term  Northern Trust,   we,   us,   our  or similar terms mean the Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 
  The following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in this report. Investors also should read the section entitled  Forward-Looking Statements.  
   
  Overview 
  Net income per diluted common share was   $1.08   in the current quarter, up from   $0.96   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Net income was   $257.6 million   in the current quarter as compared to   $234.6 million   in the prior-year quarter. Annualized return on average common equity in the current quarter was   11.7%  , up from   10.9%   in the prior-year quarter. The annualized return on average assets was   0.9%   as compared to   0.8%   in the prior-year quarter. 
    
  Revenue of   $1.21 billion   was up   $58.2 million  , or   5%  , from   $1.16 billion   in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher  trust, investment and other servicing fees and net interest income, partially offset by lower foreign exchange trading income and other operating income. Noninterest income increased   $24.0 million  , or   3%  , to   $910.6 million   from   $886.6 million   in the prior-year quarter. 
    
  Net interest income increased   13%   to   $303.1 million   in the current quarter as compared to   $268.9 million   in the prior-year quarter, due to a higher net interest margin and growth in earning assets.  
    
  The provision for credit losses was a credit of   $3.0 million   in the current quarter, as compared to a credit provision of   $10.0 million   in the prior-year quarter. 
    
  Noninterest expense totaled   $843.0 million  , up   $30.7 million  , or   4%  , from   $812.3 million   in the prior-year quarter, primarily attributable to higher compensation, other operating expense, and employee benefits. 
   
  The components of noninterest income are provided below. 
  Table 1: Noninterest Income    

Trust, investment and other servicing fees are based primarily on: the market value of assets held in custody, managed or serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered. Certain market-value-based fees are calculated on asset values that are a month or quarter in arrears. For a further discussion of trust, investment and other servicing fees and how they are derived, refer to the  Reporting Segments  section.

Assets under custody/administration (AUC/A) and assets under management form the primary drivers of our trust, investment and other servicing fees. For the purposes of disclosing AUC/A, to the extent that both custody and administration services are provided, the value of the assets is included only once. At   September 30, 2016  , AUC/A were   $8.50 trillion  , up   $379.9 billion  , or   5%  , from   $8.12 trillion   at   June 30, 2016  .  
  The following table presents Northern Trust s assets under custody, a component of AUC/A, by reporting segment.

The following table presents the allocation of Northern Trust s custodied assets by reporting segment.

The   13%   increase in consolidated assets under custody from   $5.96 trillion   as of   September 30, 2015   to   $6.71 trillion   as of   September 30, 2016   primarily reflected the impact of favorable markets and new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements.

The   7%   increase in consolidated assets under management from   $886.8 billion   at   September 30, 2015   to   $945.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to favorable global equity markets and inflows in cash, equity and fixed income products, partially offset by lower securities lending collateral. 
  Changes in assets under custody and under management are in comparison to the twelve-month increase in the S P 500 index of   12.9%   and increase in the MSCI EAFE index (USD) of   3.5%  .

Foreign exchange trading income totaled   $53.6 million   in the current quarter, down   $9.3 million  , or   15%  , compared to   $62.9 million   in the prior-year quarter.  The decrease generally reflected lower client volumes as compared to the prior-year quarter.

    Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks includes the interest-bearing component of Cash and Due from Banks and Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks as presented on the consolidated balance sheets. 
              (2) 
    Other securities include certain community development investments and Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve stock, which are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
              (3) 
    Average balances include nonaccrual loans. Lease financing receivable balances are reduced by deferred income. 
              (4) 
    Cash and Due from Banks and Other Central Bank Deposits includes the non-interest-bearing component of Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits as presented on the consolidated balance sheets on page 31. 
              (5) 
    Rate calculations are based on actual balances rather than the rounded amounts presented in the Average Consolidated Balance Sheets with Analysis of Net Interest Income. 
       
           Notes: 
    Net Interest Income (FTE Adjusted), a non-generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) financial measure, includes adjustments to a fully taxable equivalent basis for loans and securities. Such adjustments are based on a blended federal and state tax rate of   37.8%   and   37.6%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Total taxable equivalent interest adjustments amounted to   $7.0 million   and   $6.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. A reconciliation of net interest income and net interest margin on a GAAP basis to net interest income and net interest margin on an FTE basis (each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure) is provided on page 28. 
     Interest revenue on cash collateral positions is reported above within interest-bearing deposits with banks and within loans and leases. Interest expense on cash collateral positions is reported above within non-U.S. offices interest-bearing deposits. Related cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties is recorded net of the associated derivative contract within other assets and other liabilities, respectively. 
  Net interest income is defined as the total of interest income and amortized fees on earning assets, less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. 
  Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis totaled   $310.1 million  , up   $35.1 million  , or   13%  , compared to   $275.0 million   in the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily the result of a higher net interest margin and growth in average earning assets. Average earning assets for the current quarter averaged   $107.8 billion  , up   $7.0 billion  , or   7%  , from   $100.8 billion   in the prior-year quarter, primarily resulting from higher levels of securities. Earning asset growth was funded primarily by a higher level of borrowed funds and interest-bearing and demand deposits. 
  The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased to   1.14%   in the current quarter from   1.08%   in the prior-year quarter due to higher yields on earning assets driven by the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by higher premium amortization. 
  When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. A reconciliation of net interest income and net interest margin on a GAAP basis to net interest income and net interest margin on an FTE basis (each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure) is provided on page 28. 
  Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits averaged   $20.8 billion  , up   $3.5 billion  , or   20%  , from   $17.3 billion   in the prior-year quarter. Average securities were   $43.3 billion  , up   $5.3 billion  , or   14%  , from   $38.0 billion   in the prior-year quarter and include certain community development investments, Federal Home Loan Bank stock,  and Federal Reserve stock of   $180.0 million  ,   $179.6 million   and   $53.1 million  , respectively, which are recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
  Loans and leases averaged   $33.9 billion  , up   $771.8 million  , or   2%  , from   $33.1 billion   in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher levels of private client loans, commercial and institutional loans, and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by reductions in residential real estate loans. Private client loans averaged   $9.9 billion  , up   $1.5 billion  , or   18%  , from   $8.4 billion   for the prior-year quarter. Commercial and institutional loans averaged   $10.0 billion  , up   $845.9 million  , or   9%  , from   $9.2 billion   for the prior-year quarter. Commercial real estate loans averaged   $4.0 billion  , up   $294.9 million  , or   8%  , from   $3.7 billion   for the prior-year quarter.  Residential real estate loans averaged   $8.3 billion  , down   $934.6 million  , or   10%  , from   $9.2 billion   for the prior-year quarter.

  THIRD QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 
  Net Interest Income (continued) 

Northern Trust utilizes a diverse mix of funding sources. Total interest-bearing deposits averaged   $67.9 billion  , compared to   $66.8 billion   in the prior-year quarter, an increase of   $1.1 billion  . Other interest-bearing funds averaged   $10.1 billion  , an increase of   $3.1 billion  , from   $7.0 billion   in the prior-year quarter, primarily attributable to increased short-term borrowings. The balances within short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes in the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. Average net noninterest-related funds utilized to fund earning assets increased   $2.7 billion  , or   10%  , to   $29.8 billion   from   $27.0 billion   in the prior-year quarter, primarily resulting from higher levels of demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits. 
   
  Provision for Credit Losses 
  The provision for credit losses was a credit of   $3.0 million   in the current quarter, as compared to a credit provision of   $10.0 million   in the prior-year quarter. Net recoveries in the current quarter were   $0.8 million  , resulting from charge-offs of   $3.0 million   and recoveries of   $3.8 million  . The prior-year quarter included   $9.4 million   of net charge-offs, resulting from   $11.9 million   of charge-offs and   $2.5 million   of recoveries. Nonperforming assets of   $181.0 million   decreased   13%   from the prior-year quarter. Residential real estate loans and commercial loans accounted for   57%   and   35%  , respectively, of total nonperforming loans and leases at   September 30, 2016  . For additional discussion of the provision and allowance for credit losses, refer to the  Asset Quality  section beginning on page 22. 
   
  Noninterest Expense 
  The components of noninterest expense are provided below. 
  Table 10: Noninterest Expense    

Compensation expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, totaled   $382.1 million   in the current quarter, compared to    $361.6 million   in the prior-year quarter. Compensation expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher staff levels and increased performance-based incentive compensation. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis at   September 30, 2016   totaled approximately   16,900  , up   6%   from   September 30, 2015  . 
  Employee benefits expense totaled   $73.2 million   in the current quarter, compared to   $69.8 million   in the prior-year quarter. Employee benefits expense increased   5%   compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher medical expense, partially offset by lower pension expense.

  THIRD QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 
  Noninterest Expense (continued) 

Other operating expense totaled   $71.4 million   in the current quarter, up   9%   from   $65.3 million   in the prior-year quarter, reflecting a   $3.5 million   charge in connection with the settlement of certain securities lending litigation as well as higher FDIC deposit protection expense. The components of other operating expense are provided below. 
  Table 11: Other Operating Expense    

Provision for Income Taxes 
  Income tax expense was   $116.1 million   in the current quarter, representing an effective tax rate of   31.1%  , compared to   $118.6 million   in the prior-year quarter, representing an effective tax rate of   33.6%  . The decrease in the provision for income taxes compared to the prior-year quarter was based on a lower effective tax rate driven by changes in the earnings mix in tax jurisdictions in which the Corporation operates, partially offset by increased income before income taxes. In addition, the provision for income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 includes a   $6.4 million   benefit related to excess tax benefits recognized in the provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in capital as a result of the Corporation s early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. 
   
  REPORTING SEGMENTS 
  Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: C IS and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to C IS and Wealth Management. Income and expense associated with the wholesale funding activities and investment portfolios of the Corporation and its principal subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company (the Bank), as well as certain corporate-based expense, executive level compensation and nonrecurring items, are not allocated to C IS and Wealth Management, and are reported in Northern Trust s third reporting segment, Treasury and Other, in the following pages.

C IS net income totaled   $132.1 million   in the current quarter compared to   $124.1 million   in the prior-year quarter, an increase of   $8.0 million  , or   6%  . Noninterest income was $  547.5 million   in the current quarter, up $  11.9 million  , or   2%  , from $  535.6 million   in the prior-year quarter, reflecting higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, partially offset by lower foreign exchange trading income and other operating income. The following table provides a summary of C IS trust, investment and other servicing fees. 
  Table 13: C IS Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees    

Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C IS fees, are driven primarily by values of client AUC/A, transaction volumes and number of accounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. Custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on quarter-end or month-end values, values at the beginning of each quarter or average values for a month or quarter. The fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. Investment management fees, which are based generally on client assets under management, are based primarily on market values throughout a period. 
  Custody and fund administration fees increased from the prior-year quarter, as new business was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and equity markets. Investment management fees increased   $11.8 million  , or   14%  , primarily due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. There were   no   C IS money market mutual fund fee waivers in the current quarter compared to $  12.2 million   in the prior-year quarter.  Securities lending fees increased primarily reflecting higher spreads in the current quarter.   
  Foreign exchange trading income totaled $  55.2 million   in the current quarter, a decrease of   $4.8 million  , or   8%  , from $  60.0 million   in the prior-year quarter. The decrease generally reflected lower client volumes as compared to the prior-year quarter. 
  Other noninterest income in C IS totaled $  41.5 million   in the current quarter, down   $4.4 million  , or   10%  , from $  45.9 million   in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting impairment charges and loss on sales related to a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio. 
  For the prior-year quarter, the presentation of average assets was changed to reflect a modification to the methodology by which assets are allocated among our reporting segments. For C IS, this change in presentation resulted in an increase to average assets and a reduction in the net interest margin.  
  Net interest income stated on an FTE basis was $  138.2 million   in the current quarter, up   $29.6 million  , or   27%  , from $  108.6 million   in the prior-year quarter. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the net interest margin to   0.79%   from   0.64%   in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher yields on earning assets. The average earning assets totaled   $69.2 billion  , up from $  67.0 billion   in the prior-year quarter. The earning assets in C IS consisted primarily of intercompany assets and loans and leases. Funding sources were primarily comprised of non-U.S. custody-related interest-bearing deposits, which averaged   $45.2 billion   in the current quarter, down slightly from $  45.7 billion   in the prior-year quarter. 
  The provision for credit losses was a provision of $  4.0 million   in the current quarter, compared with a credit provision of $  2.8 million     in the prior-year quarter, reflecting a specific reserve requirement, partially offset by continued improvement in credit quality.  
  Total C IS noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, totaled $  487.8 million   in the current quarter, up   $23.2 million  , or   5%  , from $  464.6 million   in the prior-year quarter. The increase in noninterest expense

was primarily attributable to higher compensation expense, indirect expense allocations, and employee benefits, partially offset by lower outside services.  
   
  Wealth Management 
  Wealth Management net income was   $135.5 million   in the current quarter, up   18%   from   $115.0 million   in the prior-year quarter. Noninterest income was $  364.7 million  , up from $  350.6 million   in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, partially offset by lower foreign exchange trading income and other noninterest income. Trust, investment and other servicing fees in Wealth Management totaled   $337.5 million   in the current quarter, increasing   $18.1 million  , or   6%  , from   $319.4 million   in the prior-year quarter. The following table provides a summary of Wealth Management trust, investment and other servicing fees. 
  Table 14: Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees    

Wealth Management fee income is calculated primarily based on market values. The increase in Wealth Management fees across all regions was primarily attributable to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and favorable equity markets.  Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled   $0.2 million   in the current quarter compared to   $15.3 million   in the prior-year quarter. 
  Foreign exchange trading income totaled   $0.9 million  , down   69%   from   $2.9 million   in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting decreased client activity. 
  Other noninterest income of   $26.3 million   in the current quarter was down from   $28.3 million   in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting a decrease in security commission and trading income. 
  For the prior-year quarter, the presentation of average assets was changed to reflect a modification to the methodology by which assets are allocated among our reporting segments. This change in presentation did not have a significant impact on the Wealth Management reporting segment.  
  Net interest income stated on an FTE basis was $  164.1 million   in the current quarter, up   $21.6 million  , or   15%  , from $  142.5 million   in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in the net interest margin and higher levels of average earning assets. The net interest margin increased to   2.47%   from   2.26%   in the prior-year quarter. Average earning assets increased   $1.4 billion  , or   5%  , to   $26.4 billion   from the prior-year quarter s $  25.0 billion  . Earning assets and funding sources were primarily comprised of loans and domestic retail interest-bearing deposits, respectively. 
  The provision for credit losses was a credit provision of $  7.0 million   in the current quarter, compared with a credit provision of $  7.2 million   in the prior-year quarter, which reflected continued improvement in credit quality.  
  Total noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, totaled $  318.0 million   in the current quarter, compared to $  316.3 million   in the prior-year quarter, an increase of   $1.7 million  , or   1%  , primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and indirect expense allocations, partially offset by other operating expense.

  Treasury and Other 

Treasury and Other includes income and expense associated with the wholesale funding activities and the investment portfolios of the Corporation and the Bank, and certain corporate-based expenses, executive-level compensation and nonrecurring items not allocated to C IS and Wealth Management.  
  Treasury and Other noninterest income was negative   $1.6 million   in the current quarter, down   $2.0 million   from   $0.4 million   in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower foreign exchange trading income. 
  For the prior-year quarter, the presentation of average assets was changed to reflect a modification to the methodology by which assets are allocated among our reporting segments. For Treasury and Other, this change in presentation resulted in a decrease to average assets and an increase in the net interest margin.  
  Net interest income decreased   $16.1 million  , or   67%  , to $  7.8 million   in the current quarter, compared to $  23.9 million   in the prior-year quarter. The decrease reflected a decline in the net interest margin, partially offset by higher levels of earning assets. Average earning assets increased   $3.4 billion   to   $12.3 billion   from the prior-year quarter s $  8.8 billion  .  
  Noninterest expense totaled $  37.2 million   in the current quarter, up   $5.8 million  , or   18%  , from $  31.4 million   in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher general overhead costs, including compensation expense and outside services, partially offset by lower indirect expense allocations to C IS and Wealth Management, as compared to the prior-year quarter.  
   
  NINE  -MONTH CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
  Overview 
  The Corporation early adopted ASU No. 2016-09 on July 1, 2016, with an effective date of January 1, 2016, which resulted in a reclassification of   $5.9 million   from additional paid-in capital to provision for income taxes, representing excess tax benefits previously recognized in additional paid-in capital during the six months ended June 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recognized a benefit of   $6.4 million   in provision for income taxes for excess tax benefits that occurred in the current quarter. The early adoption favorably impacted net income per diluted common share by   $0.06   per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
  Net income per diluted common share was   $3.21   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and   $3.00   in the comparable prior-year period. Net income totaled   $766.0 million  , up slightly as compared to   $734.5 million   in the prior-year period. The performance in the current period produced an annualized return on average common equity of   11.9%  , compared to   11.7%   in the prior-year period. The annualized return on average assets was   0.9%   in both the current and prior-year periods. 
    
  The three months ended June 30, 2016 included a gain on the sale of 1.1 million Visa Inc. Class B common shares, net of the valuation adjustment to existing swap agreements, totaling   $118.2 million  ; a charge in connection with an agreement to settle certain securities lending litigation of   $46.5 million  ; charges related to contractual modifications associated with existing C IS clients of   $18.6 million  ; severance, other personnel and related charges of   $17.5 million  ; impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio of   $14.1 million  ; and impairment charges related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars of   $7.5 million  .  Excluding these items, net income per diluted common share, net income and return on average common equity during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $3.17  ,   $758.0 million   and   11.7%  , respectively. 
  The prior period included a net gain on the sale of 1.0 million Visa Inc. Class B common shares totaling   $99.9 million  ; voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar NAV funds of   $45.8 million  ; and the impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft under leveraged lease agreements of   $17.8 million  . Excluding the gain and charges, net income per diluted common share, net income, and return on average common equity were   $2.91  ,   $712.1 million   and   11.3%  , respectively. 
  Revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $3.72 billion  , up   $174.5 million  , or   5%  , as compared to   $3.55 billion   in the prior-year period, primarily driven by increased net interest income and trust, investment and other servicing fees, partially offset by lower foreign exchange trading income. Noninterest income was   $2.81 billion  , up   $44.6 million  , or   2%  , from   $2.77 billion   in the prior-year period. 
    
  Net interest income increased   17%   to   $910.6 million   in the current period as compared to   $780.7 million   in the prior-year period, due to a higher net interest margin and growth in earning assets.  Additionally, the three months ended June 30, 2016 included a

charge of   $2.7 million   related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars. The prior-year period included a charge of   $17.8 million   related to the residual value of certain aircraft under leveraged lease agreements. 
    
  The provision for credit losses was a credit of   $4.0 million   in the current period, as compared to a credit provision of   $24.5 million   in the prior-year period. 
    
  Noninterest expense totaled   $2.6 billion  , up   $141.0 million  , or   6%  , from   $2.5 billion   in the prior-year period.

The prior-year quarter included the   $45.8 million   charge related to voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar NAV funds. Excluding the current- and prior-year period charges, noninterest expense increased   $104.2 million  , or   4%  , primarily attributable to higher compensation, outside services expense, and a charge in connection with the settlement of the one remaining securities lending litigation claim related to the 2008 financial crisis. 
   
  Noninterest Income 
  The components of noninterest income are provided below. 
  Table 15: Nine Months Ended September 30 Noninterest Income    

As illustrated in the following table, trust, investment and other servicing fees from C IS increased   $62.1 million  , or   5%  , totaling   $1.33 billion  , compared to   $1.27 billion   a year ago. 
  Table 16: Nine Months Ended September 30 C IS Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees    

Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C IS fees, increased   2%  , primarily driven by new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets and movements in foreign exchange rates. C IS investment management fees increased   16%  , primarily due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in C IS totaled   $1.9 million  , compared to waived fees of   $41.0 million   in the prior-year period. Other fees in C IS increased   5%  , primarily due to new business related to investment risk and analytical services and increased other ancillary services.

As illustrated in the following table, trust, investment and other servicing fees from Wealth Management totaled   $982.6 million  , up from   $964.4 million   a year ago. 
  Table 17: Nine Months Ended September 30 Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees    

The net increase in Wealth Management fees, driven by Global Family Office, was primarily attributable to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers in the current period. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled   $6.2 million   compared with   $47.6 million   in the prior-year period. 
  Foreign exchange trading income decreased   $30.8 million  , or   15%  , and totaled   $178.5 million   compared with   $209.3 million   in the prior-year period. The decrease was attributable to lower client volumes compared to the prior-year period. 
  Other operating income decreased   1%   to   $212.4 million   compared with   $214.1 million   in the prior-year period. The components of other operating income are provided below.

The current-year period other income included the gain on the sale of 1.1 million Visa Inc. Class B common shares, net of the valuation adjustment to existing swap agreements, totaling   $118.2 million  , offset by impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio as well as impairment charges related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars of   $18.9 million   in the three months ended June 30, 2016. The prior-year period other income included a   $99.9 million   net gain on the sale of a portion of the Visa Inc. Class B common shares held by the Corporation. Excluding these items, other operating income decreased   1%   from the prior-year period, primarily due to impairment charges and loss on sales related to a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio, partially offset by income associated with supplemental compensation plans.

    Rate calculations are based on actual balances rather than the rounded amounts presented in the Average Consolidated Balance Sheets with Analysis of Net Interest Income. 
       
           Notes: 
    Net Interest Income (FTE Adjusted), a non-generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) financial measure, includes adjustments to a fully taxable equivalent basis for loans and securities. Such adjustments are based on a blended federal and state tax rate of   37.8%   and   37.6%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Total taxable equivalent interest adjustments amounted to   $20.1 million   and   $18.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. A reconciliation of net interest income and net interest margin on a GAAP basis to net interest income and net interest margin on an FTE basis (each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure) is provided on page 28. 
     Interest revenue on cash collateral positions is reported above within interest-bearing deposits with banks and within loans and leases. Interest expense on cash collateral positions is reported above within non-U.S. offices interest-bearing deposits. Related cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties is recorded net of the associated derivative contract within other assets and other liabilities, respectively. 
  Net interest income, stated on an FTE basis, totaled   $930.7 million  , an increase of   $131.3 million  , or   16%  , from   $799.4 million   reported in the prior-year period. The increase is the result of growth in earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Additionally, the three months ended June 30, 2016 included a charge of   $2.7 million   related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars.  The prior-year period included a charge of   $17.8 million   related to the residual value of certain aircraft under leveraged lease agreements. Average earning assets were   $106.4 billion  , up   $5.3 billion  , or   5%  , from   $101.1 billion   in the prior-year period, primarily attributable to higher levels of securities and loans. The net interest margin, on an FTE basis, increased to   1.17%   from   1.06%   in the prior-year period. Excluding the impairments, the net interest margin was   1.17%   and   1.08%  , respectively, primarily reflecting higher yields on earning assets. 
   
  Provision for Credit Losses 
  The provision for credit losses was a credit of   $4.0 million   in the current-year period, compared to a credit provision of   $24.5 million   in the prior-year period. Net charge-offs in the current-year period totaled   $4.3 million   resulting from   $13.2 million   of charge-offs and   $8.9 million   of recoveries, compared to net charge-offs of   $16.6 million   in the prior-year period resulting from   $25.5 million   of charge-offs and   $8.9 million   of recoveries. The current period provision reflects improved credit quality. Residential real estate loans continued to reflect weakness relative to the overall portfolio, accounting for   57%   and   77%   of total nonperforming loans and leases at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Loan balances within the private client, commercial real estate and non-U.S. loan portfolios increased in the current period, while the residential real estate loan balance decreased. For a fuller discussion of the consolidated allowance and provision for credit losses refer to the  Asset Quality  section beginning on page 22.

Excluding the severance and related charges, compensation expense increased   $59.6 million  , or   6%  , compared to the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher salary expense and performance-based incentive compensation.  
  Employee benefits expense of   $216.0 million   was relatively unchanged from   $215.9 million   in the prior-year period. Employee benefits expense in the current period included severance and related charges of   $1.5 million   in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Excluding the severance and related charges, employee benefits expense decreased   1%   compared to the prior-year period, primarily reflecting a decrease in pension expense, partially offset by higher medical expense. 
  Outside services expense equaled   $466.5 million  , up from   $440.6 million   in the prior-year period. Expense for outside services in the current period included severance and related charges of   $0.7 million   in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Excluding the severance and related charges, expense for outside services increased   $25.2 million  , or   6%  , compared to the prior-year period, primarily reflecting increased technical services and consulting services, partially offset by a reduction in third party advisory fees. 
  Equipment and software expense totaled   $346.7 million  , up   $8.4 million  , or   3%   from   $338.3 million   in the prior-year period, reflecting increased software amortization.

other operating expense was   $219.4 million  , up   $11.7 million   or   6%  , compared to   $207.7 million   in the prior-year period, primarily due to increases in various other expenses, including higher supplemental compensation plans expense and FDIC deposit protection expense. 
   
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  Income tax expense was   $361.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , representing an effective tax rate of   32.1%  . The provision for income taxes was   $380.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , representing an effective tax rate of   34.1%  . The provision for income tax expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   includes a   $12.3 million   benefit related to excess tax benefits recognized in the provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in capital as a result of the Corporation s early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. 
   
  CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS  
  Total assets were   $120.1 billion   and   $116.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and averaged   $116.4 billion   in the current quarter compared with   $109.9 billion   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Average balances are considered to be a better measure of balance sheet trends, as period-end balances can be impacted by deposit and withdrawal activity involving large client balances. Loans and leases totaled   $33.4 billion   and   $33.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and averaged   $33.9 billion   in the current quarter, up   2%   from   $33.1 billion   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Securities, inclusive of Federal Reserve stock, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, and certain community development investments, which are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled   $45.0 billion   and   $38.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and averaged   $43.3 billion   for the current quarter, up   14%   from   $38.0 billion   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . In aggregate, the categories of federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks, and Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits totaled   $33.3 billion   and   $35.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and averaged   $30.7 billion   in the current quarter, down   4%   from the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily reflecting decreased interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks. Interest-bearing client deposits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , totaled   $70.3 billion   and   $66.7 billion  , respectively, and averaged   $67.9 billion   in the current quarter compared to   $66.8 billion   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . Noninterest-bearing client deposits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   totaled   $29.2 billion   and   $30.2 billion  , respectively, and averaged   $25.8 billion   in the current quarter, up   6%   from   $24.3 billion   in the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Total stockholders  equity at   September 30, 2016  , was   $9.6 billion   compared to   $8.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , and averaged   $9.2 billion   for the current quarter, up   6%   from   $8.7 billion   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in average stockholders  equity compared to the prior-year quarter was primarily attributable to the issuance of Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series D preferred stock) and earnings, partially offset by dividend declarations and the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation s share repurchase program.  
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation declared cash dividends totaling   $87.8 million   and   $255.1 million   to common stockholders, and cash dividends totaling   $5.9 million   and   $17.6 million   to Series C preferred stockholders, respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation repurchased   951,401   shares of common stock, including   42,012   shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at a total cost of   $64.9 million   (  $68.26   average price per share) and   5,231,246   shares of common stock, including   429,855   shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at a total cost of   $346.1 million   (  $66.15   average price per share), respectively.

  STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS 
  Net cash provided by operating activities of   $671.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily attributable to period earnings, partially offset by net collateral deposited with counterparties. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , net cash provided by operating activities of    $483.8 million  , was primarily attributable to period earnings, partially offset by other operating activities and net collateral deposited with counterparties. 
  Net cash used in investing activities of   $5.3 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily attributable to net purchases of securities available for sale and held to maturity, partially offset by a reduction in interest bearing deposits with banks and federal reserve and other central bank deposits. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , net cash used in investing activities of   $10.5 billion  , was primarily attributable to net purchases of securities available for sale and held to maturity, as well as increased interest bearing deposits with banks, loans and leases, and client security settlement receivables. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities of   $2.8 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily attributable to higher levels of total deposits and the issuance of the Series D preferred stock, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation s share repurchase program and cash dividends paid to common stockholders. The increase in total deposits was attributable to higher levels of demand and other noninterest-bearing client deposits. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , net cash provided by financing activities totaled   $11.6 billion  , primarily reflecting increased levels of total deposits and increased short-term other borrowings, partially offset by lower securities sold under agreements to repurchase and the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation s share repurchase program. The increase in total deposits was attributable to higher levels of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing non-U.S. office client and demand and other noninterest-bearing client deposits.

  ASSET QUALITY 

Securities Portfolio 
  Northern Trust maintains a high quality securities portfolio, with   81%   of the combined available for sale, held to maturity, and trading account portfolios at   September 30, 2016  , comprised of U.S. Treasury and government sponsored agency securities and triple-A rated corporate notes, asset-backed securities, covered bonds, sub-sovereign, supranational, sovereign and non-U.S. agency bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions. The remaining portfolio was comprised of corporate notes, asset-backed securities, negotiable certificates of deposit, obligations of states and political subdivisions, auction rate securities and other securities, of which as a percentage of the total securities portfolio,   9%   was rated double-A,   3%   was rated below double-A, and   7%   was not rated by Standard and Poor s or Moody s Investors Service (primarily negotiable certificates of deposits of banks and non-U.S. sovereign securities whose long term ratings are at least A). 
  Net unrealized gains within the investment securities portfolio totaled   $118.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  , comprised of   $193.0 million   and   $74.1 million   of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. Of the unrealized losses on securities at   September 30, 2016  , the largest component was   $30.5 million   of unrealized losses in securities classified as  other,  related to securities primarily purchased at a premium or par by Northern Trust for compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Unrealized losses on these CRA-related securities were attributable to yields that were below market rates for the purpose of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low- to moderate- income communities within Northern Trust s market area. Unrealized losses of   $22.9 million   related to government sponsored agency securities were primarily attributable to changes in market rates since their purchase. Also,   $12.9 million   of the unrealized losses related to corporate debt securities, primarily reflecting higher market rates, and wider credit spreads since purchase; as of   September 30, 2016  ,   31%   of the corporate debt portfolio was backed by guarantees provided by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities.  
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , charges of   $2.4 million   were recorded relating to the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) of certain CRA eligible securities.  There were no OTTI losses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Northern Trust has evaluated all securities with unrealized losses for possible OTTI in accordance with GAAP and Northern Trust s security impairment review policy. 
  Northern Trust participates in the repurchase agreement market as a relatively low cost alternative for short-term funding. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until their repurchase.

Nonperforming Loans and Leases and Other Real Estate Owned 
  Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and leases and other real estate owned (OREO). OREO is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. 
  The following table provides the amounts of nonperforming loans and leases, by loan and lease segment and class, and of OREO that were outstanding at the dates shown, as well as the balance of loans that was delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest. The balance of loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiations and renewals. 
  Table 23: Nonperforming Assets    

Nonperforming assets of   $181.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , reflected improved credit quality across the portfolio from the prior year. The current period included the addition of a $24.9 million non-performing loan to the  commercial and institutional loan portfolio. Furthermore, the   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , loan portfolios reflected a reclassification of a non-performing loan from the residential relate estate loan class to the commercial and institutional loan class due to a change in the obligor as a result of restructuring the loan as of   December 31, 2015  .  In addition to the negative impact on net interest income and the risk of credit losses, nonperforming assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts. Changes in the level of nonperforming assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes. Changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the specific allowance and of the qualitative factors used in the determination of the inherent allowance levels within the allowance for credit losses. 
  Northern Trust s underwriting standards do not allow for the origination of loan types generally considered to be high risk in nature, such as option adjustable rate mortgages, subprime loans, loans with initial  teaser  rates and loans with excessively high loan-to-value ratios. Residential real estate loans consist of first lien mortgages and equity credit lines, which generally require loan-to-collateral values of no more than   65%   to   75%   at inception. Revaluations of supporting collateral are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. Collateral revaluations for mortgages are performed by independent third parties. 
  The commercial real estate class consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended to experienced investors well known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. Recourse to borrowers through guarantees is also commonly required. 
   
  Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses 
  The provision for credit losses is the charge to current-period earnings that is determined by management, through a disciplined credit review process, to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable

  Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses (continued) 

credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships (specific loss component) and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios, undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit (inherent loss component). Control processes and analyses employed to evaluate the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as necessary. 
  The amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows, collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay. The inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified credit-related losses.  The inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit.  To estimate the allowance for credit losses on these instruments, management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans. 
  The provision for credit losses was a credit of   $3.0 million   in the current quarter, compared to a credit provision of   $10.0 million   in the prior-year quarter.  Net recoveries were   $0.8 million  , resulting from   $3.0 million   of charge-offs and   $3.8 million   of recoveries, compared to   $9.4 million   of net charge-offs in the prior-year quarter, resulting from   $11.9 million   of charge-offs and   $2.5 million   of recoveries. Residential real estate loans accounted for   57%   and   77%   of total nonperforming loans and leases at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements includes a table that details the changes in the allowance for credit losses during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   due to charge-offs, recoveries and provisions for credit losses.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 

Northern Trust faces two primary types of market risk through its business operations: interest rate risk, which is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in earnings and the economic value of equity; and trading risk, which is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions. 
  Northern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: sensitivity of earnings (SOE) and sensitivity of economic value of equity (SEVE). SOE provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings. SEVE provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on the economic value of equity as of the period-end balance sheet. Both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances. These two techniques, which are performed monthly, are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability. 
  As part of its risk management activities, Northern Trust also regularly measures the risk of loss associated with foreign currency positions using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) model. The following information about Northern Trust s management of market risk should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Sensitivity of Earnings     The modeling of SOE incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market-implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e. change) in earnings if future rates are 100 or 200 basis points higher than base case forward rates. The following table shows the estimated impact on the next twelve months of pre-tax earnings of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates. Given the low level of interest rates, the simulation of earnings for rates 100 and 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results.

The simulations of earnings incorporate several assumptions but do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate negative consequences of actual interest rate movements. For that reason and others, they do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk. SOE is not directly comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided. 
  Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity     Economic value of equity is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. The potential effect of interest rate changes on economic equity is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. Northern Trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e. change) if current rates are immediately increased by 100 or 200 basis points. The following table shows the estimated impact on economic value of equity of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements from current interest rates. Given the low level of interest rates and assumed interest rate floors as rates approach zero, the simulation of the economic value of equity for rates 100 or 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) 

The simulations of economic value of equity incorporate several assumptions but do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate negative consequences of actual interest rate movements. For that reason and others, they do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk. SEVE is not directly comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided. 
  Foreign Currency Value-At-Risk (VaR)     Northern Trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S. currency positions using a VaR model and applying the historical simulation methodology. This statistical model provides estimates, based on a variety of high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in non-U.S. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. The model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies. VaR is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio. 
  Northern Trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange VaR measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. Variations include different methodologies (historical, variance-covariance and Monte Carlo), equally-weighted and exponentially-weighted volatilities, horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels ranging from 95% to 99.95% and look-back periods of one year and four years. The table below presents the levels of total regulatory VaR and its subcomponents for global foreign currency as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally-weighted volatility. The total VaR for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents.

  RECONCILIATION OF CERTAIN REPORTED ITEMS TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENTS 

The tables below present reconciliations of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

Based on the increase in trade clearing activity taking place outside of the United States, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Northern Trust became a participant in the Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) in the United Kingdom.  In addition, Northern Trust anticipates becoming a participant in the European solution for securities settlements, the Target 2 Securities (T2S) platform, in 2017.  As a part of the implementation of these programs, management assessed the nature of Northern Trust s deposits with non-U.S. central banks and determined that they were similar to the deposits Northern Trust has with the Federal Reserve.  As such, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the presentation of non-U.S. central bank deposits was combined with the presentation of Federal Reserve deposits on a single financial statement line, Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits, on the face of the consolidated balance sheets. Northern Trust determined that this change in presentation was material to the financial statements and has revised the prior period presentation of the consolidated balance sheets, statements of cash flows and applicable notes to the financial statements.  This change in presentation has no impact on the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income or changes in stockholders  equity. 
    
  The table below shows the effect of the change in presentation on the Corporation s consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows for the periods presented.

2.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements     In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU No. 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.   
  The Corporation early adopted ASU No. 2016-09 on July 1, 2016 with an effective date of January 1, 2016, which resulted in a reclassification of   $5.9 million   from additional paid-in capital to provision for income taxes, representing excess tax benefits previously recognized in additional paid-in capital during the six months ended June 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recognized a benefit of   $6.4 million   in provision for income taxes for excess tax benefits that occurred in the current quarter. The early adoption favorably impacted basic and diluted EPS by   $0.03   and   $0.06   per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
  Adoption of the standard impacted the Corporation s previously reported quarterly results as follows: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation reclassified excess tax benefits from other financing activities to other operating activities and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Corporation classified taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, respectively. 
  The Corporation had no previously unrecognized excess tax benefits; therefore, there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements as it related to the elimination of the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before recognition.  
  The Corporation elected to retain its existing accounting policy election regarding award forfeitures. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 is a converged standard between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers across transactions  
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

and industries. The primary objective of ASU 2014-09 is revenue recognition that represents the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Northern Trust is currently assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2014-09. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  (ASU 2016-01). ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income unless a policy election is made for investments without readily determinable fair values.  Additionally, ASU 2016-01 requires public entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for measurement purposes and eliminates the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. Furthermore, it requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Although Northern Trust is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-01, it is not expected to impact significantly Northern Trust s consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet, with certain specified scope exceptions. Specifically within the lessee model under ASU 2016-02, a lessee is required to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments, known as the lease liability, and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted. Northern Trust is currently assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-02. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 significantly changes the way impairment of financial instruments is recognized by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial instruments. The main provisions of ASU 2016-13 include (1) replacing the  incurred loss  approach under current GAAP with an  expected loss  model for instruments measured at amortized cost, (2) requiring entities to record an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount of the investments, as is required by the other-than-temporary-impairment model under current GAAP, and (3) a simplified accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. Northern Trust is currently assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-13. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  (ASU 2016-15). ASU 2016-15 provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues, thereby reducing current and potential future diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. Northern Trust is currently assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-15. 
   
  3.     Fair Value Measurements   Fair Value Hierarchy.   The following describes the hierarchy of valuation inputs (Levels 1, 2, and 3) used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies used by Northern Trust for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity; unobservable inputs reflect the entity s own assumptions about how market participants would value an asset or liability based on the best information available. GAAP requires an entity measuring fair value to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and establishes a fair value hierarchy of inputs. Financial instruments are categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to their valuation. Northern Trust s policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value levels as of the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred. No transfers between fair value levels occurred during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Level 1     Quoted, active market prices for identical assets or liabilities. 
  Northern Trust s Level 1 assets are comprised of available for sale investments in U.S. treasury securities. 
  Level 2         Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. 
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

Northern Trust s Level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. Prices received from vendors are compared to other vendor and third-party prices. If a security price obtained from a pricing vendor is determined to exceed pre-determined tolerance levels that are assigned based on an asset type s characteristics, the exception is researched and, if the price is not able to be validated, an alternate pricing vendor is utilized, consistent with Northern Trust s pricing source hierarchy. As of   September 30, 2016  , Northern Trust s available for sale securities portfolio included   1,360   Level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of   $28.3 billion  . All   1,360   securities were valued by external pricing vendors. As of   December 31, 2015  , Northern Trust s available for sale securities portfolio included   1,044   Level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of   $26.1 billion  . All   1,044   securities were valued by external pricing vendors. Trading account securities, which totaled   $0.8 million   and   $1.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were all valued using external pricing vendors. 
  Level 2 assets and liabilities also include derivative contracts which are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect the contractual terms of the contracts. Observable inputs include foreign exchange rates and interest rates for foreign exchange contracts; interest rates for interest rate swap contracts and forward contracts; and interest rates and volatility inputs for interest rate option contracts. Northern Trust evaluates the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of its derivative instruments. Factors considered include the likelihood of default by Northern Trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting arrangements or similar agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. The resulting valuation adjustments have not been considered material. 
  Level 3         Valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace. 
  Northern Trust s Level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased in 2008 from Northern Trust clients. To estimate the fair value of auction rate securities, for which trading is limited and market prices are generally unavailable, Northern Trust developed and maintains a pricing model that discounts estimated cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. Significant inputs to the model include the contractual terms of the securities, credit risk ratings, discount rates, forward interest rates, credit/liquidity spreads, and Northern Trust s own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are Northern Trust s own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities and the applicable discount rates. Significant increases (decreases) in the estimated remaining lives or the discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
  Northern Trust s Level 3 liabilities consist of swaps that Northern Trust entered into with the purchaser of   1.1 million   and   1.0 million   shares of Visa Inc. Class B common stock (Visa Class B common shares) previously held by Northern Trust and sold in June 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pursuant to the swaps, Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Inc. Class A common stock (Visa Class A common shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and Northern Trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The swaps also require periodic payments from Northern Trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common shares and a fixed rate of interest. The fair value of the swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are Northern Trust s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the Visa Class A common share price. See  Visa Class B Common Shares  under Note 19   Contingent Liabilities for further information. 
  Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate; however, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets and liabilities, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.

     During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   transfers into or out of Level 3 assets or liabilities. 
  Carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis may be adjusted to fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition, for example, to record an impairment of an asset. GAAP requires entities to disclose separately these subsequent fair value measurements and to classify them under the fair value hierarchy. 
  Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , all of which were categorized as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy, were comprised of impaired loans whose values were based on real estate and other available collateral, and of other real estate owned (OREO) properties. Fair values of real-estate loan collateral were estimated using a market approach typically supported by third-party valuations and property-specific fees and taxes, and were subject to adjustments to reflect management s judgment as to realizable value. Other loan collateral, which typically consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, is valued using a market approach adjusted for asset-specific characteristics and in limited instances third-party valuations are used. OREO assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell, with fair value typically based on third-party appraisals. 
  Collateral-based impaired loans and OREO assets that have been adjusted to fair value totaled   $6.7 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively, at   September 30, 2016  , and   $10.9 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, at   September 30, 2015  . Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis reflect management s judgment as to realizable value. 
  The following table provides the fair value of, and the valuation technique, significant unobservable inputs and quantitative information used to develop the significant unobservable inputs for, Northern Trust s Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.   GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value. It excludes from this requirement nonfinancial assets and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, relationship and intangible values that add value to Northern Trust. Accordingly,  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

the required fair value disclosures provide only a partial estimate of the fair value of Northern Trust. Financial instruments recorded at fair value in Northern Trust s consolidated balance sheets are discussed above. The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value. 
  Held to Maturity Securities.   The fair values of held to maturity securities, excluding U.S. treasury securities, were obtained from external pricing vendors, or in limited cases internally, using widely accepted models which are based on an income approach (discounted cash flow) that incorporates current market yield curves. The fair values of U.S. treasury securities were determined using quoted, active market prices for identical securities. 
  Loans (excluding lease receivables).   The fair value of the loan portfolio was estimated using an income approach (discounted cash flow) that incorporates current market rates offered by Northern Trust as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. The fair values of all loans were adjusted to reflect current assessments of loan collectability. Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. 
  Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock.   The fair values of Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock are equal to their carrying values which represent redemption value. 
  Community Development Investments.   The fair values of these instruments were estimated using an income approach (discounted cash flow) that incorporates current market rates. 
  Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation.   These assets include U.S. Treasury securities and investments in mutual and collective trust funds held to fund certain supplemental employee benefit obligations and deferred compensation plans. Fair values of U.S. Treasury securities were determined using quoted, active market prices for identical securities. The fair values of investments in mutual and collective trust funds were valued at the funds  net asset values based on a market approach. 
  Savings Certificates and Other Time Deposits.   The fair values of these instruments were estimated using an income approach (discounted cash flow) that incorporates market interest rates currently offered by Northern Trust for deposits with similar maturities. 
  Senior Notes, Subordinated Debt, and Floating Rate Capital Debt.   Fair values were determined using a market approach based on quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices were not available, fair values were based on quoted market prices for comparable instruments. 
  Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings.   The fair values of these instruments were estimated using an income approach (discounted cash flow) that incorporates market interest rates available to Northern Trust. 
  Loan Commitments.   The fair values of loan commitments represent the estimated costs to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations with a third party adjusted for any related allowance for credit losses. 
  Standby Letters of Credit.   The fair values of standby letters of credit are measured as the amount of unamortized fees on these instruments, inclusive of the related allowance for credit losses. Fees are determined by applying basis points to the principal amounts of the letters of credit. 
  Financial Instruments Valued at Carrying Value.   Due to their short maturity, the carrying values of certain financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include: cash and due from banks; federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell; interest-bearing deposits with banks; Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits; client security settlement receivables; non-U.S. offices interest-bearing deposits; federal funds purchased; securities sold under agreements to repurchase; and other borrowings (includes term federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings). The fair values of demand, noninterest-bearing, savings, and money market deposits represent the amounts payable on demand as of the reporting date, although such deposits are typically priced at a premium in banking industry consolidations.

Gross proceeds from the sale of securities during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $217.2 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively. 
  There were   $1.9 million   of net investment security losses recognized in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which include   $2.4 million   of charges related to the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) of certain Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) eligible held to maturity securities.  Net investment security losses of   $0.3 million   were recognized in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , proceeds of   $740.8 million   were received from the sale of securities, resulting in gross realized gains of   $0.5 million  .  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , proceeds of   $110.3 million   were received from the sale of securities, resulting in gross realized gains and losses of   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively.

Securities with Unrealized Losses.   The following tables provide information regarding securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and for twelve months or longer as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Table 39: Securities with Unrealized Losses    

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   762   securities with a combined fair value of   $13.8 billion   were in an unrealized loss position, with their unrealized losses totaling   $74.1 million  .  Unrealized losses of   $22.9 million   related to government sponsored agency securities were primarily attributable to higher market interest rates since purchase.  Unrealized losses of   $12.9 million   within corporate debt securities primarily reflected higher market rates and wider credit spreads since purchase;   31%   of the corporate debt portfolio is backed by guarantees provided by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities.  
  The majority of the   $30.5 million   of unrealized losses in securities classified as  other  at   September 30, 2016  , related to securities primarily purchased at a premium or par by Northern Trust for compliance with the CRA. Unrealized losses on these CRA-related securities were attributable to yields that were below market rates for the purpose of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low- to moderate- income communities within Northern Trust s market area. Unrealized losses of   $0.3 million   related to  
  
   50 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

auction rate securities primarily reflected reduced market liquidity as a majority of auctions continued to fail, preventing holders from liquidating their investments at par. The remaining unrealized losses on Northern Trust s securities portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  , were attributable to changes in overall market interest rates, increased credit spreads or reduced market liquidity. As of   September 30, 2016  , Northern Trust did not intend to sell any investment in an unrealized loss position and it was not more likely than not that Northern Trust would be required to sell any such investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. 
  Security impairment reviews are conducted quarterly to identify and evaluate securities that have indications of possible OTTI. A determination as to whether a security s decline in market value is other-than-temporary takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security. Factors Northern Trust considers in determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary include, but are not limited to: the length of time the security has been impaired; the severity of the impairment; the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; activity in the market of the issuer, which may indicate adverse credit conditions; Northern Trust s intent regarding the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date; and the likelihood that it will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security s amortized cost basis. For each security meeting the requirements of Northern Trust s internal screening process, an extensive review is conducted to determine if OTTI has occurred. 
  While all securities are considered, the process for identifying credit impairment within CRA-eligible mortgage-backed securities incorporates an expected loss approach using discounted cash flows on the underlying collateral pools. To evaluate whether an unrealized loss on CRA-eligible mortgage-backed securities is other-than-temporary, a calculation of the security s present value is made using current pool data, the current delinquency pipeline, default rates and loan loss severities based on the historical performance of the mortgage pools, and Northern Trust s outlook for the housing market and the overall economy. If the present value of the collateral pools was found to be less than the current amortized cost of the security, a credit-related OTTI loss would be recorded in earnings equal to the difference between the two amounts. 
  Impairments of CRA-eligible mortgage-backed securities are influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, U.S. economic and housing market performance, pool credit enhancement level, year of origination and estimated credit quality of the collateral. The factors used in estimating losses related to CRA-eligible mortgage-backed securities vary by vintage of loan origination and collateral quality. There were   no   OTTI losses recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016. There were   $2.4 million   of OTTI losses recognized in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   related to CRA-eligible mortgage-backed securities.  There were   no   OTTI losses recognized during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Credit Losses on Debt Securities.   The table below provides the cumulative credit-related losses recognized in earnings on debt securities other-than-temporarily impaired.

5. Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase     Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until the repurchase.

6. Loans and Leases     Amounts outstanding for loans and leases, by segment and class, are shown below. 
  Table 42: Loans and Leases    

Residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines that generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than   65%   to   75%   at inception. Northern Trust s equity credit line products generally have draw periods of up to   10   years and a balloon payment of any outstanding balance is due at maturity.  Payments are interest only with variable interest rates. Northern Trust does not offer equity credit lines that include an option to convert the outstanding balance to an amortizing payment loan. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , equity credit lines totaled   $1.3 billion   and   $1.5 billion  , respectively, and equity credit lines for which first liens were held by Northern Trust represented   90%   and   89%   of the total equity credit lines as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Included within the non-U.S., commercial-other and personal-other classes are short-duration advances primarily related to the processing of custodied client investments that totaled   $1.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $719.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Demand deposits reclassified as loan balances totaled   $31.6 million   and   $75.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Loans and leases classified as held for sale totaled   $1.2 million   and   $53.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and totaled   $12.0 million   and   $112.3 million  , at   December 31, 2015  , respectively, primarily related to the decision to exit a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio.  
  Credit Quality Indicators.   Credit quality indicators are statistics, measurements or other metrics that provide information regarding the relative credit risk of loans and leases. Northern Trust utilizes a variety of credit quality indicators to assess the credit risk of loans and leases at the segment, class and individual credit exposure levels. 
  
   52 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

As part of its credit process, Northern Trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification, approval and monitoring of credit risk. Borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting, management reporting and the calculation of credit loss allowances and economic capital. 
  Risk ratings are used for ranking the credit risk of borrowers and the probability of their default. Each borrower is rated using one of a number of ratings models or other subjective assessment methodologies, which consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. The ratings models vary among classes of loans and leases in order to capture the unique risk characteristics inherent within each particular type of credit exposure. Provided below are the more significant performance indicator attributes considered within Northern Trust s borrower rating models, by loan and lease class. 
             
    Commercial and Institutional: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels; 
                
    Commercial Real Estate: debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratio, leasing status and guarantor support; 
                
    Lease Financing and Commercial-Other: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels; 
                
    Non-U.S.: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, return on assets and capital levels; 
                
    Residential Real Estate: payment history, credit bureau scores and loan-to-value ratio; 
                
    Private Client: cash-flow-to-debt and net worth ratios, leverage and liquidity; and 
                
    Personal-Other: cash-flow-to-debt and net worth ratios. 
     While the criteria vary by model, the objective is for the borrower ratings to be consistent in both the measurement and ranking of risk. Each model is calibrated to a master rating scale to support this consistency. Ratings for borrowers not in default range from  1  for the strongest credits to  7  for the weakest non-defaulted credits. Ratings of  8  or  9  are used for defaulted borrowers. Borrower risk ratings are monitored and are revised when events or circumstances indicate a change is required. Risk ratings are validated at least annually. 
  Loan and lease segment and class balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are provided below, segregated by borrower ratings into  1 to 3,   4 to 5  and  6 to 9  (watch list), categories. 
  Table 43: Borrower Ratings    

Loans and leases in the  1 to 3  category are expected to exhibit minimal to modest probabilities of default and are characterized by borrowers having the strongest financial qualities, including above average financial flexibility, cash flows and capital levels. Borrowers assigned these ratings are anticipated to experience very little to moderate financial pressure in adverse down cycle scenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers within this category exhibit a minimal to modest likelihood of loss. 
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

Loans and leases in the  4 to 5  category are expected to exhibit moderate to acceptable probabilities of default and are characterized by borrowers with less financial flexibility than those in the  1 to 3  category. Cash flows and capital levels are generally sufficient to allow for borrowers to meet current requirements, but have reduced cushion in adverse down cycle scenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers within this category exhibit a moderate likelihood of loss. 
  Loans and leases in the watch list category have elevated credit risk profiles that are monitored through internal watch lists, and consist of credits with borrower ratings of  6 to 9.  These credits, which include all nonperforming credits, are expected to exhibit minimally acceptable probabilities of default, elevated risk of default, or are currently in default. Borrowers associated with these risk profiles that are not currently in default have limited financial flexibility. Cash flows and capital levels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements, particularly in adverse down cycle scenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers in this category exhibit an elevated likelihood of loss. 
  Recognition of Income.   Interest income on loans is recorded on an accrual basis unless, in the opinion of management, there is a question as to the ability of the debtor to meet the terms of the loan agreement, or interest or principal is more than   90   days contractually past due and the loan is not well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans meeting such criteria are classified as nonperforming and interest income is recorded on a cash basis. At the time a loan is determined to be nonperforming, interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period. Interest collected on nonperforming loans is applied to principal unless, in the opinion of management, collectability of principal is not in doubt. Management s assessment of the indicators of loan and lease collectability, and its policies relative to the recognition of interest income, including the suspension and subsequent resumption of income recognition, do not meaningfully vary between loan and lease classes. Nonperforming loans are returned to performing status when factors indicating doubtful collectability no longer exist. Factors considered in returning a loan to performing status are consistent across all classes of loans and leases and, in accordance with regulatory guidance, relate primarily to expected payment performance. Loans are eligible to be returned to performing status when: (i) no principal or interest that is due is unpaid and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or (ii) the loan has otherwise become well-secured (possessing realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt, including accrued interest, in full) and is in the process of collection (through action reasonably expected to result in debt repayment or restoration to a current status in the near future). A loan that has not been brought fully current may be restored to performing status provided there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of   six   months) by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms, and Northern Trust is reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period of time. Additionally, a loan that has been formally restructured so as to be reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to its modified terms may be returned to accrual status, provided there was a well-documented credit evaluation of the borrower s financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms and there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of   six   months) under the revised terms.

Past due status is based on how long since the contractual due date a principal or interest payment has been past due. For disclosure purposes, loans that are 29 days past due or less are reported as current. The following tables provide balances and delinquency status of performing and nonperforming loans and leases by segment and class, as well as the total OREO and nonperforming asset balances, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Table 44: Delinquency Status    

Impaired Loans.   A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, management determines that it is probable that Northern Trust will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are identified through ongoing credit management and risk rating processes, including the formal review of past due and watch list credits. Payment performance and delinquency status are critical factors in identifying impairment for all loans and leases, particularly those within the residential real estate, private client and personal-other classes. Other key factors considered in identifying impairment of loans and leases within the commercial and institutional, non-U.S., lease financing and commercial-other classes relate to the borrower s ability to perform under the terms of the obligation as measured through the  
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

assessment of future cash flows, including consideration of collateral value, market value and other factors. A loan is also considered to be impaired if its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor s financial difficulties, referred to as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) and discussed in further detail below. Impairment is measured based upon the loan s market price, the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, based on the certainty of loss, either a specific allowance is established or a charge-off is recorded for the difference. Smaller balance (individually less than   $1 million  ) homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards. Northern Trust s accounting policies for impaired loans are consistent across all classes of loans and leases.

The following tables provide information related to impaired loans by segment and class.

Note: Average recorded investment in impaired loans is calculated as the average of the month-end impaired loan balances for the period. 
  Interest income that would have been recorded for nonperforming loans in accordance with their original terms was   $2.1 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $6.3 million   and   $4.1 million  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   
  
   57 

     Table of Contents

There were   $3.3 million   and   $3.1 million   of aggregate undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, issued to borrowers whose loans were classified as nonperforming or impaired. 
  Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs).   Included within impaired loans were   $81.2 million   and   $79.2 million   of nonperforming TDRs, and   $46.1 million   and   $37.9 million   of performing TDRs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the calendar year of their restructuring. In subsequent years, a TDR may cease being reported as impaired if the loan was modified at a market rate and has performed according to the modified terms for at least six months. A loan that has been modified at a below market rate will return to performing status if it satisfies the six-month performance requirement; however, it will remain reported as impaired. 
  The following tables provide, by segment and class, the number of loans and leases modified in TDRs during the   three- and nine-   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the recorded investments and unpaid principal balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Note: Period end balances reflect all paydowns and charge-offs during the period. 
  TDR modifications involve interest rate concessions, extensions of term, deferrals of principal and other modifications. Other modifications typically reflect other nonstandard terms which Northern Trust would not offer in non-troubled situations. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the majority of TDR modifications of loans within residential real estate were extension of term, other modifications, deferred principal, and interest rate concessions. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the majority of TDR modifications within commercial and institutional, and commercial real estate classes were extension of term, and other modifications. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the  
  
   58 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

majority of TDR modifications of loans within residential real estate were interest rate concessions, extension of term, or deferred principal. The majority of TDR modifications of loans within commercial and institutional, commercial real estate, and private client classes were extension of term, deferred principal, and other modifications. 
  There was   one   residential real estate loan modified in a TDR during the twelve months ended   June 30, 2016  , which subsequently became nonperforming during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The total recorded investment and unpaid principal balance for this loan was approximately   $0.1 million  .  
  There were   two   residential real estate loans modified in TDRs during the twelve months ended   June 30,     2015  , which subsequently became nonperforming during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The total recorded investment and unpaid principal balance for these loans was approximately $  0.5 million  . 
  All loans and leases modified in TDRs are evaluated for impairment. The nature and extent of impairment of TDRs, including those that have experienced a subsequent default, is considered in the determination of an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses. 
  Northern Trust may obtain physical possession of residential real estate collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan via foreclosure on an in-substance repossession. As of   September 30, 2016  , Northern Trust held foreclosed residential real estate properties with a carrying value of   $7.2 million   as a result of obtaining physical possession. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , Northern Trust had consumer loans with a carrying value of   $19.5 million   collateralized by residential real estate property for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process. 
  Leveraged Leases.    During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   September 30, 2015  , Northern Trust determined that there was an other-than-temporary impairment of the residual value related to certain aircraft and rail car under leveraged lease agreements.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the impact of the impairment was   $10.2 million   which was recognized as a reduction to other operating income and interest income in the consolidated statements of income. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the impact of the impairment was   $17.8 million  , which was recognized as a reduction to interest income in the consolidated statements of income.  See  Leveraged Leases  under Note 18 - Variable interest Entities for further information. 
   
  7. Allowance for Credit Losses     The allowance for credit losses, which represents management s estimate of probable losses related to specific borrower relationships and inherent in the various loan and lease portfolios, undrawn commitments, and standby letters of credit, is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust s accounting policies related to the estimation of the allowance for credit losses and the charging off of loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are consistent across both loan and lease segments. 
  As of December 31, 2015, Northern Trust changed the estimation methodology for inherent losses that have been incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. The new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused than the previous methodology as it is based on internally developed loss data specific to the Northern Trust loan and lease portfolio. The change in methodology is accounted for as a change in estimate applicable to the current period and future periods. The new estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into homogeneous segments. For each segment, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance. The estimated allowance is reviewed by the Loan Loss Reserve Committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio. In determining the appropriate adjustment, management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology. The Loan Loss Reserve Committee is comprised of representatives from Credit Risk Management, the reporting segments and Corporate Finance.  The new methodology was used to determine the inherent allowance as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  For periods prior to the methodology change, including as of   September 30, 2015  , the amount of inherent allowance was based on factors that incorporated management s evaluation of historical charge-off experience and various qualitative factors such as management s evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio. Factors were applied to loan and lease credit exposures aggregated by shared risk characteristics and were reviewed quarterly by the Loan Loss Reserve Committee. 
  Loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Determinations as to whether an uncollectible loan is charged-off or a specific allowance is established are based on management s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss.

to   $35.8 billion   (  $27.1 billion   of government-sponsored agency and other securities,   $117.5 million   of obligations of states and political subdivisions and   $8.6 billion   of loans) at   December 31, 2015  . Collateral required for these purposes totaled   $7.9 billion   and   $8.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Available for sale securities with a total fair value of   $1.2 billion   and   $1.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were included in the total pledged assets, which were pledged as collateral for agreements to repurchase securities sold transactions. The secured parties to these transactions have the right to repledge or sell these securities. 
  Northern Trust is not permitted, by contract or custom, to repledge or sell collateral from agreements to resell securities purchased transactions. The total fair value of accepted collateral was   $1.6 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $1.5 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  . There was   no   repledged or sold collateral at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Deposits maintained to meet Federal Reserve Bank reserve requirements averaged   $2.3 billion   and   $2.0 billion   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   $1.7 billion   and   $1.6 billion   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

  Table 50: Other Intangible Assets    

Other intangible assets consist primarily of the value of acquired client relationships and are included within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense related to other intangible assets totaled   $2.0 million   and   $6.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $2.1 million   and   $8.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Amortization for the remainder of   2016   and for the years   2017  ,   2018  ,   2019  , and   2020   is estimated to be   $2.6 million  ,   $9.0 million  ,   $8.3 million  ,   $8.2 million   and   $8.2 million  , respectively. 
  In May 2016, Northern Trust completed its acquisition of Aviate Global LLP, an institutional equity brokerage firm offering market research and execution services with offices located in the United States, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The purchase price, which is subject to certain performance-related adjustments over a   three  -year period after the acquisition date, totaled   $18.8 million   inclusive of contingent consideration. Goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisition totaled   $11.8 million   and   $4.5 million  , respectively.

  On   August 8, 2016  , the Corporation issued and sold   500,000   depositary shares (the  Depositary Shares ), each representing a   1/100th   ownership interest in a share of Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the  Series D Preferred Stock ).  Shares of the Series D Preferred Stock have no par value and a liquidation preference of   $100,000   (equivalent to   $1,000   per depositary share).  The aggregate proceeds from the public offering of the depositary shares, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were   $493.5 million  . 
  Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock, which are not mandatory, will accrue and be payable on the liquidation preference amount, on a non-cumulative basis, at a rate per annum equal to (i)   4.60%   from the original issue date of the Series D Preferred Stock to but excluding   October 1, 2026  ; and (ii) a floating rate equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus   3.202%   from and including   October 1, 2026  . Fixed rate dividends will be payable in arrears on the 1st day of April and October of each year, commencing on   April 1, 2017  , to and including   October 1, 2026  , and floating rate dividends will be payable in arrears on the 1st day of January, April, July and October of each year, commencing on   January 1, 2027  .  
  The Series D Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the Corporation s option in whole, or in part, on any dividend payment date on or after   October 1, 2026   at a redemption price equal to   $100,000   per share (equivalent to   $1,000   per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The Series D Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the Corporation s option in whole, but not in part, including prior to   October 1, 2026  , upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event as described in the Series D Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation also had issued and outstanding   16 million   depositary shares, each representing   1/1000th   ownership interest in a share of Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock ( Series C Preferred Stock ), issued in August 2014.  Equity related to Series C Preferred Stock as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   totaled   $388.5 million  . Series C Preferred Stock has   no   par value and has a liquidation preference of   $25,000   (  $25   per depositary share). 
  Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will accrue and be payable on the liquidation preference amount, on a non-cumulative basis, quarterly in arrears on the first day of January, April, July and October of each year, at a rate per annum equal to   5.85%  . On   July 20, 2016  , the Corporation declared a cash dividend of   $365.625   per share of Series C Preferred Stock payable on   October 1, 2016  , to stockholders of record as of   September 15, 2016  . 
  Common Stock.   During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation repurchased   951,401   shares of common stock, including   42,012   shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at a total cost of   $64.9 million   (  $68.26   average price per share) and   5,231,246   shares of common stock, including   429,855   shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at a total cost of   $346.1 million   (  $66.15   average price per share), respectively.

13. Net Income Per Common Share Computations     The computations of net income per common share are presented in the following table. 
  Table 55: Net Income per Common Share    

Note: Common stock equivalents of   334,184   and   1,480,118     for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted net income per common share because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , there were   no   common stock equivalents excluded in the computation of diluted net income per common share. Common stock equivalents of   496,104   for the nine months   September 30, 2015  ,   were not included in the computation of diluted net income per common share because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

17. Share-Based Compensation Plans     The Northern Trust Corporation 2012 Stock Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units. 
  Total compensation expense for share-based payment arrangements and the associated tax impacts were as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Table 58: Total Compensation Expense for Share-Based Payment Arrangements    

18. Variable Interest Entities     Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) are defined within GAAP as entities that either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Investors that finance a VIE through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity. The variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the VIE s primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. 
    
  On January 1, 2016, Northern Trust adopted ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  (ASU 2015-02), which modified the Corporation s evaluation of whether certain legal entities are VIEs, and if Northern Trust would be deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Upon adoption, Northern Trust was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, and therefore there was no impact to its consolidated financial position or statement of operations. 
  Leveraged Leases.   In leveraged leasing transactions, Northern Trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds   20   -   30%   of the asset s cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining   70   -   80%   provided by third-party non-recourse debt holders. In such transactions, the trusts, which are VIEs, are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership. The lessee s maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property, and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property. As a result, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. 
  Northern Trust s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the leveraged lease trust VIEs is limited to the carrying amounts of its leveraged lease investments. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in loans and leases in the consolidated balance sheets, were   $193.5 million   and   $389.4 million  , respectively. Northern Trust s funding requirements relative to the VIEs are limited to its invested capital. Northern Trust has   no   other liquidity arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the VIEs that would expose Northern Trust to a loss. 
  Tax Credit Structures.   Northern Trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities (collectively, community development projects) that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. The community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and LLCs in which Northern Trust invests as a limited partner/investor member through equity contributions. The economic performance of the community development projects, which are VIEs, is subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development projects as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the VIEs.

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

Northern Trust s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with community development projects is limited to the carrying amount of its investments, including any undrawn commitments. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of investments in community development projects that generate tax credits, included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled   $165.1 million   and   $173.5 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , liabilities related to undrawn commitments on investments in tax credit community development projects, included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled   $32.2 million   and   $10.5 million  , respectively. Northern Trust s funding requirements are limited to its invested capital and undrawn commitments for future equity contributions. Northern Trust has   no   exposure to loss from liquidity arrangements and no obligation to purchase assets of the community development projects. 
  Affordable housing tax credits and other tax benefits attributable to community development projects totaled   $12.5 million   and   $13.1 million  , respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $36.5 million   and   $39.6 million  , respectively,  for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   
  Investment Funds.   Northern Trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of Northern Trust are investors. As an asset manager of funds, Northern Trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund s investment objective.  Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP.  
    
  Some of the funds (Funds) for which Northern Trust acts as asset manager comply or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds and therefore the Funds are exempt from the consolidation requirements in ASU 2015-02. Northern Trust voluntarily waived   $0.2 million   and   $8.1 million   of money market mutual fund fees for the three months and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Northern Trust does not have any explicit arrangements to provide financial support to the Funds. Any potential future support of the Funds will be at the discretion of Northern Trust after an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances. 
  Periodically, Northern Trust makes seed capital investments to certain funds. As of   September 30, 2016   Northern Trust had   no   seed capital investments and   no   unfunded commitments related to seed capital investments. As of   December 31, 2015  , Northern Trust had a   $25.3 million   investment, valued using net asset value per share and included in other assets, and a   $25.0 million   unfunded commitment related to seed capital investments. 

19. Contingent Liabilities 
  Commitments, Letters of Credit and Indemnifications.   Northern Trust, in the normal course of business, enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients. 
  Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements. Legally binding commitments to extend credit totaled   $34.7 billion   and   $37.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Standby letters of credit obligate Northern Trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. These instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges and similar transactions. Northern Trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants. Standby letters of credit outstanding were   $4.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  As part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients, Northern Trust lends securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the Northern Trust Counterparty Risk Management Committee. In connection with these activities, Northern Trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower s failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted. Borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities. As securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum of   100%   of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. The collateral is revalued on a daily basis. The amount of securities loaned as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   subject to indemnification was   $103.6 billion   and   $94.5 billion  , respectively. Because of the credit quality of the borrowers and the requirement to collateralize fully securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and   no   liability was recorded as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , related to these indemnifications.

Legal Proceedings.   In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and threatened legal actions, including, but not limited to, actions brought on behalf of various claimants or classes of claimants, regulatory matters, employment matters and challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. In certain of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages or adjustments to recorded tax liabilities are asserted. 
  Based on current knowledge, after consultation with legal counsel and after taking into account current accruals, management does not believe that losses, if any, arising from pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation, although such matters could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s operating results for a particular period. 
  Under GAAP, (i) an event is  probable  if the  future event or events are likely to occur  (ii) an event is  reasonably possible  if  the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely  and (iii) an event is  remote  if  the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.  
  For the reasons set out in this paragraph, the outcome of some matters is inherently difficult to predict and/or the range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. This may be the case in matters that (i) will be decided by a jury, (ii) are in early stages, (iii) involve uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iv) are subject to appeals or motions, (v) involve significant factual issues to be resolved, including with respect to the amount of damages, (vi) do not specify the amount of damages sought or (vii) seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability legal theories. Accordingly, the Corporation cannot reasonably estimate the eventual outcome of these pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties, if any, related to each pending matter will be. 
  In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation records accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. When loss contingencies are not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Corporation does not record accruals. No material accruals have been recorded for pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters. 
  For a limited number of the matters for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses for these matters to be approximately   $35 million   in the aggregate. This aggregate amount of reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results will vary significantly from the current estimate. 
  In certain other pending matters, there may be a range of reasonably possible losses (including reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued) that cannot be reasonably estimated for the reasons described above. Such matters are not included in the estimate of reasonably possible losses identified above. 
  A number of participants in Northern Trust s securities lending program, which is associated with its asset servicing business, commenced either individual lawsuits or purported class actions in which they claimed, among other things, that Northern Trust failed to exercise prudence in the investment management of the collateral received from the borrowers of the securities, resulting in losses associated with the 2008 financial crisis that they sought to recover. The cases asserted various contractual, statutory and common law claims, including claims for breach of fiduciary duty under common law and under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). In 2013, Northern Trust recorded a   $19.2 million   charge in connection with a settlement to resolve certain claims related to   two   of these lawsuits. In the three months ended June 30, 2016, Northern Trust recorded a   $46.5 million   charge in connection with a settlement to resolve all but one of the remaining claims.  All but $4.3 million of this settlement became final in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The remaining $4.3 million has received preliminary court approval, with a final approval hearing scheduled for January 2017.  In the three months ended September 30, 2016, Northern Trust recorded a   $3.5 million   charge in connection with the settlement of the one claim that had not been part of the previous settlement. 
  As previously disclosed in April 2014, Northern Trust remains subject to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to Northern Trust s securities lending activities. Northern Trust continues to cooperate with the SEC in this investigation. 
  In January 2015, the Public Prosecutor s Office of France recommended that certain charges be brought against Northern Trust Fiduciary Services (Guernsey) Limited (NTFS), an indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, relating to the administration of   two   trusts for which NTFS serves as trustee. In April 2015, a French investigating magistrate judge charged NTFS with complicity in  
  
   72 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

estate tax fraud. Charges also were brought against a number of other persons and entities related to this matter. As trustee, NTFS provided no tax advice and had no involvement in the preparation or filing of the challenged estate tax filings. NTFS has contested the criminal charge in the French court. The trial related to this matter concluded in October 2016, with the court s decision expected in January 2017. 
  Visa Class B Common Shares.   Northern Trust, as a member of Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.) and in connection with the 2007 restructuring of Visa U.S.A. and its affiliates and the 2008 initial public offering of Visa Inc. (Visa), received certain Visa Class B common shares. The Visa Class B common shares are subject to certain selling restrictions until the final resolution of the covered litigation noted below, at which time the shares are convertible into Visa Class A common shares based on a conversion rate dependent upon the ultimate cost of resolving the covered litigation. 
  Certain members of Visa U.S.A. are obligated to indemnify Visa for losses resulting from certain litigation relating to interchange fees (the covered litigation). On October 19, 2012, Visa signed a settlement agreement with plaintiff representatives for binding settlement of the covered litigation. On January 14, 2014, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs. A number of objectors appealed from that order and more than   30   opt-out cases have been filed by merchants in various federal district courts. On June 30, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court s approval of the settlement and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. The ultimate resolution of the covered litigation and the timing for removal of the selling restrictions on the Visa Class B common shares are uncertain. 
    
  In June 2016 and 2015, Northern Trust recorded a   $123.1 million   and   $99.9 million   net gain on the sale of   1.1 million   and   1.0 million   of its Visa Class B common shares, respectively.  Northern Trust continued to hold approximately   4.1 million   and   5.2 million   Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at their original cost basis of   zero   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
   
  20. Derivative Financial Instruments     Northern Trust is a party to various derivative financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients, as part of its trading activity for its own account and as part of its risk management activities. These instruments include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts, total return swap contracts, and credit default swap contracts. 
  Northern Trust s primary risks associated with these instruments are the possibility that interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, or credit spreads could change in an unanticipated manner, resulting in higher costs or a loss in the underlying value of the instrument. These risks are mitigated by establishing limits, monitoring the level of actual positions taken against such established limits and monitoring the level of any interest rate sensitivity gaps created by such positions. When establishing position limits, market liquidity and volatility, as well as experience in each market, are taken into account. 
  Credit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to the failure of the counterparty and the failure of Northern Trust to pay based on the contractual terms of the agreement, and is generally limited to the unrealized fair value gains and losses, respectively, on these instruments, net of any cash collateral received or deposited. The amount of credit risk will increase or decrease during the lives of the instruments as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other underlying exposures fluctuate. Northern Trust s risk is controlled by limiting such activity to an approved list of counterparties and by subjecting such activity to the same credit and quality controls as are followed in lending and investment activities. Credit Support Annexes and other similar agreements are currently in place with a number of Northern Trust s counterparties which mitigate the aforementioned credit risk associated with derivative activity conducted with those counterparties by requiring that significant net unrealized fair value gains be supported by collateral placed with Northern Trust. 
  All derivative financial instruments, whether designated as hedges or not, are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value within other assets or other liabilities. As noted in the discussions below, the manner in which changes in the fair value of a derivative is accounted for in the consolidated statements of income depends on whether the contract has been designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting under GAAP. Northern Trust has elected to net derivative assets and liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between Northern Trust and the counterparty. Derivative assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were each reduced by   $1.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as a result of master netting arrangements and similar agreements in place. Derivative assets and liabilities recorded at   September 30, 2016  , also reflect reductions of   $339.0 million   and   $768.5 million  , respectively, as a result of cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties, respectively. This compares with reductions of derivative assets and liabilities of   $322.8 million   and   $440.2 million  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . Additional cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties totaling   $34.0 million   and   $98.4 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $31.1 million   and   $27.3 million  , respectively, as of   December 31, 2015  , were not offset against derivative  
  
   73 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as the amounts exceeded the net derivative positions with those counterparties. Northern Trust centrally clears eligible interest rate derivative instruments as required under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Securities posted as collateral for these transactions totaled   $51.1 million   and   $15.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are not offset against derivative assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and the counterparty receiving the securities as collateral does not have the right to repledge or sell the securities. 
  Certain master netting arrangements Northern Trust enters into with derivative counterparties contain credit-risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust s credit rating falls below specified levels. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was   $688.1 million   and   $553.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Cash collateral amounts deposited with derivative counterparties on those dates included   $665.0 million   and   $163.0 million  , respectively, posted against these liabilities, resulting in a net maximum amount of termination payments that could have been required at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , of   $23.1 million   and   $390.2 million  , respectively. Accelerated settlement of these liabilities would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of Northern Trust. 
  Foreign exchange contracts   are agreements to exchange specific amounts of currencies at a future date, at a specified rate of exchange. Foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to meet the foreign exchange needs of clients. Foreign exchange contracts are also used for trading purposes and risk management. For risk management purposes, Northern Trust uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates relating to certain forecasted non-functional-currency-denominated revenue and expenditure transactions, foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities, including investment securities and net investments in non-U.S. affiliates. 
  Interest rate contracts   include swap and option contracts. Interest rate swap contracts involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Northern Trust enters into interest rate swap contracts with its clients and also may utilize such contracts to reduce or eliminate the exposure to changes in the cash flows or fair value of hedged assets or liabilities due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate option contracts may include caps, floors, collars and swaptions, and provide for the transfer or reduction of interest rate risk, typically in exchange for a fee. Northern Trust enters into option contracts primarily as a seller of interest rate protection to clients. Northern Trust receives a fee at the outset of the agreement for the assumption of the risk of an unfavorable change in interest rates. This assumed interest rate risk is then mitigated by entering into an offsetting position with an outside counterparty. Northern Trust may also purchase or enter into option contracts for risk management purposes including to reduce the exposure to changes in the cash flows of hedged assets due to changes in interest rates. 
  Client-Related and Trading Derivative Instruments.   Approximately   96%   of Northern Trust s derivatives outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , measured on a notional value basis, relate to client-related and trading activities. These activities consist principally of providing foreign exchange services to clients in connection with Northern Trust s global custody business. However, in the normal course of business, Northern Trust also engages in trading of currencies for its own account. 
  The following table shows the notional and fair values of client-related and trading derivative financial instruments. Notional amounts of derivative financial instruments do not represent credit risk, and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. They are used merely to express the volume of this activity. Northern Trust s credit-related risk of loss is limited to the positive fair value of the derivative instrument, which is significantly less than the notional amount.

Changes in the fair value of client-related and trading derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. The following table shows the location and amount of gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Table 60: Location and Amount of Client-Related and Trading Derivative Gains and Losses Recorded in Income    

Risk Management Instruments.   Northern Trust uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate, equity price, and credit risk. Certain hedging relationships are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Other derivatives that are entered into for risk management purposes as economic hedges are not formally designated as hedges and changes in fair value are recognized currently in other operating income. 
  In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a formal assessment is performed on a calendar-quarter basis to verify that derivatives used in designated hedging transactions continue to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If a derivative ceases to be highly effective, matures, is sold or is terminated, or if a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, hedge accounting is terminated and the derivative is treated as if it were a trading instrument. 
  The following table identifies the types and classifications of derivative instruments formally designated as hedges under GAAP and used by Northern Trust to manage risk, their notional and fair values, and the respective risks addressed. 
  Table 61: Notional and Fair Value of Designated Risk Management Derivative Financial Instruments    

75 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

Derivatives are designated as fair value hedges to limit Northern Trust s exposure to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates. For a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recorded currently in income. The following table shows the location and amount of derivative gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of income related to fair value hedges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Table 62: Location and Amount of Fair Value Hedge Derivative Gains and Losses Recorded in Income    

Northern Trust applies the  shortcut  method of accounting, available under GAAP, to substantially all of its fair value hedges, which assumes there is no ineffectiveness in a hedge. For fair value hedges that do not qualify for the  shortcut  method of accounting, Northern Trust utilizes regression analysis, the  long-haul  method of accounting, in assessing whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and quarterly thereafter. There was no ineffectiveness or changes in the fair value of hedged items recognized in income for fair value hedges accounted for under the  long-haul  method of accounting during the   three- and nine-   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Derivatives are also designated as cash flow hedges in order to minimize the variability in cash flows of earning assets or forecasted transactions caused by movements in interest or foreign exchange rates. There was no ineffectiveness recognized in income for cash flow hedges during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   23   months was the maximum length of time over which the exposure to variability in future cash flows of forecasted foreign-currency-denominated transactions was being hedged. 
  The following table provides cash flow hedge derivative gains and losses recognized in AOCI and the amounts reclassified to income during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Table 63: Cash Flow Hedge Derivative Gains and Losses Recognized in AOCI and Reclassified to Income    

76 

     Table of Contents  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

There were   no   gains or losses reclassified into earnings during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as a result of the discontinuance of forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring. It is estimated that a net loss of   $0.7 million    and   $6.7 million   will be reclassified into net income within the next twelve months relating to cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated transactions and cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated investment securities. It is estimated that a net gain of   $1.6 million   will be reclassified into net income upon the receipt of interest payments on earning assets within the next twelve months relating to cash flow hedges of available for sale investment securities. 
  Certain foreign exchange contracts and qualifying nonderivative instruments are designated as net investment hedges to minimize Northern Trust s exposure to variability in the foreign currency translation of net investments in non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries. There was no ineffectiveness recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Amounts recorded in AOCI are reclassified to net income only upon the sale or liquidation of an investment in a non-U.S. branch or subsidiary. 
  The following table provides net investment hedge gains and losses recognized in AOCI during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Table 64: Net Investment Hedge Gains and Losses Recognized in AOCI    

Derivatives that are not formally designated as a hedge under GAAP are entered into for risk management purposes. Foreign exchange contracts are entered into to manage the foreign currency risk of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, the net investment in certain non-U.S. affiliates, commercial loans and forecasted foreign-currency-denominated transactions. Swaps related to sales of certain Visa Class B common shares were entered into which retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares.  Credit default swaps were entered into to manage credit risk associated with certain loans and loan commitments. Total return swaps are entered into to manage the equity price risk associated with certain investments.  The following table identifies the types of risk management derivative instruments not formally designated as hedges and their notional amounts and fair values.

  21. Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities 
  The following tables provide information regarding the offsetting of derivative assets and securities purchased under agreements to resell within the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

    Derivative assets are reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Other assets (excluding derivative assets) totaled   $3.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
               (2)   
    Securities purchased under agreements to resell are reported in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell in the consolidated balance sheets. Federal funds sold totaled   $15.1 million   and   $14.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
               (3)   
    Northern Trust did not possess any cash collateral that was not offset in the consolidated balance sheets that could have been used to offset the net amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
     The following tables provide information regarding the offsetting of derivative liabilities and securities sold under agreements to repurchase within the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

(1)   
    Derivative liabilities are reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Other liabilities (excluding derivative liabilities) totaled   $2.8 billion   and   $2.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
               (2)   
    Northern Trust did not place any cash collateral with counterparties that was not offset in the consolidated balance sheets that could have been used to offset the net amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
     All of Northern Trust s securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) involve the transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash subject to a right and obligation to repurchase those assets for an agreed upon amount. In the event of a repurchase failure, the cash or financial assets are available for offset. All of Northern Trust s repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are subject to a master netting arrangement, which sets forth the rights and obligations for repurchase and offset. Under the master netting arrangement, Northern Trust is entitled to set off receivables from and collateral placed with a single counterparty against obligations owed to that counterparty. In addition, collateral held by Northern Trust can be offset against receivables from that counterparty. 
  Derivative asset and liability positions with a single counterparty can be offset against each other in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist. Derivative assets and liabilities can be further offset by cash collateral received from, and deposited with, the transacting counterparty. The basis for this view is that, upon termination of transactions subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement, the individual derivative receivables do not represent resources to which general creditors have rights and individual derivative payables do not represent claims that are equivalent to the claims of general creditors. Northern Trust centrally clears those interest rate derivative instruments addressed under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These transactions are subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement which has the same rights of offset as described above. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation s management, with the participation of the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  There have been no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
