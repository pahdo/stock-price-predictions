1. Organization and Basis of Presentation  

Argos Therapeutics, Inc. (the  Company ), was incorporated in the State of
Delaware on May 8, 1997. The Company is an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized
immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer using its Arcelis technology platform. The Company s most advanced product candidate,
AGS-003, is being evaluated in the pivotal ADAPT Phase 3 clinical trial (the  ADAPT trial ) for the treatment of metastatic
renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ). The Company is also developing a separate Arcelis-based product candidate, AGS-004,
for the treatment of HIV, which is currently being evaluated in an investigator-initiated clinical trial in combination with vorinostat
aimed at HIV eradication in adult patients. 

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
by the Company in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information. The year-end condensed
consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by
U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the statements do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual consolidated
financial statements. In the opinion of management, such interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
such periods. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016 or future operating periods. The information included in these interim
financial statements should be read in conjunction with  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the consolidated financial statements and footnotes
thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The Company s consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses in each year since inception and
as of September 30, 2016, had an accumulated deficit of $316.6 million. Also as of September 30, 2016, the Company s current
assets totaled $71.3 million compared with current liabilities of $24.0 million, and the Company had cash and cash equivalents
of $69.3 million. In light of the Company s current operating plan, these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. 

Until such time, if ever, as the Company can generate substantial product revenues, it
expects to seek to raise additional funds through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government contracts, government
and other third party grants or other third party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic
alliances and licensing arrangements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate funds in these manners,
on terms acceptable to the Company, on a timely basis or at all. The failure of the Company to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable
terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition
and the Company could be forced to delay, reduce, terminate or eliminate its product development programs. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
DC Bio Corp., the Company s Canadian wholly-owned subsidiary, an unlimited liability corporation incorporated in the Province
of Nova Scotia. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Significant Accounting Policies   

There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies as of and
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with the significant accounting policies described in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less as of the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash deposits are all in financial institutions in the United
States, Canada and the European Union. The Company maintains cash in accounts which are in excess of federally insured limits.
As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, $5,913,144 and $69,033,934, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents were
uninsured. 

Restricted Cash   

The Company had restricted cash of $740,000 as of each of December 31, 2015 and September
30, 2016, which consists of funds maintained in a separate deposit account to secure a letter of credit issued by a bank to the
landlord under a lease agreement for the Company s new corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility (see Note
7). 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued  Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).  T his
ASU requires changes in the pres entation of certain items in the statement of cash flows including
but not limited to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination;
proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies and
distributions received from equity method investees.  This guidance will be effective for annual periods and interim
periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, will require adoption on a retrospective basis and
will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this standard
will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The provisions of ASU 2016-02 set out the principles for the
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). This
new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle
of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease
expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is
also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless
of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted using guidance similar to existing guidance
for operating leases. Topic 842 supersedes the previous lease standard, Topic 840  Leases . This guidance will be effective
for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and will be effective
for the Company on January 1, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the implementation of this standard will
have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2015, the FASB issued a new standard which removes the
requirement to categorize the investments for which fair value is measured using net asset value per share as a practical expedient
for fair value within the fair value hierarchy. This standard was effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2015 and was to be applied retrospectively; early adoption was permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January
1, 2016. There was no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued a new standard update which requires
debt issuance costs to be presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability.
This standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and was applied on a retrospective basis. As a result, deferred
financing costs of $93,503 were reclassified to long-term debt as of December 31, 2015. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued a new standard update that specifies the responsibility
that an entity s management has to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue
as a going concern. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and is not expected
to have an effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update pertaining to accounting
for revenue from contracts with customers. The new guidance clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common
revenue standard for U.S. GAAP. The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue
arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the most current revenue recognition guidance. In July 2015, the FASB finalized
a one-year delay in the effective date of this standard, which will now be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018,
however early adoption is permitted any time after the original effective date, which for the Company is January 1, 2017. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact that the implementation of this standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

2. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The estimated fair values of all of the Company s financial instruments, excluding
long-term debt, approximate their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and September 30,
2016. 

As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the Company held certain assets
and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These assets include money market funds included
in cash equivalents and as of December 31, 2015 included short-term investments in corporate debt securities. Additionally, as
of September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding warrants recorded as a liability and measured at fair value on a recurring basis
(see Note 9). The Company s short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale investments. As of September 30,
2016, the Company did not own any short-term investments. The valuation of these financial instruments uses a three tiered approach,
which requires that fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of three tiers. These tiers are: Level 1, defined
as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, defined as valuations based on observable
inputs other than those included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable input data; and Level 3, defined as valuations based
on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by
other market participants. 

The Company s Level 1 assets consist of money-market funds
and restricted cash in a deposit account at a bank. The method used to estimate the fair value of the Level 1 assets is based on
observable market data, as these money-market funds are publicly-traded. The Company s Level 2 assets consist of short-term
debt instruments in corporate debt securities valued using independent pricing services which normally derive security prices from
recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments based on significant observable transactions.
As of each balance sheet date, observable market inputs may include trade information, broker or dealer quotes, bids, offers or
a combination of these data sources. 

The Company s warrant liability
is classified as a Level 3 financial liability. The fair value of the warrant liability is measured using the Black-Scholes
valuation model. Inherent in the Black-Scholes valuation model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility,
expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield (see Note 9). 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no transfers
between Levels 1, 2, and 3 assets or liabilities. As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, these financial instruments
and respective fair values have been classified as follows: 

The amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses,
and estimated fair value of money-market funds included in cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt securities included in short-term
investments and restricted cash as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 were as follows: 

The fair value of the Company s debt was derived by evaluating the nature and terms
of each note, considering the prevailing economic and market conditions as of each balance sheet date and based on the Level 2
valuation hierarchy of the fair value measurements standard using a present value methodology. The fair value of the Company s
debt as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $32.0 million compared with its carrying value of $32.4 million. The fair value
of the Company s debt as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $31.1 million compared with its carrying value of $31.5
million (see Note 5). 

3. Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment consist of the following: 

Assets related to the Company s facility lease obligation and construction-in-progress
were recognized primarily due to the Company being deemed to be the accounting owner of the facility being built to be the Company s
corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility during its construction period under build-to-suit lease accounting
(see Note 7). Construction-in-progress included $2,372,880 under capital leases (see Note 7). As of December 31, 2015 and September
30, 2016, construction-in-progress included $880,334 and $2,249,785, respectively, of capitalized interest. 

Depreciation and amortization expense was as follows: 

4. Income Taxes  

The Company has incurred net operating losses since inception and is forecasting additional
losses through December 31, 2016. Therefore, no U.S. federal, state or foreign income taxes are expected for 2016 and no provision
for such taxes has been recorded as of September 30, 2016. 

Due to the Company s history of losses since inception, there is not enough evidence
at this time to support the conclusion that the Company will generate future income of a sufficient amount and nature to utilize
the benefits of the Company s net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the Company
provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets since as of that time, the Company could not assert that
it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized. 

5. Notes Payable  

Notes payable consist of the following as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016: 

Venture Loan Facility.  In September 2014, the Company entered into a venture loan
and security agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) with Horizon Technology Finance Corporation and Fortress Credit Co LLC
(together, the  Lenders ) under which the Company could borrow up to $25.0 million in two tranches of $12.5 million
each (the  Loan Facility ). 

The Company borrowed the first tranche of $12.5 million upon the closing of the Loan
Facility in September 2014 and borrowed the second tranche of $12.5 million in August 2015. The per annum interest rate for
each tranche is a floating rate equal to 9.25% plus the amount by which the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR )
exceeds 0.50% (effectively a floating rate equal to 8.75% plus the one-month LIBOR Rate). The total per annum interest rate
shall not exceed 10.75%. 

The Company incurred $449,796 in debt issuance costs in connection with the closing of
the Loan Facility. Debt issuance costs are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated
liability and amortized to interest expense over the terms of the related debt. 

The Company made payments with respect to the first tranche
of $12.5 million on an interest-only basis monthly through October 31, 2016, and is currently making monthly payments of principal
and accrued interest through the scheduled maturity date for the first tranche loan on September 30, 2018. In addition, a final
payment for the first tranche loan equal to $625,000 will be due on September 30, 2018, or such earlier date specified in the Loan
Agreement. The Company is recognizing the final payment of $625,000 as accrued interest over the expected life of the first
tranche loan. The Company has agreed to repay the second tranche loan of $12.5 million in 18 monthly payments of interest only
until February 7, 2017, followed by 24 monthly payments of principal and accrued interest through the scheduled maturity date for
the second tranche loan on February 7, 2019. In addition, a final payment of $625,000 will be due on February 7, 2019, or
such earlier date specified in the Loan Agreement. The Company is recognizing the final payment of $625,000 as accrued interest
over the expected life of the second tranche loan. In addition, the Company has agreed that if the Company repays all or a portion
of the loan prior to the applicable maturity date, it will pay the Lenders a prepayment penalty fee based on a percentage of the
then outstanding principal balance, equal to 3% if the prepayment occurs on or before 24 months after the funding date, 2% if the
prepayment occurs more than 24 months after, but on or before 36 months after, the funding date thereof, or 1% if the prepayment
occurs more than 36 months after the funding date thereof. 

The Company s obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority
security interest in substantially all of its assets other than its intellectual property. The Company also has agreed not to pledge
or otherwise encumber its intellectual property assets, subject to certain exceptions. 

The Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, but does
not include any covenants to attain or maintain certain financial metrics, and also includes customary events of default, including
payment defaults, breaches of covenants, change of control and a material adverse change default. Upon the occurrence of an
event of default and following any applicable cure periods, a default interest rate of an additional 5% may be applied to the outstanding
loan balances, and the Lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions
as set forth in the Loan Agreement. 

In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company issued to the Lenders and their affiliates
warrants to purchase a total of 82,780 shares of the Company s common stock at a per share exercise price of $9.06 (the
 Venture Loan Warrants ). Upon the Company s satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the making of
the second tranche loan, the Venture Loan Warrants became exercisable in full. The Venture Loan Warrants will terminate on
September 29, 2021 or such earlier date as specified in the Venture Loan Warrants. As of September 29, 2014, the Company
recorded a debt discount of $338,673 equal to the value of these Venture Loan Warrants. This debt discount is offset
against the long-term portion of the note payable balance and included in additional paid-in capital on the Company's consolidated
balance sheet. 

Medinet Loan.  In December 2013, in connection with a license agreement currently
with Medinet Co., Ltd and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MEDcell Co., Ltd. (together "Medinet"), as described in Note 11,
the Company borrowed $9.0 million pursuant to an unsecured promissory note that bears interest at a rate of 3.0% per annum. The
principal and interest under the note are due and payable on December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the note and the license agreement,
any milestone payments related to the developmental and regulatory milestones that become due will be applied first to the repayment
of the loan. The Company has the right to prepay the loan at any time. If the Company has not repaid the loan by December 31, 2018,
then the Company has agreed to grant to Medinet a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license to make and sell Arcelis products in Japan
for the treatment of cancer. In such event, the amounts owing under the loan as of December 31, 2018 may constitute pre-paid royalties
under the license or would be due and payable. Royalties under this license would be paid until the expiration of the licensed
patent rights in Japan at a rate to be negotiated. If the Company and Medinet cannot agree on the royalty rate, they have agreed
to submit the matter to arbitration. Because the $9.0 million promissory note was issued at a below market interest rate, the Company
allocated the proceeds of the loan between the license agreement and the debt at the time of issuance. Accordingly, as of the borrowing
date, December 31, 2013, the Company recorded $6.9 million to notes payable, based upon an effective interest rate of 8.0%, and
$2.1 million as a deferred liability. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a $1.0 million milestone
payment as deferred revenue under the Medinet license agreement and reduced the related note payable by $0.8 million and the deferred
liability by $0.2 million. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of the note payable was $7.5 million, including $1.3 million of
accrued interest. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a $2.0 million milestone payment as deferred
revenue under this license agreement and reduced the related note payable by $1.5 million and the deferred liability by $0.5 million.
As of September 30, 2016, the amount of the note payable was $6.3 million, including $1.7 million of accrued interest. As of December
31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the total deferred liability associated with the Medinet note was $3.8 million and $5.3 million,
respectively (see Note 11). 

Other Notes.  During November 2013, the Company borrowed $77,832 from a lending
institution to finance the purchase of computer equipment, of which $46,754 and $35,040 in principal was outstanding as of December
31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. Borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the computer equipment financed
under the agreement, bear interest at a rate of 8.31% per annum and are to be repaid in 60 equal monthly installments commencing
on the date of borrowing. 

6. Manufacturing Research and Development Obligation  

In October 2014, the Company entered into a development agreement (the  Invetech
Development Agreement ) with Invetech Pty Ltd ( Invetech ). The Invetech Development Agreement supersedes
and replaces the development agreement entered into by the parties in July 2005. Under the Invetech Development Agreement,
Invetech will continue to develop and provide prototypes of the automated production system to be used for the manufacture of the
Company s Arcelis-based products (the  Production Systems ). Development services will be performed on a
proposal by proposal basis. 

Invetech has agreed to defer 30% of its fees, but such deferral will not exceed
$5.0 million. Deferred fees (plus interest of 7% per annum) would become payable either, at the Company s option, in
a lump sum within 90 days of the  Sunset Date Trigger Event  or pursuant to an installment plan (either in four
installments payable within the first year or eight installments payable within the first two years after the  Sunset
Date Trigger Event ). The  Sunset Date Trigger Event  is December 31, 2016. Invetech is entitled to
a 10% bonus payment if the ADAPT trial is closed early indicating positive efficacy or if the ADAPT trial meets the primary endpoint
of overall survival and the 100% of events analysis indicates positive efficacy, and if Invetech has timely completed all activities
up to the time the ADAPT trial is stopped. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company recorded this manufacturing research and development
obligation on its consolidated balance sheet at $7.8 million, representing $5.2 million in deferred fees, $2.3 million in estimated
bonus payments and $0.3 million in accrued interest. As of September 30, 2016, the Company recorded this manufacturing research
and development obligation on its consolidated balance sheet at $8.1 million, representing $5.2 million in deferred fees, $2.3
million in estimated bonus payments and $0.5 million in accrued interest, of which $2.9 million is included in current liabilities
as the current portion of the obligation. 

The Invetech Development Agreement requires the parties to discuss in good faith Invetech s
supply of Production Systems for use in manufacturing commercial product. The Company has an obligation to purchase $25.0 million
worth of Production Systems, components, subsystems and spare parts for commercial use. Once that obligation has been satisfied,
the Company has the right to have a third party supply Production Systems for use in manufacturing commercial product provided
that Invetech has a right of first refusal with respect to any offer by a third party and the Company may not accept an offer from
a third party unless that offer is at a price that is less than that offered by Invetech and otherwise under substantially the
same or better terms. The Company will own all intellectual property arising from the development services (with the exception
of existing Invetech intellectual property incorporated therein under which the Company will have a license). The Invetech
Development Agreement will continue until the completion of the development of the Production Systems. The Invetech Development
Agreement can be terminated early by either party because of a technical failure or by the Company without cause. 

7. Facility Lease Obligation and Capital Lease Obligations  

Facility Lease Obligation   

In August 2014, the Company entered into a Lease Agreement
(the  Lease Agreement ) with TKC LXXII, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company ( TKC ). Under
the Lease Agreement, the Company agreed to lease certain land and an approximately 125,000 square-foot building to be constructed
in Durham County, North Carolina, which the Company refers to as Centerpoint. The Company intended this facility to be built to
house the Company s corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility. The lease for the current facility expires
in November 2017. The shell of the new facility was constructed on a build-to-suit basis by TKC in accordance with agreed upon
specifications and plans as set forth in the Lease Agreement and at the expense of TKC, other than those costs resulting from changes
requested by the Company, for which the Company has paid $1.7 million as of September 30, 2016. 

The term of the Lease Agreement is 10 years from the commencement date of July
1, 2015. The Company has an option to extend the Lease Agreement by six five-year renewal terms. Current rent payments in the
second year are $47,972 per month, subject to certain fixed increases over the course of the term as set forth in the Lease Agreement. 

The Lease Agreement required the Company to provide TKC with a letter of credit. The
Company provided the bank that issued the letter of credit on its behalf a security deposit of $1,325,000 to guarantee the letter
of credit. In accordance with the Lease Agreement, this deposit was reduced to $740,000 as of December 31, 2015 under a purchase
and sale agreement with TKC. The deposit is recorded as restricted cash as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 on the Company s
consolidated balance sheets. 

Under the Lease Agreement, the Company is involved in the construction of the building.
To the extent the Company is involved with the structural improvements of the construction project or takes construction risk prior
to the commencement of a lease, ASC 840-40-05-5 requires for accounting purposes that the Company be considered the owner of this
project during the construction period. Therefore, the Company recorded an asset in property and equipment, net on the Company s
consolidated balance sheets for the cost of the Company s portion of the building plus the amount of estimated structural
construction costs incurred by TKC and the Company as of the applicable balance sheet date. The Company recorded a corresponding
facility lease obligation on its consolidated balance sheets representing the amounts paid by TKC. 

The initial recording of these assets and liabilities is classified as non-cash investing
and financing items, respectively, for purposes of the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company recorded
an asset related to the facility lease obligation included in property and equipment of $7.6 million and $7.9 million as of December
31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. The facility lease obligation on the Company s consolidated balance sheet
is $7.2 million and $7.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Under the Lease Agreement, the Company had an option to purchase the property. In February
2015, the Company exercised this purchase option and entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement )
with TKC. The purchase price to be paid by the Company at closing was $7.4 million plus the amount of any additional costs incurred
by TKC as a result of changes requested by the Company, for which the Company had paid $1.7 million as of September 30, 2016,
and the amount of any improvement allowances advanced to the Company by TKC prior to the closing. Under the terms of the Purchase
Agreement, the Company had until October 31, 2016 to consummate the purchase of the property. The Company did not purchase the
property by such date. As a result, the Company has no further right to purchase the property and remains subject to the lease
under the Lease Agreement. 

Capital Lease Obligations   

In August 2016, the Company entered into two agreements
(the  Power Generation Agreements ) with an electric utility company. The Power Generation Agreements are being accounted
for as capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Under the lease agreements, the electric utility company agreed to design,
procure, install, own and maintain electrical equipment at Centerpoint to provide required electrical loads. The Power Generation
Agreements require monthly minimum payments of $32,948 for a period of 128 months, or a total of $4.2 million ending in March 2027.
Property, plant and equipment as of September 30, 2016 included $2.4 million under the Power Generation Agreements. 

Future minimum payments due under the Power Generation Agreements are as follows as of
September 30, 2016: 

8. Stockholders  (Deficit) Equity  

Issuance of Common Stock in the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   

PIPE Financing  

On March 4, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the
 Securities Purchase Agreement ) with certain investors (the  Investors ), pursuant to which the Company
agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of up to $60 million of the Company s common stock (the  Shares ) and warrants
to purchase shares of common stock (the  Warrants ) in a private placement (the  PIPE Financing ). Investors
participating in the PIPE Financing included Pharmstandard, ForArgos B.V., Tianyi Lummy International Holdings Group Ltd. ( Tianyi
Lummy ), China BioPharma Capital I, L.P. ( China BioPharma ), TVM V Life Science Ventures GmbH   Co.
KG and Wasatch Funds Trust. Andrei Petrov, Igor Krol, Hubert Birner and Sander van Deventer (collectively, the  Investor
Directors ), who are members of the Company s board of directors, are affiliated with certain of the Investors. 

The PIPE Financing was to take place in up to three tranches. Under the Securities Purchase
Agreement, at the initial closing, which occurred on March 14, 2016, the Company sold and the Investors purchased for a total
purchase price of $19,882,915 a total of 3,652,430 Shares and Warrants to purchase a total of 2,739,323 shares of common stock
(0.75 shares of common stock for each Share purchased), based on a purchase price per Share and accompanying Warrant equal to $5.44375
(the  Purchase Price ). At the second closing, which occurred on June 29, 2016, the Company sold and the Investors
purchased for a total purchase price of $29,824,520 a total of 5,478,672 Shares and Warrants to purchase a total of 4,109,005 shares
of common stock (0.75 shares of common stock for each Share purchased), based on a purchase price per Share and accompanying Warrant
equal to the Purchase Price. The closing of the second tranche was triggered by the recommendation from the Company s independent
data monitoring committee (the  IDMC ) that the Company continue the ADAPT trial based on the results of the IDMC s
scheduled interim data review. The Warrants have an exercise price of $5.35 per share, expire on the fifth anniversary of the date
of issuance and have other terms described below under  Warrants.  

Under the Securities Purchase Agreement, Pharmstandard International S.A. ( Pharmstandard )
agreed that, at the Company s option following the satisfaction of certain conditions, it could be required to purchase at
a third closing up to $10,292,563 of Shares (without Warrants). The dollar amount of Shares to be purchased by Pharmstandard at
the third closing was subject to reduction on a dollar-for-dollar basis for certain cash amounts raised by the Company after the
initial closing through equity or debt financings or collaborations. The net proceeds received from the sale of common stock and
accompanying warrants in the Company s follow-on public offering that closed on August 2, 2016 (see below) reduced in full
the dollar amount committed to be purchased in the third tranche and as a result the Company has no further ability to effect the
closing of, and Pharmstandard has no further obligation to purchase Shares in, the third tranche of the PIPE Financing. 

The Company agreed to pay at each closing the legal expenses of the Investors and the
legal expenses of the Investors incurred in connection with the resale registration obligations of the Company set forth in the
Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below); provided, however, that the Company had no obligation to pay more than a total
of $140,000 with respect to such expenses. 

The Company has granted the Investors, and the Investors have granted the Company, indemnification
rights with respect to its or their representations, warranties, covenants and agreements under the Securities Purchase Agreement. 

Warrants  

The Warrants issued at the first closing and second closing are exercisable for shares
of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $5.35 per share on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of
issuance, are immediately exercisable, and are exercisable for cash or by cashless exercise in certain limited circumstances. 

Registration Rights Agreement  

On March 4, 2016, in connection with entering into the Securities Purchase Agreement,
the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ) with the Investors,
pursuant to which the Company agreed to register for resale the Shares and the shares of the Company s common stock issued
upon exercise of the Warrants (the  Warrant Shares,  and together with the Shares, the  Registrable Securities ).
Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed to use its best efforts to file a registration statement after each
closing covering the Shares and the Warrant Shares underlying the Warrants sold at such closing, as applicable, and to use its
best efforts to keep such registration statement effective until the date the Shares and Warrant Shares covered by such registration
statement have been sold or may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without restriction. 

A registration statement covering the Shares and Warrant Shares purchased at the initial
closing was filed on May 13, 2016 and declared effective on May 26, 2016. A registration statement covering the Shares and Warrant
Shares purchased at the second closing was filed on July 22, 2016 and declared effective on August 16, 2016. In the event that
either registration statement is not available to cover any sales of Registrable Securities registered by such registration statement,
then the Company has agreed to make pro rata payments to each Investor holding such Registrable Securities as liquidated damages
in an amount equal to 1% of the aggregate amount invested by each such Investor for such Registrable Securities per 30-day period
or pro rata for any portion thereof following the date by which such Registration Statement should have been effective, subject
to specified exceptions. 

The Company has granted the Investors, and the Investors have granted to the Company,
customary indemnification rights in connection with the registration statements. 

At-the-market Offering  

In May 2015, the Company entered into a sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with
Cowen   Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell shares of the Company s common stock
from time to time having an aggregate offering price of up to $30 million through Cowen, acting as the Company s agent. Sales
of the Company s common stock through Cowen may be made by any method permitted that is deemed an  at the market offering 
as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through the Nasdaq Global
Market, sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange or otherwise, in negotiated transactions at market prices,
and/or any other method permitted by law. Cowen is not required to sell any specific amount, but acts as the Company s sales
agent using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices. Shares sold pursuant to the
Sales Agreement have been sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement, which became effective on May 14, 2015. Under the Sales
Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay Cowen a commission of up to 3% of the gross proceeds of any sales made pursuant to the
Sales Agreement. As of November 7, 2016, the Company has sold 872,682 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement, resulting
in proceeds of $5.5 million, net of commissions and issuance costs. 

Follow-On Public Offering  

On August 2, 2016, the Company issued and sold 9,090,909 shares of common stock and warrants
to purchase an aggregate of 6,818,181 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $5.50
per share and accompanying warrant. The shares of common stock and warrants were sold in combination, with one warrant to purchase
up to 0.75 of a share of common stock accompanying each share of common stock sold. The warrants have an exercise price of $5.50
per share, became immediately exercisable upon issuance and will expire on August 2, 2021. The aggregate net proceeds to the Company
of the offering were approximately $48.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 

Other Common Stock Issued in the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016  

In lieu of paying certain annual cash bonuses for 2015, in January 2016 the Company granted
restricted stock awards to certain of its executive officers and employees. The number of shares granted to each executive officer
and employee was calculated by dividing the amount of the 2015 annual cash bonus that would otherwise have been paid to such executive
officer or employee by the closing price of the Company s common stock on January 8, 2016 of $2.24 per share. A total of
296,936 shares of restricted common stock with a value of $665,137 were issued. Each of the restricted stock awards is subject
to a lapsing right of repurchase in the Company s favor, which right will lapse with respect to 100% of the underlying shares
of each award on November 20, 2016, assuming such executive or employee is still providing services to the Company on such date. 

For 2016, the Company s board of directors determined
that each non-employee director will receive shares of the Company s common stock under the Company s 2014 stock incentive
plan in lieu of cash board fees on the last day of each calendar quarter in 2016. The number of shares to be granted to each non-employee
director on a quarterly basis shall be that number of whole shares of the Company s common stock equal to the dollar amount
of such director s fees for a given calendar quarter divided by the closing share price of the Company s common stock
on the last trading day of such calendar quarter. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued
14,207 and 37,770 shares, respectively, of its common stock as board compensation to non-employee directors in lieu of $70,609
and $218,424, respectively, in cash board fees and such amounts are included in general and administrative expenses. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company recorded share-based expense in connection with the grant of restricted stock to certain employees and a consultant of
$64,137 and $107,366, respectively. Of these amounts, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $47,149 and $85,239,
respectively, is included in general and administrative expenses, and $16,988 and $22,127, respectively, is included in research
and development expenses. 

9. Stock Options and Warrants  

2014 Stock Incentive Plan and 2014 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan   

In January 2014, the Company s board of directors and stockholders approved, effective
upon the closing of the Company s initial public offering, the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ). Under
the 2014 Plan, the Company may grant incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards for the purchase of that number of shares of common stock equal to the
sum of 1,951,182 shares, plus such number of shares, up to 357,841 shares, as is equal to the sum of the number of shares reserved
for issuance under the Company s 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2008 Plan ) that remained available for grant
under the 2008 Plan immediately prior to the closing of the Company s initial public offering on February 12, 2014 (381,250
shares) and the number of shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2008 Plan that expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered,
cancelled, forfeited or repurchased by the Company at their original issuance price pursuant to a contractual repurchase right,
plus an annual increase, to be added on the first day of each fiscal year from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2024, equal
to the lowest of 2,309,023 shares of common stock, 4% of the number of the Company s outstanding shares on the first day
of each such fiscal year and an amount determined by the Company s board of directors. 

Also in January 2014, the Company s board of directors and stockholders approved,
effective upon the closing of the Company s initial public offering, a 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  2014
ESPP ). Under the 2014 ESPP, on the offering commencement date of each plan period (the  Purchase Plan Period ),
the Company will grant to each eligible employee who is then a participant in the 2014 ESPP an option to purchase shares of common
stock. The employee may authorize up to a maximum of 10% of his or her base pay to be deducted by the Company during each Purchase
Plan Period. Each employee who continues to be a participant in the 2014 ESPP on the last business day of the Purchase Plan Period
is deemed to have exercised the option, to the extent of accumulated payroll deductions within the 2014 ESPP ownership limits. 

Under the terms of the 2014 ESPP, the option exercise price shall be determined by the
Company s board of directors for each Purchase Plan Period and the option exercise price will be at least 85% of the applicable
closing price of the common stock. The option exercise price will be 85% of the lower of the Company s closing stock price
on the first and last business day of each Purchase Plan Period. The Company s first Purchase Plan Period commenced on September
2, 2014 and ended on February 27, 2015. For the first Purchase Plan Period, 13,054 shares were purchased with employee withholdings
at an option exercise price based upon 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning of the first Purchase Plan Period
of $9.83 and the closing price on February 27, 2015 of $9.02, resulting in the recognition of stock-based compensation expense
of $54,508. The Company s second Purchase Plan Period commenced on March 2, 2015 and ended on August 31, 2015. For the second
Purchase Plan Period, 20,301 shares were purchased with employee withholdings at an option exercise price based upon 85% of the
lower of the closing price at the beginning of the second Purchase Plan Period of $9.02 and the closing price on August 31, 2015
of $6.21, resulting in the recognition of stock-based compensation expense of $72,800. The Company s third Purchase Plan
Period commenced on September 1, 2015 and ended on February 29, 2016. For the third Purchase Plan Period, 36,290 shares were purchased
with employee withholdings at an option exercise price based upon 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning of the
third Purchase Plan Period of $6.24 and the closing price of $4.44 on February 29, 2016, resulting in the recognition of stock-based
compensation expense of $107,455. The Company s fourth Purchase Plan Period commenced on March 1, 2016 and ended on August
31, 2016. For the fourth Purchase Plan Period, 30,157 shares were purchased with employee withholdings at an option exercise price
based upon 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning of the fourth Purchase Plan Period of $4.91 and the closing price
of $4.95 on August 31, 2016, resulting in the recognition of stock-based compensation expense of $63,788. The Company s fifth
Purchase Plan Period commenced on September 1, 2016 and will end on February 28, 2017. 

Upon the exercise of stock options, vesting of other awards and purchase of shares through
the 2014 ESPP or under the 2014 Plan, the Company issues new shares of common stock. All awards granted under the 2014 Plan that
are canceled prior to vesting or expire unexercised are returned to the approved pool of reserved shares under the 2014 Plan and
made available for future grants. As of September 30, 2016, there were 691,740 shares of common stock remaining available for future
issuance under the 2014 Plan and 246,551 shares of common stock remaining available for future issuance under the 2014 ESPP. 

The Company recorded the following stock-based compensation expense: 

Allocations to research and development and general and administrative expenses are based
upon the department to which the associated employee reported. No related tax benefits of the stock-based compensation expense
have been recognized. Stock-based payments issued to nonemployees are recorded at their fair values, and are periodically revalued
as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, modifications were made to certain stock option grants that accelerated the vesting of such grants to 18 terminated employees
resulting in an increase to stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company granted options to employees
to purchase a total of 80,400 shares of the Company s common stock at exercise prices ranging from $6.21 to $6.68 per share,
which in each instance was the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date. During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company granted options to employees to purchase a total of 395,373 shares of the Company s common
stock at exercise prices ranging from $4.86 to $6.30 per share, which in each instance was the closing price of the Company s
common stock on the grant date. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company granted options to employees
and non-employee directors to purchase a total of 702,700 shares of the Company s common stock at exercise prices ranging
from $6.21 to $9.01 per share, which in each instance was the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted options to employees to purchase a total of 1,605,479 shares
of the Company s common stock at exercise prices ranging from $2.16 to $10.97 per share, which in each instance was the closing
price of the Company s common stock on the grant date, except for 565,000 options granted to the Company s executive
committee employees which have an exercise price of $7.41 compared with the $5.95 closing price of the Company s common stock
on the grant date. 

The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016: 

Valuation Assumptions for Stock Option Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan   

The employee stock-based compensation expense recognized was determined using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model. Option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over
time. The weighted average assumptions used were as follows for the periods indicated: 

Warrants   

As discussed in Note 8 regarding the PIPE Financing, on March 14, 2016, the Company
sold and the Investors purchased for a total purchase price of $19,882,915 a total of 3,652,430 Shares and Warrants to purchase
a total of 2,739,323 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $5.35. These Warrants will terminate on March 14,
2021 or such earlier date as specified in the Warrants. Additionally, on June 29, 2016, the Company sold and the Investors
purchased for a total purchase price of $29,824,520 a total of 5,478,672 Shares and Warrants to purchase a total of 4,109,005 shares

common stock for proceeds of $299,932 to the Company. 

As discussed in Note 8, regarding the Follow-On Public Offering, on August 2, 2016,
the Company sold and the investors purchased for a total purchase price of $50.0 million a total of 9,090,909 shares and warrants
to purchase a total of 6,818,181 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $5.50. These warrants will terminate on
August 2, 2021 or such earlier date as specified in the warrants. 

As discussed in Note 5 regarding the Company s notes payable,
in connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company issued to the Lenders and their affiliates warrants to purchase a total of 82,780
shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $9.06. Upon the Company s satisfaction of the conditions precedent
to the making of the second tranche loan, the warrants became exercisable in full. The warrants will terminate on September
29, 2021 or such earlier date as specified in the warrants.    

As of September 30, 2016, outstanding warrants to purchase a total of 13,693,227 shares
of the Company s common stock were as follows: 

The following warrants were issued on August
2, 2016 (the  August 2016 Warrants ) and remained outstanding as of September 30, 2016, and include provisions
that could require cash settlement of the August 2016 warrants. The August 2016 Warrants are therefore recorded as liabilities
of the Company at the estimated fair value as of the date of issuance. The August 2016 Warrants are required to be recorded at
fair value as of the end of each subsequent reporting period, with changes in fair value recorded as other income or expense in
the Company s statement of operations in each subsequent period: 

The fair value of the August 2016 Warrants
is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Inherent in the Black-Scholes valuation model are assumptions related
to expected stock price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate is based
on the U.S. Treasury five-year maturity yield curve in effect on the date of valuation. The dividend yield percentage is zero because
the Company neither currently pays dividends nor intends to do so during the expected term of the August 2016 Warrants. Expected
stock price volatility is based on an average of several peer public companies. The expected life of the August 2016 Warrants is
assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The assumptions used by the Company to determine the fair value of
the August 2016 warrants are summarized in the following table as of the date of issuance and as of September 30, 2016: 

In November 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with
Pharmstandard under which Pharmstandard purchased additional shares of the Company s Series E preferred stock. Upon the closing
of the Company s initial public offering, all of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically
converted into 13,188,251 shares of the Company s common stock.  Under this agreement, the Company agreed to enter into
a manufacturing rights agreement for the European market with Pharmstandard, which also provided for the issuance of warrants to
Pharmstandard to purchase 499,788 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $5.82 per share. As of September 30,
2016, the Company had not entered into this manufacturing rights agreement or issued such warrants. 

10. Revenue and Concentration of Credit Risk  

In September 2006, the Company entered into a multi-year research contract with the National
Institutes of Health ( NIH ) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) to
design, develop and clinically test an autologous HIV immunotherapy capable of eliciting therapeutic immune responses. The Company
is using funds from this contract to develop AGS-004. Under this contract, as amended, the NIH and NIAID have committed to fund
up to a total of $39.8 million, including reimbursement of direct expenses and allocated overhead and general and administrative
expenses of up to $38.4 million and payment of other specified amounts totaling up to $1.4 million upon the Company s achievement
of specified development milestones. Since September 2010, the Company has received reimbursement of its allocated overhead and
general and administrative expenses at provisional indirect cost rates equal to negotiated provisional indirect cost rates agreed
to with the NIH and NIAID in September 2010. These provisional indirect cost rates are subject to adjustment based on the Company s
actual costs pursuant to the agreement with the NIH and NIAID. This commitment originally extended until May 2013. The Company
agreed to an additional modification of the Company s contract with the NIH and NIAID under which the NIH and NIAID agreed
to increase their funding commitment to the Company by an additional $5.4 million in connection with the extension of the contract
from May 2013 to September 2015. Additionally, a contract modification for a $0.5 million increase was agreed to by the NIH on
September 18, 2014 to cover a portion of the manufacturing costs of the planned Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 for long-term
viral control in pediatric patients. This modification extended the NIH and NIAID s commitment under the contract to July
2016. On June 29, 2016, a contract modification was agreed to that extended the NIH and NIAID s commitment under the contract
to July 31, 2018. The Company has agreed to a statement of work under the contract, and is obligated to furnish all the services,
qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the U.S. government, needed to perform the statement
of work. 

The Company recognizes revenue from reimbursements earned in connection with the contract
as reimbursable costs are incurred and recognizes revenues from the achievement of milestones under the NIH and NIAID contract
upon the accomplishment of any such milestone. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, the Company recorded revenue
under this agreement of $130,849 and $119,256, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, the Company
recorded revenue under this agreement of $374,455 and $671,828, respectively. The Company has recorded total revenue of $37.8 million
through September 30, 2016 under the NIH and NIAID agreement. As of September 30, 2016, there was up to $2.0 million
of potential revenue remaining to be earned under the agreement with the NIH and NIAID. As of December 31, 2015 and September
30, 2016, the Company recorded a receivable from the NIH and NIAID of $73,818 and $119,256, respectively. The concentration of
credit risk is equal to the outstanding accounts receivable and such risk is subject to the credit worthiness of the NIH and NIAID.
There have been no credit losses under this arrangement. 

11. Collaboration Agreements  

Pharmstandard License Agreement   

In August 2013, Pharmstandard purchased shares of the Company s series E preferred
stock. Concurrently with such purchase, the Company entered into an exclusive royalty-bearing license agreement with Pharmstandard.
Under this license agreement, the Company granted Pharmstandard and its affiliates a license, with the right to sublicense, develop,
manufacture and commercialize AGS-003 and other products for the treatment of human diseases, which are developed by Pharmstandard
using the Company s individualized immunotherapy platform, in the Russian Federation, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, which the Company refers to as the Pharmstandard
Territory. The Company also provided Pharmstandard with a right of first negotiation for development and commercialization rights
in the Pharmstandard Territory to specified additional products the Company may develop. 

Under the terms of the license agreement, Pharmstandard licensed the Company rights to
clinical data generated by Pharmstandard under the agreement and granted the Company an option to obtain an exclusive license outside
of the Pharmstandard Territory to develop and commercialize improvements to the Company s Arcelis technology generated by
Pharmstandard under the agreement, a non-exclusive worldwide royalty-free license to Pharmstandard improvements to manufacture
products using the Company s Arcelis technology and a license to specified follow-on licensed products generated by Pharmstandard
outside of the Pharmstandard Territory, each on terms to be negotiated upon the Company s request for a license. In addition,
Pharmstandard agreed to pay the Company pass-through royalties on net sales of all licensed products in the low single digits until
it has generated a specified amount of aggregate net sales. Once the net sales threshold is achieved, Pharmstandard will pay the
Company royalties on net sales of specified licensed products, including AGS-003, in the low double digits below 20%. These royalty
obligations last until the later of the expiration of specified licensed patent rights in a country or the twelfth anniversary
of the first commercial sale in such country on a country by country basis and no further royalties on specified other licensed
products. After the net sales threshold is achieved, Pharmstandard has the right to offset a portion of the royalties Pharmstandard
pays to third parties for licenses to necessary third party intellectual property against the royalties that Pharmstandard pays
to the Company. 

The agreement will terminate upon expiration of the royalty term, upon which all licenses
will become fully paid-up perpetual exclusive licenses. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party s uncured
material breach or if specified conditions occur relating to the other party s insolvency or bankruptcy and the Company may
terminate the agreement if Pharmstandard challenges or assists a third party in challenging specified patent rights of ours. If
Pharmstandard terminates the agreement upon the Company s material breach or bankruptcy, Pharmstandard is entitled to terminate
the Company s licenses to improvements generated by Pharmstandard, upon which the Company may come to rely for the development
and commercialization of AGS-003 and other licensed products outside of the Pharmstandard Territory, and to retain its licenses
from the Company and to pay the Company substantially reduced royalty payments following such termination. 

In November 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with
Pharmstandard under which Pharmstandard purchased additional shares of the Company s series E preferred stock. Under this
agreement, the Company agreed to enter into a manufacturing rights agreement for the European market with Pharmstandard, which
also provided for the issuance of warrants to Pharmstandard to purchase 499,788 shares of the Company s common stock at an
exercise price of $5.82 per share. The Company has not entered into this manufacturing rights agreement or issued the warrants.
All outstanding shares of the Company s preferred stock converted into shares of the Company s common stock upon the
closing of its initial public offering in February 2014. 

Green Cross License Agreement   

In July 2013, the Company entered into an exclusive royalty-bearing license agreement
with Green Cross Corp. ("Green Cross"). Under this agreement, the Company granted Green Cross a license to develop, manufacture
and commercialize AGS-003 for mRCC in South Korea. The Company also provided Green Cross with a right of first negotiation for
development and commercialization rights in South Korea to specified additional products the Company may develop. 

Under the terms of the license, Green Cross has agreed to pay the Company $500,000 upon
the initial submission of an application for regulatory approval of a licensed product in South Korea, $500,000 upon the initial
regulatory approval of a licensed product in South Korea and royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits
below 20% on net sales until the fifteenth anniversary of the first commercial sale in South Korea. In addition, Green Cross has
granted the Company an exclusive royalty free license to develop and commercialize all Green Cross improvements to the Company s
licensed intellectual property in the rest of the world, excluding South Korea, except that, as to such improvements for which
Green Cross makes a significant financial investment and that generate significant commercial benefit in the rest of the world,
the Company is required to negotiate in good faith a reasonable royalty that the Company will be obligated to pay to Green Cross
for such license. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is required to continue to develop and to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain regulatory approval for AGS-003 in the United States.  

The agreement will terminate upon expiration of the royalty
term, which is 15 years from the first commercial sale, upon which all licenses will become fully paid up perpetual non-exclusive
licenses. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party s uncured material breach or if specified conditions
occur relating to the other party s insolvency or bankruptcy and the Company may terminate the agreement if Green Cross challenges
or assists a third party in challenging specified patent rights of the Company. If Green Cross terminates the agreement upon the
Company s material breach or bankruptcy, Green Cross is entitled to terminate the Company s licenses to improvements
and retain its licenses from the Company and to pay the Company substantially reduced milestone and royalty payments following
such termination. 

Medinet License Agreement   

In December 2013, the Company entered into a license agreement with Medinet Co., Ltd.
This agreement was subsequently novated, amended and restated among the Company, Medinet Co., Ltd. and MEDcell Co., Ltd. in October
2014. Pursuant to the novation, Medinet Co., Ltd. assigned and transferred all of its rights and obligations under the original
license agreement, including the rights to receive payments under the $9.0 million note in favor of Medinet Co., Ltd., to MEDcell
Co., Ltd. without any substantive change in the underlying rights or obligations. Medinet Co., Ltd. and MEDcell Co., Ltd. together
are referred to herein as  Medinet.  Under this agreement, the Company granted Medinet an exclusive, royalty-free license
to manufacture in Japan AGS-003 and other products using the Company s Arcelis technology solely for the purpose of the development
and commercialization of AGS-003 and these other products for the treatment of mRCC. The Company refers to this license as the
manufacturing license. 

In addition, under this agreement, the Company granted Medinet an option to acquire a
nonexclusive, royalty-bearing license under the Company s Arcelis technology to sell in Japan AGS-003 and other products
for the treatment of mRCC. The Company refers to the option as the sale option and the license as the sale license. This option
expired on April 30, 2016. As a result, Medinet may only manufacture AGS-003 and these other products for the Company or its designee.
The Company and Medinet have agreed to negotiate in good faith a supply agreement under which Medinet would supply the Company
or its designee with AGS-003 and these other products for development and sale for the treatment of mRCC in Japan. During the term
of the manufacturing license, the Company may not manufacture AGS-003 or these other products for the Company or any designee for
development or sale for the treatment of mRCC in Japan. 

In consideration for the manufacturing license, Medinet paid the Company $1.0 million.
Medinet also loaned the Company $9.0 million in connection with the Company entering into the agreement. The Company has agreed
to use these funds in the development and manufacturing of AGS-003 and the other products. Medinet also agreed to pay the Company
milestone payments of up to a total of $9.0 million upon the achievement of developmental and regulatory milestones and $5.0 million
upon the achievement of a sales milestone related to AGS-003 and these products. Under the terms of the note and the manufacturing
license agreement, any milestone payments related to the developmental and regulatory milestones that become due will be applied
first to the repayment of the loan. The first milestone with a $1.0 million payment was achieved in July 2015 and the second milestone
with a $2.0 million payment was achieved in June 2016, reducing the outstanding principal of the loan as of September 30, 2016
to $6.0 million. 

In December 2013, in connection with the manufacturing license agreement with Medinet,
the Company borrowed $9.0 million pursuant to an unsecured promissory note that bears interest at a rate of 3.0% per annum.
The principal and interest under the note are due and payable on December 31, 2018. The Company has the right to prepay the
loan at any time. If the Company has not repaid the loan by December 31, 2018, then the Company has agreed to grant to Medinet
a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license to make and sell Arcelis products in Japan for the treatment of cancer. In such event,
the amounts owing under the loan as of December 31, 2018 may constitute pre-paid royalties under the license or would be due and
payable. Royalties under this license would be paid until the expiration of the licensed patent rights in Japan at a rate to be
negotiated. If the Company and Medinet cannot agree on the royalty rate, the Company and Medinet have agreed to submit the matter
to arbitration. 

The Company recorded the initial $1.0 million payment from Medinet as a deferred liability.
In addition, because the $9.0 million promissory note was issued at a below market interest rate, the Company allocated the proceeds
of the loan between the manufacturing license agreement and the debt at the time of issuance. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2013,
the date of borrowing, the Company recorded $6.9 million to notes payable, based upon an effective interest rate of 8.0%, and $2.1
million as a deferred liability. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a $1.0 million milestone payment
as deferred revenue under the license agreement and reduced the related note payable by $0.8 million and the deferred liability
by $0.2 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a $2.0 million milestone payment as deferred
revenue under this license agreement and reduced the related note payable by $1.5 million and the deferred liability by $0.5 million.
As of September 30, 2016, the amount of the note payable was $6.3 million, including $1.7 million accrued interest. As of September
30, 2016, the total deferred liability associated with the Medinet note was $5.3 million. 

The agreement will terminate upon expiration of the royalty term, upon which all licenses
will become fully paid up, perpetual non-exclusive licenses. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party s
uncured material breach or if specified conditions occur relating to the other party s insolvency or bankruptcy, and the
Company may terminate the agreement if Medinet challenges or assists a third party in challenging specified patent rights of the
Company. If Medinet terminates the agreement upon the Company s material breach or bankruptcy, Medinet is entitled to terminate
the Company s licenses to improvements and retain its royalty-bearing licenses from the Company. 

Lummy License Agreement   

On April 7, 2015, the Company and Lummy (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd. ( Lummy HK ),
a wholly owned subsidiary of Chongqing Lummy Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., entered into a license agreement (the  License Agreement )
whereby the Company granted to Lummy HK an exclusive license under the Arcelis technology, including patents, know-how and improvements
to manufacture, develop and commercialize products for the treatment of cancer ( Licensed Product ) in China, Hong
Kong, Taiwan and Macau (the  Territory ). Under the License Agreement, Lummy HK also has a right of first negotiation
with respect to a license under the Arcelis technology for the treatment of infectious diseases in the Territory. 

Under the terms of the License Agreement, the parties will share
relevant data, and the Company will have a right to reference Lummy HK data for purposes of its development programs under the
Arcelis technology. In addition, Lummy HK has granted to the Company an exclusive, royalty-free license under and to any and all
Lummy HK improvements to the Arcelis technology conceived or reduced to practice by Lummy HK ( Lummy HK Improvements )
and Lummy HK data to develop and/or commercialize products ( Arcelis-Based Products ) outside the Territory, an exclusive,
royalty-free license under and to any and all investigational new drug applications ( INDs ) and other regulatory approvals
and Lummy HK trademarks used for an Arcelis-Based Product to develop and/or commercialize an Arcelis-Based Product outside the
Territory and a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under any Lummy HK Improvements and Lummy HK data to manufacture
Arcelis-Based Products anywhere in the world. Lummy HK has the right to reference the Company s data, INDs and other regulatory
filings and submissions for the purpose of developing and obtaining regulatory approval of Licensed Products in the Territory. 

Pursuant to the License Agreement, Lummy HK will pay the Company royalties on net sales
and up to an aggregate of $20.0 million upon the achievement of manufacturing, regulatory and commercial milestones. The License
Agreement will terminate upon expiration of the last to expire royalty term for all Arcelis-Based Products, with each royalty term
being the longer of the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the applicable Arcelis-Based Product and 10 years from
the first commercial sale of such Arcelis-Based Product. Either party may terminate the License Agreement for the other party s
uncured material breach or if specified conditions occur relating to the other party s insolvency or bankruptcy. The
Company may terminate the License Agreement if Lummy HK challenges or assists a third party in challenging specified patent rights
of the Company. If Lummy HK terminates the License Agreement upon the Company s material breach or bankruptcy, Lummy HK is
entitled to terminate the licenses it granted to the Company and retain its licenses from the Company with respect to Arcelis-Based
Products then in development or being commercialized, subject to Lummy HK s continued obligation to pay royalties and milestones
with respect to such Arcelis-Based Products. 

12. Net Loss Per Share  

Basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock was determined by dividing net loss
by the weighted average of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company s potentially dilutive shares,
which include options to purchase common stock and warrants, have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per
share for all periods as the result would be antidilutive. 

The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share
of common stock: 

The following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation
of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as they would be antidilutive: 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations  

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing in  Item
1. Financial Statements  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical information, some of the information
contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with
respect to our plans and strategy for our business, future financial performance, expense levels and liquidity sources, includes
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results
described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.  

Overview  

We are an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of
individualized immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases based on our proprietary technology platform
called Arcelis. 

Our most advanced product candidate is AGS-003, which we are developing for the treatment
of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or mRCC, and other cancers. We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of
AGS-003 plus sunitinib or another targeted therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed mRCC under a special protocol assessment,
or SPA, with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We refer to this trial as the ADAPT trial. We opened the ADAPT trial for
enrollment in January 2013, dosed the first patient in May 2013 and completed enrollment of the trial in July 2015. Based upon
the actual rate of enrollment and projected event rate as defined in the protocol, we anticipate having a sufficient number of
events to permit the primary analysis and assessment of overall survival to occur in the first half of 2017. In June 2016, the
independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, for the ADAPT trial recommended that the ADAPT trial continue based on results
of the IDMC s scheduled interim data review. We expect that the next IDMC meeting will occur in connection with the Genitourinary
Cancers Symposium in February 2017. We are also supporting investigator-initiated Phase 2 trials in patients with early stage RCC
and non-small cell lung cancer and plan to support investigator-initiated trials of AGS-003 in muscle invasive bladder cancer and
in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in mRCC. 

We are developing AGS-004, our second most advanced Arcelis-based
product candidate, for the treatment of HIV. We have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials funded by government grants and a Phase
2b trial that was funded in full by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, or NIAID, under a $39.8 million agreement. We are currently supporting an ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trial
of AGS-004 in adult HIV patients evaluating the use of AGS-004 in combination with vorinostat, a latency reversing drug for HIV
eradication, and plan to support an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 evaluating AGS-004 for long-term viral
control in pediatric patients provided that results from our ongoing trial in adult HIV patients are favorable. 

We have devoted substantially all of our resources to our drug development efforts, including
advancing our Arcelis platform, conducting clinical trials of our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and
providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and, to
date, have funded our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock and warrants, a venture loan, private placements
of common stock, preferred stock and warrants, convertible debt financings, government contracts, government and other third party
grants and license and collaboration agreements. From inception in May 1997 through September 30, 2016, we have raised a total
of $494.4 million in cash, including: 

$331.6 million from the sale of our common stock, convertible debt, warrants and preferred stock;   

$32.9 million from the licensing of our technology;   

$104.9 million from government contracts, grants and license and collaboration agreements; and   

$25.0 million from our venture loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Horizon Technology Finance Corporation and Fortress Credit Co LLC, or the Lenders.   

On August 2, 2016, we issued and sold 9,090,909 shares of common stock and warrants to
purchase an aggregate of 6,818,181 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $5.50
per share and accompanying warrant. The shares of common stock and warrants were sold in combination, with one warrant to purchase
up to 0.75 of a share of common stock accompanying each share of common stock sold. The warrants have an exercise price of $5.50
per share, became immediately exercisable upon issuance and will expire on August 2, 2021. The aggregate net proceeds to us of
the offering were approximately $48.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 

We have incurred losses in each year since our inception in May 1997. Our net loss was
$53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $37.7 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $316.6 million. Substantially
all of our operating losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our development programs and from general and
administrative costs associated with our operations. 

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for
at least the next several years. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we: 

continue our ongoing ADAPT trial of AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC;   

continue to support ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004;   

support planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004;   

initiate and conduct additional clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004 for the treatment of cancers and HIV;   

seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;   

lease, build out and equip a facility or otherwise arrange for the
    commercial manufacture of our products based on our Arcelis platform;   

establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;   

maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;   

continue our other research and development efforts;   

hire additional clinical, quality control, scientific and management personnel; and   

add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned commercialization efforts.   

We have no external sources of funds other than our contract with the NIH and NIAID (as
described below). We do not expect to generate significant additional funds or product revenue unless and until we successfully
complete development, obtain marketing approval and commercialize our product candidates, either alone or in collaboration with
third parties, which we expect will take a number of years and is subject to significant uncertainty. Accordingly, we will need
to raise additional capital prior to the commercialization of AGS-003, AGS-004 or any of our other product candidates. Until such
time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination
of equity offerings, debt financings, government contracts, government and other third party grants or other third party funding,
marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. However, we may
be unable to raise additional funds through these means when needed, on favorable terms or at all. 

NIH Funding   

In September 2006, we entered into a multi-year research contract with the NIH and NIAID
to design, develop and clinically test an autologous HIV immunotherapy capable of eliciting therapeutic immune responses. We have
used funds from this contract to develop AGS-004, including to fund in full our Phase 2b clinical trial of AGS-004. On June 29,
2016, a contract modification was agreed to that extended the NIH and NIAID s commitment under the contract to July 31, 2018.
We have agreed to a statement of work under the contract, and are obligated to furnish all the services, qualified personnel, material,
equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the U.S. government needed to perform the statement of work. 

Under this contract, as amended, the NIH and NIAID have committed
to fund up to a total of $39.8 million, including reimbursement of direct expenses and allocated overhead and general and administrative
expenses of up to $38.4 million and payment of other specified amounts totaling up to $1.4 million upon our achievement of specified
development milestones. This amount includes a September 2014 modification of the contract under which the NIH and NIAID agreed
to fund up to an additional $500,000 to cover a portion of the manufacturing costs of the planned Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004
for long-term viral control in pediatric patients. Since September 2010, we have received reimbursement of our allocated overhead
and general and administrative expenses at provisional indirect cost rates equal to negotiated provisional indirect cost rates
agreed to with the NIH and NIAID in September 2010. These provisional indirect cost rates are subject to adjustment based on our
actual costs pursuant to the agreement with the NIH and NIAID and may result in additional payments to us from the NIH and NIAID
to reflect our actual costs since September 2010. 

We have recorded revenue of $37.8 million through September 30, 2016 under the NIH
and NIAID contract. This contract is the only arrangement under which we have generated substantial revenue. As of September 30,
2016, there was up to $2.0 million of potential revenue remaining to be earned under the agreement with the NIH and NIAID.

We hold all commercial rights to AGS-003 and AGS-004 in all
geographies other than rights to AGS-003 in Russia and the other states comprising the Commonwealth of Independent States, which
we exclusively licensed to Pharmstandard International S.A., or Pharmstandard, rights to AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC in South
Korea, which we exclusively licensed to Green Cross Corp., or Green Cross, and rights to AGS-003 in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Macau, which we exclusively licensed to Lummy (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd., or Lummy HK. We have granted to MEDcell Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Medinet Co. Ltd., hereinafter referred to together as  Medinet,  an exclusive license to manufacture
in Japan AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC. 

AGS-003   

We are developing AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC and other cancers. We are currently
conducting the ADAPT trial of AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed mRCC, versus sunitinib/targeted
therapy alone, in a protocol developed under an SPA with the FDA. We opened the ADAPT trial for enrollment in January 2013 and
dosed the first patient in May 2013. In July 2015 we completed enrollment in the trial, enrolling 462 patients with the goal of
generating 290 events for the primary endpoint of overall survival. We enrolled these patients at 107 clinical sites in North America,
Europe and Israel. Under the trial protocol, these patients were randomized between the AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy
combination arm and the sunitinib / targeted therapy alone control arm on a two-to-one basis. In June 2016, the IDMC for the ADAPT
trial recommended that the ADAPT trial continue based on results of the IDMC s scheduled interim data review. We expect that
the next IDMC meeting will occur in connection with the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2017. Based on internal projections,
we believe that we have reached more than half of the targeted number of events for the ADAPT trial s overall survival primary
endpoint. Based upon the actual rate of enrollment and the projected event rate as defined in the protocol, we anticipate having
a sufficient number of events to permit the primary analysis and assessment of overall survival to occur in the first half of 2017. 

In addition, in mRCC we plan to support an investigator-initiated clinical trial of AGS-003
in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor that we expect will open for enrollment in the first half of 2017. 

We are also supporting an ongoing investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial designed
to evaluate neoadjuvant treatment with AGS-003 in patients with early stage, localized RCC prior to nephrectomy. This trial was
opened for enrollment in late 2014 and four patients were enrolled as of September 30, 2016. We expect that a total of 10 patients
will be enrolled in this trial. This trial provides the opportunity to observe the impact of AGS-003 on the immune response in
both the peripheral blood and in the primary tumor that is removed after AGS-003 treatment, the latter as evidenced by the presence
of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor. 

We believe that AGS-003 may be capable of treating a wide range of cancers and are planning
to evaluate AGS-003 in clinical trials in additional cancer indications. We are supporting an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical
trial of AGS-003 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, that was opened for enrollment in the first quarter of
2016. In the trial, the safety, efficacy and immunologic effects of AGS-003 when combined with platinum-based chemotherapy and
radiation will be evaluated in approximately 20 NSCLC patients. In the trial, AGS-003 will be administered either concurrently
with chemotherapy and with or without radiation, or sequentially with chemotherapy and with or without radiation, according to
the patient s assigned treatment arm. We are conducting this trial in NSCLC patients because NSCLC is a tumor type reported
to have a high number of mutated targets for the immune system, which could make it more susceptible to AGS-003 s mechanism
of action. We also believe platinum-based chemotherapy has immunomodulatory effects by downregulating immunosuppressive regulatory
T-cells which may lead to an additive or synergistic effect with AGS-003. 

We also plan to support an additional investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of
AGS-003 in muscle invasive bladder cancer, which we expect to open for enrollment by the end of 2016. The trial has two phases:
a pre-treatment phase and a treatment phase. In the pre-treatment phase, tumor tissue will be obtained via a transurethral resection
of the bladder tumor, which will then be used to extract RNA for the manufacture of AGS-003. In the treatment phase, AGS-003 will
be given before tumor resection and combined with standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy, consisting of cisplatin and gemcitabine.
Booster doses of AGS-003 will continue after tumor resection. As with the neoadjuvant RCC trial, we expect that the trial will
provide us with the opportunity to observe the impact of AGS-003 on the immune response in both the peripheral blood and the primary
tumor, the latter as evidenced by the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor. 

AGS-004   

We are developing AGS-004 for the treatment of HIV and are focusing this program on the
use of AGS-004 in combination with other therapies for the eradication of HIV. We believe that by combining AGS-004 with therapies
that are being developed to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system, we can potentially eradicate the
virus. The current standard-of-care, antiretroviral drug therapy, or ART, can reduce levels of HIV in a patient s blood,
increase the patient s life expectancy and improve the patient s quality of life. However, ART cannot eliminate the
virus, which persists in latently infected cells, where it remains undetectable by the immune system and can lead to disease recurrence.
In addition, ART requires daily, life-long treatment which can have significant side effects and impact patients  quality
of life. 

We are supporting an investigator-initiated clinical trial of AGS-004 in adult HIV patients
to evaluate the use of AGS-004 in combination with the latency reversing drug vorinostat for the eradication of HIV at the University
of North Carolina. Vorinostat is marketed under the name Zolinza by Merck   Co. Inc. for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma. This trial is being conducted in two stages. Stage 1 of this trial, which was designed to study immune response kinetics
to AGS-004 in patients on continuous ART, has been completed. Data from Stage 1 were used to better define the optimal dosing strategy
for the combination of AGS-004 and vorinostat in the ongoing Stage 2 phase of this trial. We expect that up to 12 adult HIV patients
will be studied in Stage 2. These patients will receive alternating courses of AGS-004 and vorinostat, and will continue ART throughout
the study. In July 2016, the first patient in Stage 2 was dosed. The patient clinical costs for the first stage of this trial
were funded by Collaboratory of AIDS Researchers for Eradication, or CARE. The second stage of the trial is being funded by a federal
research grant from the Division of AIDS of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH. 

We also plan to explore the use of AGS-004 monotherapy to provide long-term control
of HIV viral load in otherwise immunologically healthy patients and eliminate their need for ART. Accordingly, if initial data
from stage 2 of the ongoing adult eradication study are favorable, we plan to support an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical
trial of AGS-004 monotherapy in pediatric patients infected with HIV who have otherwise healthy immune systems and have been treated
with ART since birth or shortly thereafter and, as a result, are lacking the antiviral memory T-cells to combat the virus. The
commencement of this trial is subject to approval of the protocol by the principal investigator(s), institutional review boards,
the IMPAACT Network leadership and the FDA and to the agreement by the NIH to fund the trial costs not related to AGS-004 manufacturing.
Assuming the supportive data and the necessary approvals are obtained, we expect this trial to open in 2017. 

Manufacturing   

We currently have manufacturing suites in our facility located at our corporate headquarters
in Durham, North Carolina. We manufacture our Arcelis-based product candidates for research and development purposes and for clinical
trials at this facility. In August 2014, we entered into a ten-year lease agreement with renewal options with the developer, TKC
LXXII, LLC, or TKC. Under the lease agreement, we agreed to lease certain land and an approximately 125,000 square-foot building
to be constructed in Durham County, North Carolina, which we refer to as Centerpoint. We intended this facility to house our corporate
headquarters and commercial manufacturing. The shell of the new facility was constructed on a build-to-suit basis in accordance
with agreed upon specifications and plans and was completed in June 2015. However, the build-out and equipping of the interior
of the facility has not been completed as we explore potential financing arrangements. 

Under the lease agreement, we had an option to purchase the property. In February 2015,
we exercised this purchase option and entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with TKC. The purchase price to be paid by us
was $7.4 million plus the amount of any additional costs incurred by TKC as a result of changes requested by us, for which we had
paid $1.7 million as of September 30, 2016, and the amount of any improvement allowances advanced to us by TKC prior to the closing.
Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we had until October 31, 2016 to consummate the purchase of the property. We
did not purchase the property by such date. As a result, we have no further right to purchase the property and will remain subject
to the lease under the Lease Agreement. 

We continue to explore financing arrangements which could enable
us to seek to purchase the Centerpoint facility if the landlord is willing to sell the property to us. We are also exploring other
alternatives for the commercial supply of our products. These alternatives include both internal manufacturing solutions as well
as potential contractual arrangements with contract manufacturing organizations. We expect that we will enter into arrangements
for the commercial manufacture of our products during the fourth quarter of 2016. Under either the Centerpoint option or one of
the alternatives, we expect that it would take approximately nine to 12 months to complete the build-out and equipping of a commercial
manufacturing facility and that such arrangements would likely involve material obligations. However, other than with respect to
our lease with TKC for Centerpoint, we have not entered into any binding arrangement with any party with respect to the lease,
build-out and equipping of a manufacturing facility or other arrangements for commercial manufacturing .
There can be no assurance that we will enter into arrangements on the terms previously available to us, on a timely basis or at
all.  

We plan to establish manual and automated manufacturing processes
in the commercial manufacturing facility. However, we have determined to delay the implementation of our automated manufacturing
process until after commercialization of AGS-003, and thus plan to seek marketing approval of AGS-003 and, if approved, to initially
commercially supply AGS-003 using our manual manufacturing process. Prior to implementing commercial manufacturing of AGS-003,
we will be required to demonstrate that the commercial manufacturing facility is constructed and operated in accordance with current
good manufacturing practice. We will also be required to show the comparability between AGS-003 that we produce using the manual
processes in our current facility and AGS-003 produced using the manual process in the new facility.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   

The following table summarizes the results of our operations for
each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, together with the changes in those items in dollars
and as a percentage: 

_______________

Revenue   

To date, we have not generated revenue from the sale of any products. Substantially all
of our revenue has been derived from our NIH and NIAID contract. We may generate revenue in the future from government
contracts and grants, payments from future license or collaboration agreements and product sales. We expect that any revenue we
generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. 

Revenue was $158,349 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared with
$146,756 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $11,593, or 7.3%. Revenue was $444,511 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, compared with $781,828 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of
$337,317, or 75.9%. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulted from higher reimbursement under our NIH
and NIAID contract in the respective 2016 period and was primarily related to the achievement of certain specified development
milestones during 2016. 

Research and Development Expenses   

Since our inception, we have focused our resources on our research and development activities,
including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory
filings for our product candidates. We recognize our research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development
expenses consist primarily of: 

salaries and related expenses for personnel in research and development functions;   

fees paid to consultants and clinical research organizations, or CROs, including in connection with our clinical trials, and other related clinical trial fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis;   

commercial manufacturing development consisting of costs incurred under our development agreement with Invetech Pty Ltd, or Invetech, under which Invetech has agreed to develop and provide prototypes of the automated production system to be used for the manufacture of our Arcelis-based products;   

allocation of facility lease and maintenance costs;   

costs incurred under our development agreement with Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, or Saint-Gobain, to develop a range of disposables for use in the automated production system;   

depreciation of leasehold improvements, laboratory equipment and computers;   

costs related to production of product candidates for clinical trials;   

costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements;   

consulting fees paid to third parties related to non-clinical research and development;   

costs related to stock options or other stock-based compensation granted to personnel in research and development functions; and   

acquisition fees, license fees and milestone payments related to acquired and in-licensed technologies.   

The table below summarizes our direct research and development
expenses by program for the periods indicated. Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs,
such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs, including in connection with our clinical trials,
and related clinical trial fees. Research and development expenses also include commercial manufacturing development costs consisting
primarily of costs incurred under our development agreements with Invetech and Saint-Gobain to develop and provide prototypes of
the automated production system to be used for the manufacture of our Arcelis-based products. We have been developing AGS-003 and
AGS-00, in parallel, and typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs.
We do not allocate salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefit or other indirect costs related to our research and development
function to specific product candidates. Those expenses are included in  Indirect research and development expense 
in the table below. 

Three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016.  
Research and development expenses were $17.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared with $9.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $7.9 million, or 45.8%. The decrease in research and development
expense reflects a $2.9 million decrease in direct research and development expense, a $4.3 million decrease in commercial manufacturing
development expense and a $0.7 million decrease in indirect research and development expense. 

The $2.9 million decrease in direct research and development
expenses resulted primarily from the following: 

Direct research and development expense for AGS-003 decreased from $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $2.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease primarily reflects the completion of patient enrollment in the ongoing ADAPT trial of AGS-003 in July 2015. Significant expenses are incurred to obtain patient enrollment and then the ongoing monitoring costs generally decline as the trial progresses.   

Direct research and development expense with respect to AGS-004 was not significantly different in the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2016.   

The $4.3 million decrease in commercial manufacturing development
expense resulted primarily from our decision to significantly reduce our spending and activity related to the automated manufacturing
process. We commenced our commercial manufacturing development efforts during 2014 and such activity increased progressively through
the end of 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we significantly reduced our spending and activity for commercial manufacturing
development, which resulted in the decrease in such expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the
three months ended September 30, 2015. 

The $0.7 million decrease in indirect research and development
expense was primarily due to lower personnel costs, as we had 111 employees engaged in research and development activities as of
September 30, 2015 compared with 96 employees as of September 30, 2016. 

Nine Months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 . 
Research and development expenses were $48.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared with $28.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $20.1 million, or 41.7%. The decrease in research and development
expense reflects an $8.4 million decrease in direct research and development expense, a $13.6 million decrease in commercial manufacturing
development expense and a $1.9 million increase in indirect research and development expense. 

The $8.4 million decrease in direct research and development
expenses resulted primarily from the following: 

Direct research and development expense with respect to AGS-004 was not significantly different in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   

The $13.6 million decrease in research and development expense
related to our commercial manufacturing development efforts reflect our determination during the fourth quarter of 2015 to significantly
reduce our spending and activity related to the automated manufacturing process. 

The $1.9 million increase in indirect research and development expense was partially
due to higher personnel costs of $1.4 million as we had 111 employees engaged in research and development activities as of September 30,
2015 compared with 118 employees as of the beginning of the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the termination costs associated
with our April 2016 reduction in force. Termination costs including severance and the partial acceleration of certain stock options
for these employees totaled $1.2 million of the $1.4 million increase in personnel costs. Additionally, occupancy costs were $0.5
million higher in the 2016 period primarily due to rent incurred under the TKC lease agreement and higher depreciation. 

The successful development of our clinical and preclinical product candidates is highly
uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete
the remainder of the development of any of our clinical or preclinical product candidates or the period, if any, in which material
net cash inflows from these product candidates may commence. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with
developing drugs, including the uncertainty of: 

the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our ongoing clinical trials;   

the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of additional clinical trials that we may conduct;   

the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our commercial manufacturing development efforts;   

other research and development activities; and   

the timing of regulatory approvals.   

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of
a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate.
For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently
anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays
in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time
on the completion of clinical development. 

General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for
employees in executive, operational and finance, information technology and human resources functions. Other significant general
and administrative expenses include allocation of facilities costs, professional fees for accounting and legal services and expenses
associated with obtaining and maintaining patents. 

General and administrative expenses were $2.7 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, compared with $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase
of $0.3 million or 11.9%. This increase was primarily due to an additional $0.2 million in personnel costs, including salaries,
benefits and stock-based compensation and $0.1 million of occupancy expenses and additional outside services resulting from legal
fees. 

General and administrative expenses were $8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015, compared with $9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1.4 million or 17.6%. This
increase was primarily due to an additional $0.9 million in personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation,
$0.1 million of additional consulting costs resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP system,
$0.3 million of additional outside services resulting primarily from legal fees and an increase of $0.1 million in occupancy expenses. 

We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase with the continued
development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. 

Interest Expense   

Interest expense was $0.3 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, compared with $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Total interest cost during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.0 million. Of this amount, $0.5 million was capitalized as construction-in-progress
resulting in interest expense of $0.4 million during the period. Total interest cost during the three months ended September 30,
2015 was $0.9 million. Of this amount, $0.5 million was capitalized as construction-in-progress resulting in interest expense of
$0.3 million during the period. Accordingly, interest expense increased by $0.1 million during the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The increase in total interest cost for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily resulted from higher outstanding indebtedness borrowed under
the Loan Agreement. 

Interest expense was $1.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, compared with $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Total interest cost during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.9 million. Of this amount, $1.4 million was capitalized as construction-in-progress
resulting in interest expense of $1.5 million during the period. Total interest cost during the nine months ended September 30,
2015 was $2.2 million. Of this amount, $0.5 million was capitalized as construction-in-progress resulting in interest expense of
$1.6 million during the period. Accordingly, interest expense decreased by $0.2 million during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The increase in total interest cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily resulted from higher outstanding indebtedness borrowed under the
Loan Agreement. 

We expect that interest expense will increase as a result of interest
incurred under the Loan Agreement.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Sources of Liquidity   

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $69.3
million. 

Since our inception in May 1997 through September 30, 2016, we have funded our operations
principally with $331.6 million from the sale of common stock, convertible debt, warrants and preferred stock, $32.9 million from
the licensing of our technology, $104.9 million from government contracts, grants and license and collaboration agreements, and
$25.0 million from the Loan Agreement. 

Venture Loan and Security Agreement.  In September 2014, we entered into the Loan
Agreement with the Lenders, under which we could borrow up to $25.0 million in two tranches of $12.5 million each. 

We borrowed the first tranche of $12.5 million upon the closing of the loan facility
in September 2014 and borrowed the second tranche of $12.5 million in August 2015 following completion of enrollment of the ADAPT
trial. The per annum interest rate for each tranche is a floating rate equal to 9.25% plus the amount by which the one-month
LIBOR exceeds 0.50% (effectively a floating rate equal to 8.75% plus the one-month LIBOR Rate). The total per annum interest
rate shall not exceed 10.75%. 

We made payments with respect to the first tranche of $12.5
million on an interest-only basis monthly through October 31, 2016, and are currently making monthly payments of principal and
accrued interest through the scheduled maturity date for the first tranche loan on September 30, 2018. In addition, a final payment
for the first tranche loan equal to $625,000 will be due on September 30, 2018, or such earlier date specified in the Loan Agreement. We
have agreed to repay the second tranche of $12.5 million in 18 monthly payments of interest only until February 7, 2017, followed
by 24 monthly payments of principal and accrued interest through the scheduled maturity date for the second tranche loan on February
7, 2019. In addition, a final payment of $625,000 will be due on February 7, 2019, or such earlier date specified in the Loan
Agreement. In addition, we have agreed that if we repay all or a portion of the loan prior to the applicable maturity date,
we will pay the Lenders a prepayment penalty fee, based on a percentage of the then outstanding principal balance, equal to 3%
if the prepayment occurs on or before 24 months after the funding date thereof, 2% if the prepayment occurs more than 24 months
after, but on or before 36 months after, the funding date thereof, or 1% if the prepayment occurs more than 36 months after the
funding date thereof. 

Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest
in substantially all of our assets other than our intellectual property. We also have agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber
our intellectual property assets, subject to certain exceptions. 

The Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, but does
not include any covenants to attain or maintain certain financial metrics, and also includes customary events of default, including
payment defaults, breaches of covenants, change of control and a material adverse change default. Upon the occurrence of an
event of default and following any applicable cure periods, a default interest rate of an additional 5% may be applied to the outstanding
loan balances, and the Lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions
as set forth in the Loan Agreement. 

In connection with the Loan Agreement, we issued to the Lenders and their affiliates
warrants to purchase a total of 82,780 shares of our common stock at a per share exercise price of $9.06. Upon our satisfaction
of the conditions precedent to the making of the second tranche loan, the warrants became exercisable in full. The warrants
will terminate on September 29, 2021 or such earlier date as specified in the warrants.  

Commercial Manufacturing Facility.  In August 2014, we entered into the Lease
Agreement with TKC. Under the Lease Agreement, we agreed to lease certain land and an approximately 125,000 square-foot building
to be constructed in Durham County, North Carolina. We intended this facility to be built to house our corporate headquarters and
primary manufacturing facility. The lease for the current facility expires in November 2017. The shell of the new facility was
constructed on a build-to-suit basis by TKC in accordance with agreed upon specifications and plans as set forth in the Lease Agreement
and at the expense of TKC, other than those costs resulting from changes requested by us for which we have paid $1.7 million as
of September 30, 2016. 

The initial term of the Lease Agreement is 10 years from
the commencement date of July 1, 2015. We have the option to extend the Lease Agreement by six five-year renewal terms. Current
rent payments in the second year are $47,972 per month, subject to certain fixed increases over the course of the term as set forth
in the Lease Agreement. 

Under the Lease Agreement, we had an option to purchase the property. In February
2015, we exercised this purchase option and entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with TKC. The purchase price
to be paid by us was $7.4 million plus the amount of any additional costs incurred by TKC as a result of changes requested
by us, for which we have paid $1.7 million as of September 30, 2016, and the amount of any improvement allowances advanced
to us by TKC prior to the closing. Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we had until October 31, 2016 to consummate
the purchase of the property. We did not purchase the property by such date. As a result, we have no further right to purchase
the property and will remain subject to the lease under the Lease Agreement. 

Lummy License Agreement.  On April 7, 2015, we and Lummy HK entered into a license
agreement, or the License Agreement, whereby we granted to Lummy HK an exclusive license to our Arcelis technology, including patents,
know-how and improvements to manufacture, develop and commercialize products for the treatment of cancer in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan
and Macau. 

In connection with the License Agreement, we entered into stock purchase agreements with
Tianyi Lummy and China BioPharma of which Lummy HK s parent company is an affiliate and limited partner, respectively.  Pursuant
to the purchase agreements, the purchasers purchased an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at a per share price
of $10.11, or approximately $10.1 million. The purchasers also agreed to purchase approximately $10.0 million in additional shares
of our common stock, for a total aggregate investment of approximately $20 million, within 31 days of and subject to reaching full
enrollment of our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC, receiving a recommendation of the review board for the continuation
of our ADAPT trial following 50% of events and receiving positive feedback from the FDA on a qualified protocol to demonstrate
comparability of our automated manufacturing process for AGS-003 to the manufacturing process used by us in our ADAPT trial. However,
in March 2016, in connection with the agreement by Tianyi Lummy and China BioPharma to purchase approximately $10 million of shares
of our common stock and warrants in our private placement financing described below, we agreed they would have no further obligation
to purchase shares pursuant to the purchase agreements. 

PIPE Financing.  On March 4, 2016, we entered into
a securities purchase agreement with certain investors pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of up to $60
million of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock in a private placement financing. The financing was
to take place in up to three tranches. At the closing of the initial tranche in March 2016, we sold and the investors purchased,
for a total purchase price of approximately $19.9 million, a total of 3,652,430 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase
a total of 2,739,323 shares of common stock (0.75 shares of common stock for each share of common stock purchased), based on a
purchase price per share of common stock and accompanying warrant equal to $5.44375. At the closing of the second tranche
in June 2016, we sold and the investors purchased, for a total purchase price of approximately $29.8 million, a total of 5,478,672
shares of common stock and warrants to purchase a total of 4,109,005 shares of common stock at the same price and on the same terms
as the first tranche. The warrants issued in each closing have an exercise price of $5.35 per share and expire five years from
the date of issuance. Our stockholder, Pharmstandard International S.A., or Pharmstandard, had also agreed pursuant to the
securities purchase agreement that, at our option following the satisfaction of certain conditions, Pharmstandard could be required
to purchase at a third closing up to approximately $10.3 million of shares of common stock (without warrants). The dollar
amount committed to be purchased by Pharmstandard at the third closing was subject to reduction on a dollar-for-dollar basis for
certain cash amounts raised by us after the initial closing through equity or debt financings or collaborations.  The net
proceeds received from the follow-on public offering that closed on August 2, 2016 reduced in full the dollar amount committed
to be purchased in the third tranche (see Item 1. Note 8 to the Financial Statements), and as a result we have no further ability
to effect the closing of, and Pharmstandard has no further obligation to purchase shares in, a third tranche of the private placement
financing. 

In connection with entering into the securities purchase agreement, we entered into a
registration rights agreement with the investors pursuant to which we agreed to register for resale the shares issued in the financing
and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in the financing. 

At-the-market Offering.  In May 2015, we entered into a sales agreement, or the
Sales Agreement, with Cowen   Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from
time to time having an aggregate offering price of up to $30 million through Cowen, acting as our agent. Sales of our common stock
through Cowen may be made by any method permitted that is deemed an  at the market offering  as defined in Rule 415
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through the Nasdaq Global Market, sales made
to or through a market maker other than on an exchange or otherwise, in negotiated transactions at market prices, and/or any other
method permitted by law. Cowen is not required to sell any specific amount, but acts as our sales agent using commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices. Shares sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement have been sold pursuant
to a shelf registration statement, which became effective on May 14, 2015. Under the Sales Agreement, we pay Cowen a commission
of up to 3% of the gross proceeds. As of November 7, 2016, we had sold 872,682 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement,
resulting in proceeds of $5.5 million, net of commissions and issuance costs. 

Follow-On Public Offering.  On August 2, 2016, we issued and sold 9,090,909 shares
of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,818,181 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at
a price to the public of $5.50 per share and accompanying warrant. The shares of common stock and warrants were sold in combination,
with one warrant to purchase up to 0.75 of a share of common stock accompanying each share of common stock sold. The warrants have
an exercise price of $5.50 per share, became immediately exercisable upon issuance and will expire on August 2, 2021. The aggregate
net proceeds to us of the offering was approximately $48.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering
expenses. 

Cash Flows   

The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for the periods set
forth below: 

Operating Activities .  Net cash used in operating activities of $31.5 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily a result of our $37.7 million net loss, partially offset
by non-cash items of $4.4 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.8 million. The non-cash items primarily
reflect depreciation and amortization expense of $0.7 million, compensation expense related to stock options of $3.8 million, common
stock issued as payment for services of $0.2 million and amortization of debt discount of $0.1 million, partially offset by the
decrease or gain on the fair value of the warrant liability of $0.4 million. Accrued expenses increased by $2.3 million and the
manufacturing research and development obligation increased by $0.3 million, which increases were partially offset by a decrease
in accounts payable of $0.3 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other receivables of $0.4 million and a decrease in deferred
liabilities of $0.1 million. 

Net cash used in operating activities of $47.5 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 was primarily a result of our $57.2 million net loss, partially offset by non-cash items of $3.8 million
and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $6.0 million. These non-cash items primarily reflect depreciation and amortization
expense of $0.5 million, compensation expense related to stock options of $2.9 million, interest accrued on long-term debt of $0.1
million and $0.3 million of amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount. Accounts payable increased by $0.6 million,
accrued expenses increased by $3.1 million, long-term deferred liabilities increased by $2.3 million and the long-term portion
of our manufacturing research and development obligation increased by $1.3 million, which increases were partially offset by an
increase in other assets of $0.4 million and a decrease in long-term notes payable of $0.8 million. 

Investing Activities.   Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities
amounted to $8.9 million and ($9.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Cash provided
by and used in investing activities during each of these periods primarily reflected our purchases of property and equipment and
purchases, sales and maturities of short-term investments. Cash provided by investment activities during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 consisted of $18.7 million from maturities of short-term investments and a $0.6 million reduction in the restricted
cash account securing a letter of credit, partially offset by $2.7 million of purchases of short-term investments and $7.7 million
of purchases of property and equipment. Cash used in investment activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted
of $10.0 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds of $1.0 million from maturities of short-term
investments. 

Financing Activities.  Net cash provided by financing
activities amounted to $21.4 million and $103.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of $12.5 million of loan proceeds
from our Loan Agreement, proceeds of $8.6 million from the sale of common stock and $0.4 million of proceeds from the exercise
of stock options and from our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $30,711 of payments on notes payable. Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of proceeds of $105.2 million
from the issuance and sale of common stock and warrants under our private placement financing and our follow-on public offering
and from the issuance and sale of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. Additionally, cash provided by financing activities
also included $0.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock warrants, and $0.4 million of proceeds from the exercise
of stock options and from our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $2.2 million from the payment of stock issuance
costs and a $0.1 million payment on our facility lease obligation. 

Other Significant Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30,
2016 Compared with December 31, 2015   

Property and equipment, net, as of September 30, 2016 increased by $15.2 million from
December 31, 2015 primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in computer software recognized from the implementation of our new ERP
system and $12.8 million from construction-in-progress. Accounts payable and accrued expenses as of September 30, 2016 increased
by $4.4 million from December 31, 2015 primarily due to purchases of property and equipment. As of September 30, 2016, we also
recognized liabilities for capital lease obligations of $2.3 million and for warrants of $21.5 million. We did not have these liabilities
as of December 31, 2015. 

Funding Requirements  

To date, we have not generated any product revenue from our
development stage product candidates. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any product revenue. We do not expect to generate
significant product revenue unless or until we obtain marketing approval of, and commercialize, AGS-003 or AGS-004. At the same
time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our ADAPT trial
of AGS-003, initiate additional clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004, seek regulatory approval for our product candidates and
lease, build out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility or otherwise arrange for commercial manufacturing. In addition,
if we obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for
product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated
with operating as a public company. We will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. 

Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our cash
and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and the anticipated funding under our NIH and NIAID contract will enable us to fund
our operating expenses through the second quarter of 2017. We expect that our available funds will be sufficient to fund our
operations until such time as there are a sufficient number of events to permit the primary analysis and assessment of overall
survival in the ADAPT trial and to fund our share of the expected costs related to preparations for commercial manufacturing. 

We expect that these funds will not, however, be sufficient to enable us to complete
required activities in preparation for the submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA for AGS-003, to commercially
launch AGS-003 or to complete the build-out and equipping of a commercial manufacturing facility without entering into financing
arrangements related to the facility. These expectations are based on our current operating plan under which we implemented measures
to reduce our operating expenses, including reductions in spending for activities in preparation for submission of a BLA and a
workforce reduction action plan designed to streamline operations and reduce our operating expenses. We intend to seek to enter
into collaborations for the development, marketing and distribution of AGS-003 outside North America and of our non-oncology product
candidates, including AGS-004. If we are unable to enter into any such collaborations, we may be required to implement additional
measures to materially reduce our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business and operations. It is also possible
that our available funds will not enable us to reach a sufficient number of events to permit the primary analysis and assessment
of overall survival from the ADAPT trial because the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are difficult to predict and are
subject to substantial risks and delays. 

We continue to explore financing arrangements, which could enable
us to seek to purchase the Centerpoint facility if the landlord is willing to sell the property to us. We are also exploring other
alternatives for the commercial supply of our products. These alternatives include both internal manufacturing solutions as well
as potential contractual arrangements with contract manufacturing organizations. We expect that we will enter into arrangements
for the commercial manufacture of our products during the fourth quarter of 2016. Under either the Centerpoint option or one of
the alternatives, we expect that it will take approximately nine to 12 months to complete the build-out and equipping of a commercial
manufacturing facility and that such arrangements would likely involve material obligations. However, other than with respect to
our lease with TKC or Centerpoint, we have not entered into any binding arrangement with any party with respect to the lease, build-out
and equipping of a manufacturing facility. There can be no assurance that we will enter into arrangements on the terms previously
available to us, on a timely basis or at all. If we are unable to enter into financing arrangements on the terms we anticipate,
on a timely basis or at all, we may not be able to complete the planned leasing, build-out and equipping of a commercial facility,
or may be delayed in doing so, which in either case would delay the commercialization of AGS-003. 

We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use
our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with
the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays
and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of our product candidates. 

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

the progress and results of our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 and the ongoing and planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 that we support;   

the progress and results of the ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trial of AGS-004 in combination with vorinostat for HIV eradication and the planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-004 that we support and our ability to obtain additional funding under our NIH and NIAID contract for our AGS-004 program;   

the development, initiation and support of additional clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004 in mRCC or other indications;   

the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other product candidates;   

the costs and timing of our leasing, build-out and equipping of a commercial manufacturing facility or
of alternative arrangements for commercial manufacturing and any costs and liabilities associated with financing arrangements entered
into to fund the costs of these activities;

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;   

the costs of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval;   

the potential need to repay the $6.0 million in principal remaining outstanding under the loan under our license agreement with Medinet Co. Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MEDcell Co., Ltd, which we refer to together as Medinet;   

our ability to refinance our existing venture loan facility with the Lenders ;    

revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates be approved by the FDA or a similar regulatory authority outside the United States;   

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;   

the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies;   

our ability to obtain government or other third party funding for the development of our product candidates; and   

our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all, particularly arrangements to develop, market and distribute AGS-003 outside North America and arrangements for the development and commercialization of our non-oncology product candidates, including AGS-004.   

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to
finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government contracts, government and other third
party grants or other third party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances
and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities,
stockholder ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences
that adversely affect stockholder rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring
dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements
or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights
to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not
be favorable to us. 

We are seeking government or other third party funding for the continued development
of AGS-004. In January 2014, CARE agreed that it would fund all patient clinical costs of Stage 1 of our adult eradication clinical
trial of AGS-004, except for the associated manufacturing costs for which we were responsible. NIAID s Division of AIDS has
approved $6.6 million in funding for Stage 2 of this Phase 2 clinical trial to be provided directly to the University of North
Carolina. If we are unable to raise additional government or other third party funding when needed, we may be required to delay,
limit, reduce or terminate our development of AGS-004 or to grant rights to develop and market AGS-004 that we would otherwise
prefer to keep for ourselves. 

Critical Accounting Estimates  

Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation
of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the
reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We
base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to our financial
statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no significant changes
to our critical accounting policies discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Contractual Obligations  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no material changes outside
the ordinary course of our business to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, except for the new capital lease obligations discussed in Note 7 to our financial statements. In August
2016, we entered into two power generation agreements with an electric utility company. The power generation agreements are
being accounted for as capital leases for financial reporting purposes. 

Under the power generation agreements, the electric
utility company will design, procure, install, own and maintain equipment at Centerpoint to support mission critical
electrical loads. The power generation agreements require monthly payments totaling $41,185 for a period of 128 months, or a
total of $5.3 million ending in March 2027. As of September 30, 2016, future minimum payments due under these capital leases
within one-year total $0.5 million, within years one and three total $1.0 million, within years three and five total $1.0
million and thereafter totals $2.7 million. Property, plant and equipment includes $2.4 million under the power generation
agreements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

Our primary exposure to market risk is limited to our cash and cash equivalents, all
of which have maturities of one year or less. The related interest income sensitivity is affected by changes in the general level
of short-term U.S. interest rates. We primarily invest in high quality, short-term marketable debt securities issued by high quality
financial and industrial companies. 

Due to the short-term duration and low risk profile of our cash and cash equivalents,
an immediate 10.0% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our portfolio. Accordingly,
we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change
in market interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents. 

We do not believe that our cash and cash equivalents have significant risk of default
or illiquidity. However, while we believe our cash and cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute
assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in fair value. In addition, we maintain significant
amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. 

We are also exposed to market risk from the potential increase in short-term U.S. interest
rates under our Loan Agreement with Horizon and Fortress. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the per annum interest rate for each
tranche is a floating rate equal to 9.25% plus the amount by which the one-month LIBOR exceeds 0.50% (effectively a floating rate
equal to 8.75% plus the one-month LIBOR Rate). The total per annum interest rate shall not exceed 10.75%. Since the one-month
LIBOR Rate has been less than 0.50% since the Loan Agreement was executed in September 2014, our interest rate has been and is
currently 9.25%. If the one-month LIBOR Rate increases to 2.0% or greater, the interest expense we will incur under the Loan Agreement
will increase by $375,000 per year. 

All of our other debt instruments and liabilities that incur interest charges do so at
fixed rates. We incur interest expense at fixed rates under the unsecured promissory note payable to Medinet (3% per annum), the
manufacturing research and development obligations payable to Invetech (7% per annum), and other notes payable (8.31% per annum). 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2016. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))
under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30,
2016, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance levels. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

From time to time, we have been and may again become involved in legal proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any material litigation. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing business environment that involves multiple
risks and substantial uncertainty. The following discussion addresses risks and uncertainties that could cause, or contribute to
causing, actual results to differ from expectations in material ways. In evaluating our business, investors should pay particular
attention to the risks and uncertainties described below and in other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our
subsequent filings with the SEC. These risks and uncertainties, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we
currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The trading price of our
common stock could also decline due to any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.  

Risks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our
Product Candidates  

We depend heavily on the success of our two product candidates, AGS-003 and AGS-004,
both of which are still in clinical development. Clinical trials of our product candidates may not be successful. If we are unable
to commercialize our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.   

We currently have no products approved for sale. We have invested a significant portion
of our efforts and financial resources in the development of AGS-003 for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or mRCC,
and other cancers and AGS-004 for the treatment of HIV. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur
for at least the next several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization
of these product candidates. The success of these product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following: 

successful completion of clinical trials, including clinical results that are statistically significant as well as clinically meaningful in the context of the indications for which we are developing our product candidates;   

receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;   

establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities through the lease, build-out and equipping of a facility
or through arrangements with a contract manufacturing organization for the commercial manufacture of products based on our Arcelis
platform;  

maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates, both in the United States and internationally;   

launching commercial sales of the products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;   

commercial acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third party payors;   

obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement;   

effectively competing with other therapies; and   

a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following any marketing approval.   

If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could
experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm
our business. 

If clinical trials of our product candidates, such as our ADAPT trial of AGS-003,
fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States
or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be
unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.   

Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must
conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing
is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one
or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials
may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict
final results. For instance, despite observing positive results in earlier clinical trials of AGS-004, we failed to achieve the
primary endpoint of our Phase 2b clinical trial of AGS-004. Similarly, recommendations of the independent data monitoring committee
that the ADAPT trial should be continued based on results of the committee s interim data analyses of interim trial results
may not be indicative as to the final results of the trial. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying
interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical
studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. 

In particular, to date, we have not completed a randomized clinical trial of AGS-003
against a placebo or a comparator therapy. While we believe comparisons to results from other reported clinical trials or from
analyses of data from the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium, or the Consortium, can assist in evaluating
the potential efficacy of our AGS-003 product candidate, there are many factors that affect the outcome for patients, some of which
are not apparent in published reports. As a result, results from two different trials or between a trial and an analysis of a treatment
database often cannot be reliably compared. Our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 is intended to compare directly the combination of AGS-003
and sunitinib or another targeted therapy to treatment with sunitinib or another targeted therapy monotherapy. Based on the design
of the trial, the data from the trial will need to demonstrate an increase in median overall survival of approximately six months
for the AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy arm as compared to the sunitinib / targeted therapy monotherapy control arm in
order to show statistical significance and achieve the primary endpoint of the trial. We will need to show this statistically significant
benefit of the combined therapy as compared to treatment with the sunitinib / targeted therapy monotherapy as part of a biologics
license application, or BLA, submission for approval of AGS-003. However, demonstration of statistical significance and achievement
of the primary endpoint of the trial do not assure approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. 

Patients in our ADAPT trial who receive treatment with sunitinib / targeted therapy
monotherapy may not have results similar to patients studied in other clinical trials of sunitinib or to patients in the Consortium
database who were treated with sunitinib or other targeted therapies. If the patients in our ADAPT trial who receive sunitinib
/ targeted therapy alone have results which are better than the results that occurred in those other clinical trials or the results
described in the Consortium database, we may not demonstrate a sufficient clinical benefit from AGS-003 in combination with sunitinib
and other targeted therapies to allow the FDA to approve AGS-003 for marketing. In addition, only 21 evaluable patients received
the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib in our single arm Phase 2 clinical trial. If the patients in our ADAPT trial who receive
the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib / targeted therapy have results which are worse than the results that occurred in our
Phase 2 clinical trial, we may not demonstrate a sufficient benefit from the combination therapy to allow the FDA to approve AGS-003
for marketing. 

For drug and biological products, the FDA typically requires the successful completion
of two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to support marketing approval because a conclusion based on two such trials
will be more reliable than a conclusion based on a single trial. In the case of AGS-003, which is intended for a life-threatening
disease, we intend to seek approval based upon the results of a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, our ADAPT trial. The FDA
reviewed our plans to conduct our ADAPT trial under its special protocol assessment, or SPA, process. In February 2013, the FDA
advised us in a letter that it had completed its review of our plans under the SPA process. The FDA also informed us that in order
for a single trial to support approval of an indication, the trial must be well conducted, and the results of the trial must be
internally consistent, clinically meaningful and statistically very persuasive. If the results for the primary endpoint are not
robust, are subject to confounding factors, or are not adequately supported by other trial endpoints, the FDA may refuse to approve
our BLA based upon a single clinical trial. In addition, because only 21 evaluable patients received the combination of AGS-003
and sunitinib in our Phase 2 clinical trial, and as a result, we did not have enough evaluable patients to perform the statistical
analysis to determine whether the primary endpoint of complete response rate was achieved in that trial, we expect that the data
from our Phase 2 clinical trial will have only a limited impact on the FDA s ultimate assessment of efficacy of AGS-003.
Thus, there can be no guarantee that the FDA will not require additional pivotal clinical trials as a condition for approving
AGS-003 or as a post-approval requirement. 

If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product
candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product
candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there
are safety concerns, we may: 

be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;   

not obtain marketing approval at all;   

obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;   

obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;   

be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;   

be subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used; or   

have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.   

If we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events
in connection with our clinical trials, potential marketing or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or
prevented.   

We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials
that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates. For example, in
September 2011, the FDA placed the original protocol for our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 in combination with sunitinib on partial clinical
hold due to unresolved questions regarding the planned measurement of the secretion of the cytokine interleukin-12, or IL-12, as
part of the specifications for the release of AGS-003. We subsequently reached an agreement with the FDA regarding the IL-12 release
specifications and the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold. 

Unforeseen events that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval
or commercialize our product candidates include: 

regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;   

we may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;   

clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;   

the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; for example, in our Phase 2b clinical trial of AGS-004, we experienced a higher dropout rate than we anticipated due to the higher than expected number of patients who did not complete the full 12 week antiretroviral treatment interruption required by the protocol for the trial;   

our third party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;   

we may decide, or regulators or institutional review boards may require us or our investigators to, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;   

the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; and   

the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.   

In addition, the patients recruited for clinical trials of our product candidates may
have a disease profile or other characteristics that are different than we expect and different than the clinical trials were designed
for, which could adversely impact the results of the clinical trials. For instance, our Phase 2 combination therapy clinical trial
of AGS-003 in combination with sunitinib was originally designed to enroll patients with favorable disease risk profiles and intermediate
disease risk profiles and with a primary endpoint of complete response rate. However, the actual trial population consisted entirely
of patients with intermediate disease risk profiles and poor disease risk profiles. This is a population for which published research
has shown that sunitinib alone, as well as other of the targeted therapies for mRCC, rarely if ever produce complete responses
in mRCC, and in our Phase 2 clinical trial in this population, the combination therapy of AGS-003 and sunitinib did not show a
complete response rate that met the endpoint of the trial. 

Our product development costs will also increase if we experience
delays in testing or obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need
to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. For example, in response to our submission of an investigational
new drug application, or IND, for AGS-004, the FDA raised safety concerns regarding the analytical treatment interruption contemplated
by our protocol for our Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004, and required a one-year safety follow-up after the final dose for each
patient. This resulted in the need for an amendment to the trial protocol and a four-month delay prior to initiating the Phase
2 clinical trial in the United States. In addition to additional costs, significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any
periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring
products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results
of operations. 

The FDA has reviewed the protocol for our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 in combination
with sunitinib / targeted therapy under the SPA process. However, agreement by the FDA with the protocol under the SPA process
does not guarantee that the trial will be successful or that, if successful, AGS-003 will receive marketing approval.   

The FDA has reviewed, under the SPA process, the protocol for our ADAPT trial of AGS-003
in combination with sunitinib / targeted therapy. The SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDA s review and approval
of drug and biological products by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of Phase 3 clinical trials that are
intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug candidate s efficacy. In February 2012, we received a letter from
the FDA advising us that the FDA had completed its review of our protocol for the ADAPT trial under the SPA process. In the letter,
the FDA stated that it had determined that the protocol sufficiently addressed the trial s objectives and that the trial
was adequately designed to provide the necessary data to support a submission for marketing approval. 

An SPA does not guarantee that AGS-003 will receive marketing approval. The FDA may raise
issues related to safety, trial conduct, bias, deviation from the protocol, statistical power, patient completion rates, changes
in scientific or medical parameters or internal inconsistencies in the data prior to making its final decision. The FDA may also
seek the guidance of an outside advisory committee prior to making its final decision. In addition, the combination of AGS-003
and sunitinib may not achieve the primary endpoint of the trial. Even if the primary endpoint in our ADAPT trial is achieved, AGS-003
may not be approved. Many companies which have been granted SPAs have ultimately failed to obtain final approval to market their
products. 

In its February 2012 letter, the FDA informed us that in order for a single trial to
support approval of an indication, the trial must be well conducted, and the results of the trial must be internally consistent,
clinically meaningful and statistically very persuasive. If the results for the primary endpoint are not robust, are subject to
confounding factors, or are not adequately supported by other trial endpoints, the FDA may refuse to approve our BLA based upon
a single clinical trial. There can be no guarantee that the FDA will not require additional pivotal clinical trials before, or
as a condition for, approving AGS-003. 

If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical
trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.   

We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates
if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the
FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Our competitors may have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates
that could be competitive with our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may
instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors  product candidates. For example, during the Phase 1/2 monotherapy clinical
trial of AGS-003 that we conducted, our ability to enroll patients in the trial was adversely affected by the FDA s approval
of sorafenib and sunitinib, because patients did not want to receive, and physicians were reluctant to administer, AGS-003 as an
experimental monotherapy once new therapies that showed efficacy in clinical trials were introduced to the market and became widely
available. 

Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including: 

severity of the disease under investigation;   

eligibility criteria for the trial in question;   

perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;   

efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;   

patient referral practices of physicians;   

the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and   

proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.   

The actual amount of time for full enrollment of our clinical trials could be longer
than planned. Enrollment delays in any of our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates,
which would cause the value of the company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll
a sufficient number of patients for any of our other clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon
one or more clinical trials altogether. 

We are developing AGS-004 for use in combination with latency reversing drugs to
eradicate HIV. If latency reversing drugs are not successfully developed for HIV on a timely basis or at all, we will be unable
to develop AGS-004 for this use or will be delayed in doing so. In addition, because there are currently no products approved for
HIV eradication, we cannot be certain of the clinical trials that we will need to conduct or the regulatory requirements that we
will need to satisfy in order to obtain marketing approval of AGS-004 for this purpose.   

We are focusing our development program for AGS-004 on the use of AGS-004 in combination
with latency reversing drugs, including Vorinostat, to eradicate HIV. We plan to rely on these latency reversing drugs because
we recognize that the ultimate objective of virus eradication is unlikely to be achieved with immunotherapy alone because the immune
system is not able to recognize the HIV virus in latently infected cells with a low level or lack of expression of HIV antigens. 

Several companies and academic groups are evaluating latency reversing drugs that can
potentially activate latently infected cells to increase viral antigen expression and make the cells vulnerable to elimination
by the immune system. We are not a party to any arrangements with these companies or academic groups. If these companies or academic
groups determine not to develop latency reversing drugs for this purpose because the drugs do not sufficiently increase viral antigen
expression or have unacceptable toxicities, or these companies or academic groups otherwise determine to collaborate with other
developers of immunotherapies on a combination therapy for complete virus eradication, we will not be able to complete our AGS-004
development program. In addition, if these companies or academic groups do not proceed with such development on a timely basis,
our AGS-004 program correspondingly would be delayed. 

A number of the latency reversing drugs being evaluated for use in HIV patients are currently
approved in the United States and elsewhere for use in the treatment of specified cancer indications. For instance Vorinostat is
approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. If these drugs are not approved by the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory authorities
for use in HIV, the FDA and these other regulatory authorities may not approve AGS-004 without the latency reversing drug having
received marketing approval for HIV. If the FDA and these other regulatory authorities approve AGS-004 without the approval of
the latency reversing drug for HIV, the use of AGS-004 in combination with the latency reversing drug for virus eradication would
require sales of the latency reversing drug for off-label use. In such event, the success of the combination of AGS-004 and the
latency reversing drug would be subject to the willingness of physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical
community to use the latency reversing drug for off-label use and of government authorities and third party payors to pay for the
combination therapy. In addition, we would be limited in our ability to market the combination for its intended use if the latency
reversing drug were to be used off-label. 

Currently, there are no products approved for the eradication of HIV. As a result, we
cannot be certain as to the clinical trials we will need to conduct or the regulatory requirements that we will need to satisfy
in order to obtain marketing approval of AGS-004 for the eradication of HIV. 

If serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development
of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some of our product candidates.   

All of our product candidates are still in preclinical or clinical development and their
risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans
or will receive regulatory approval. If our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics
that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the
undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective.
In addition, such effects or characteristics could cause an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt,
delay or halt clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates, require us to conduct additional clinical trials or other
tests or studies, and could result in a more restrictive label, or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or comparable
foreign regulatory authorities. 

Our Arcelis-based product candidates are immunotherapies that are based on a novel
technology utilizing a patient s own tissue. This may raise development issues that we may not have anticipated or be able
to resolve, regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval or personnel issues that may prevent us from further developing
and commercializing our product candidates.   

AGS-003 and AGS-004 are based on our novel Arcelis technology platform. In the course
of developing this platform and these product candidates, we have encountered difficulties in the development process. For example,
we terminated the development of MB-002, the predecessor to AGS-003, when the results from the initial clinical trial of MB-002
indicated that the product candidate only corrected defects in the production of one of two critical cytokines required for effective
immune response. There can be no assurance that additional development problems will not arise in the future which we may not have
anticipated or be able to resolve or which may cause significant delays in development. 

In addition, regulatory approval of novel product candidates such as our Arcelis-based
product candidates manufactured using novel manufacturing processes such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for
other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical products, due to our and regulatory agencies 
lack of experience with them. The FDA has only approved one individualized immunotherapy product to date. This lack of experience
may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development
costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product
candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. 

The novel nature of our product candidates also means that fewer people are trained in
or experienced with product candidates of this type, which may make it difficult to find, hire and retain capable personnel for
research, development and manufacturing positions. 

Development of our individualized Arcelis-based product candidates is subject to
significant uncertainty because each product candidate is derived from source material that is inherently variable. This variability
could reduce the effectiveness of our Arcelis-based product candidates, delay any FDA approval of our Arcelis-based product candidates,
cause us to change our manufacturing methods and adversely affect the commercial success of any approved Arcelis-based products.   

The disease samples from the patients to be treated with our Arcelis-based products vary
from patient to patient. This inherent variability may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products because each tumor
or virus sample that we receive and process will yield a different product. As a result, we may not be able to consistently produce
a product for every patient and we may not be able to treat all patients effectively. Such inconsistency could delay FDA or other
regulatory approval of our Arcelis-based product candidates or, if approved, adversely affect market acceptance and use of our
Arcelis-based products. If we have to change our manufacturing methods to address any inconsistency, we may have to perform additional
clinical trials, which would delay FDA or other regulatory approval of our Arcelis-based product candidates and increase the costs
of development of our Arcelis-based product candidates. 

The inherent variability of the disease samples from the patients to be treated with
our Arcelis-based products may further adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products because variability in the source
material for our product candidates, such as tumor cells or viruses, may cause variability in the composition of other cells in
our product candidates. Such variability in composition or purity could adversely affect our ability to establish acceptable release
specifications and the development and regulatory approval processes for our product candidates may be delayed, which would increase
the costs of development of our Arcelis-based product candidates. 

If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory
approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially
impaired.   

Failure to obtain regulatory approval for either of our product candidates will prevent
us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates
in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals
and expect to rely on third party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing FDA approval requires
the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each therapeutic indication
to establish the product candidate s safety and efficacy. Securing FDA approval also requires the submission of information
about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the FDA. Our product candidates may
not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other
characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use. 

The process of obtaining regulatory approvals, both in the United States and abroad,
is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially
based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. To date, the FDA
has only approved one individualized immunotherapy product. Changes in clinical guidelines or regulatory approval policies during
the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for
each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA has substantial discretion
in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and
require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical
and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately
obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially
viable. 

If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our
product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will
be materially impaired. 

Failure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent
our product candidates from being marketed abroad.   

We are a party to arrangements with third parties, and intend to enter into additional
arrangements with third parties, under which they would market our products outside the United States. In order to market and sell
our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we or such third parties must obtain separate regulatory approvals
and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional
testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory
approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition,
in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can
be approved for sale in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the
United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries
or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities
in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary
approvals to commercialize our products in any market. 

A fast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development,
regulatory review or approval process.   

If a product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition
and the product demonstrates the potential to address an unmet need for this condition, the treatment sponsor may apply for FDA
fast track designation. In April 2012, the FDA notified us that we obtained fast track designation for AGS-003 for the treatment
of mRCC. Fast track designation does not ensure that we will experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process
compared to conventional FDA procedures. Additionally, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation
is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. 

Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital  

We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses
for at least the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.   

Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses.
Our net loss was $53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $37.7
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $316.6 million.
To date, we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of common stock and warrants, private placements of
common stock, preferred stock and warrants, convertible debt financings, debt from financial institutions, government contracts,
government and other third party grants and license and collaboration agreements. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts
to research and development, including clinical trials. We have not completed development of any product candidates. We expect
to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We anticipate that
our expenses will increase substantially if and as we: 

continue our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC;   

continue to support ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004;   

support planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004;   

initiate and conduct additional trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004 for the treatment of cancers and HIV;   

seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;   

lease, build out and equip a facility or enter into arrangements with a
    contract manufacturing organization for the commercial manufacture of products based on our Arcelis platform;   

establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;   

maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;   

continue our other research and development efforts;   

hire additional clinical, quality control, scientific and management personnel; and   

add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned commercialization efforts.   

To become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually
commercialize a product or products with significant market potential. This development and commercialization will require us to
be successful in a range of challenging activities, including successfully completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of
our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates, building out and equipping a commercial manufacturing
facility or entering into arrangements with a contract manufacturing organization and manufacturing, marketing and selling those
products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of some of these activities. We may
never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. 

Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability
on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair
our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts or continue our operations. A
decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment. 

We will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital
when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce, terminate or eliminate our product development programs, including plans to lease,
build out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility or our commercialization efforts and to take other actions to reduce our
operating expenses.   

We have no external sources of funds other than our contract
with the NIH and NIAID for the development of AGS-004, and we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities,
particularly as we continue our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC, continue to support ongoing investigator-initiated
clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004, support planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004, initiate
and conduct additional clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004 for the treatment of cancers and HIV, seek regulatory approval for
our product candidates and lease, build out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility or otherwise arrange for the commercial
manufacture of our products. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we expect to incur
significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to
continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial
additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive
terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce, terminate or eliminate our product development programs, our plans to lease, build
out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility or our commercialization efforts and to take other actions to reduce our operating
expenses. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $69.3 million and
working capital of $47.3 million. Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our cash and cash equivalents as of September
30, 2016, together with the anticipated funding under our contract with the NIH, and the NIAID will enable us to fund our operating
expenses through the second quarter of 2017. We expect that these funds will be sufficient to fund our operations until such time
as there are a sufficient number of events to permit the primary analysis and assessment of overall survival in the ADAPT trial
and to fund our share of the expected costs related to preparations for commercial manufacturing. We expect that these funds will
not, however, be sufficient to enable us to complete required activities in preparation for the submission of a BLA to the FDA
for AGS-003, to commercially launch AGS-003 or to complete the build-out and equipping of a commercial manufacturing facility without
entering into financing arrangements related to the facility. These expectations are based on our current operating plan under
which we implemented measures to reduce our operating expenses, including, among other measures, reductions in spending for activities
in preparation for submission of a BLA and a workforce reduction action plan designed to streamline operations and reduce our operating
expenses. We intend to seek to enter into collaborations for the development, marketing and distribution of AGS-003 outside North
America and of our non-oncology product candidates, including AGS-004. If we are unable to enter into any such collaborations,
we may be required to implement additional measures to materially reduce our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our
business and operations. It is also possible that our available funds will not enable us to reach a sufficient number of events
to permit the primary analysis and assessment of overall survival in the ADAPT trial because the actual costs and timing of clinical
trials are difficult to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays. 

We will also need to obtain significant financing to lease,
build out and equip a commercial manufacturing facility. We continue to explore financing arrangements in connection with the Centerpoint
facility. We are also exploring other alternatives for the commercial supply of our products. These alternatives include both internal
manufacturing solutions as well as potential contractual arrangements with contract manufacturing organizations. We expect that
we will enter into arrangements for the commercial manufacture of our products during the fourth quarter of 2016. Under either
the Centerpoint option or one of the alternatives, we expect that it will take approximately nine to 12 months to complete the
build-out and equipping of a commercial manufacturing facility and that such arrangements would likely involve material obligations.
However, other than with respect to our lease with TKC for Centerpoint, we have not entered into any binding arrangement with any
party with respect to the lease, build-out and equipping of a manufacturing facility or other arrangements for commercial manufacturing .
 If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on the terms we anticipate, on a timely basis or at all, we may not be
able to complete the planned leasing, build-out and equipping of a commercial facility or otherwise arrange for the commercial
manufacture of our products, or may be delayed in doing so, which in either case would delay the commercialization of AGS-003.  

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

the progress and results of our ADAPT trial and the ongoing and planned investigator-initiated clinical trials of AGS-003 that we support;   

the progress and results of the ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trial of AGS-004 in combination with vorinostat for HIV eradication and the planned investigator-initiated clinical trial of AGS-004 that we support and our ability to obtain additional funding under our NIH and NIAID contract for our AGS-004 program;   

the development, initiation and support of additional clinical trials of AGS-003 and AGS-004 in mRCC or other indications;   

the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other product candidates;   

the costs and timing of our lease, build-out and
    equipping of a commercial manufacturing facility or of alternative arrangements for commercial manufacturing and any costs
    and liabilities associated with financing arrangements entered into to fund the costs of these activities;   

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory submissions and review of our product candidates;   

the costs of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval;   

the potential need to repay the $6.0 million remaining outstanding under the loan under our license agreement with Medinet Co. Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MEDcell Co., Ltd, which we refer to together as Medinet;   

our ability to refinance our existing venture loan facility with the Lenders;   

revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates be approved by the FDA or a similar regulatory authority outside the United States;   

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;   

the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies;   

our ability to obtain government or other third party funding for the development of our product candidates; and   

our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all, particularly arrangements to develop, market and distribute AGS-003 outside North America and arrangements for the development and commercialization of our non-oncology product candidates, including AGS-004.   

Conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and
uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory
approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial
revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for several years,
if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Additional
financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 

Our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph
relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

Our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended
December 31, 2015 includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our losses from operations and required additional funding to
finance our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient
funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we
may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets
and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that
investors will lose all or a part of their investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future
and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may
be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 

Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict
our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.   

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect
to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government contracts, government and other
third party grants or other third party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances
and licensing arrangements. We will require substantial funding to complete the planned lease, build-out and equipping of a facility
for the commercial manufacture of products based on our Arcelis platform, complete required activities in preparation for the submission
of a BLA for AGS-003, fund our commercialization efforts and fund our other operating expenses and other activities. To the extent
that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted,
and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.
For example, in 2016 we have issued and sold securities under the private placement financing, the sales agreement with Cowen  
Company, LLC and the August 2016 public follow-on offering, each of which resulted in dilution to our existing stockholders. 

Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring
dividends. 

We currently intend to collaborate with third parties for the manufacturing, development
or commercialization of AGS-003 outside of North America. We plan to seek government or other third party funding for the continued
development of AGS-004 and to collaborate with third parties for the development and commercialization of AGS-004. If we raise
additional funds through government or other third party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations,
strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies,
future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
If the loan from Medinet becomes due and we do not repay it, we have agreed to grant Medinet a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license
to make and sell Arcelis products in Japan for the treatment of cancer. 

Our ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and tax credit carryforwards
may be limited.   

The utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject
to limitation under the rules regarding a change in stock ownership as determined by the Internal Revenue Code, and state and foreign
tax laws. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes annual limitations on the utilization of net
operating loss carryforwards, other tax carryforwards, and certain built-in losses upon an ownership change as defined under that
section. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions that increase the aggregate ownership of certain of
our stockholders by more than 50 percentage points over a three year testing period. If we have undergone a Section 382 ownership
change, an annual limitation would be imposed on certain of our tax attributes, including NOL and capital loss carryforwards, and
certain other losses, credits, deductions or tax basis. As of September 30, 2016, we have not completed a formal study to
determine whether there are 382 limitations that apply. However, we believe that, by engaging in the financing transactions in
which we have engaged, we may have triggered an  ownership change  limitation. We may also experience ownership changes
in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability
to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other tax credit carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income
may be subject to limitations, which potentially could result in increased future tax liability to us. 

Risk Related to the Commercialization of our Product Candidates  

We have no history of commercializing pharmaceutical products, which may make it
difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability.   

Our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing our company, developing
our technology and product candidates and establishing collaborations. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully
complete a pivotal clinical trial, compile an acceptable regulatory submission for product approval, obtain marketing approvals,
manufacture a commercial scale product or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization.
Consequently, predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of
successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products. 

In addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays
and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition at some point from a company with research and development focus
to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition. 

Even if AGS-003 or AGS-004 receives regulatory approval, it may fail to achieve
the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial
success.   

We have never commercialized a product candidate. Even if AGS-003 or AGS-004 receives
marketing approval, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and
others in the medical community. Gaining market acceptance for our Arcelis-based products may be particularly difficult as, to
date, the FDA has only approved one individualized immunotherapy and our Arcelis-based products are based on a novel technology.
If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not
become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a
number of factors, including: 

efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;   

the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;   

convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;   

the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;   

the strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;   

the approval of other new products for the same indications;   

the ability of our product to be combined with emerging standards of care;   

availability and amount of reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third party payors;   

adverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products;   

clinical indications for which the product is approved; and   

the prevalence and severity of any side effects.   

If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we, or others,
later discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously
identified, our ability to market the product could be compromised.   

Clinical trials of our product candidates are conducted in carefully defined subsets
of patients who have agreed to enter into clinical trials. Consequently, it is possible that our clinical trials may indicate an
apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any, in a broader patient population
or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. If, following approval of a product candidate, we, or others, discover
that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified,
any of the following adverse events could occur: 

regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;   

we may be required to recall the product or change the way the product is administered;   

additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular product;   

regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a  black box  warning or a contraindication;   

we may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution to patients;   

additional restrictions may be imposed on the distribution or use of the product via a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS;   

we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;   

the product may become less competitive; and   

our reputation may suffer.   

Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and business
and could adversely impact our stock price. 

If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements
with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates
if and when they are approved.   

We have only limited commercial capabilities and have no experience in the sale, marketing
or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales
and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. We plan to market and sell AGS-003 in North America independently
and to enter into collaborations or other arrangements with third parties for the distribution or marketing of AGS-003 in the rest
of the world. We plan to enter into collaborations or other arrangements with third parties for the distribution or marketing of
AGS-004 and any of our other product candidates should such candidates receive marketing approval. 

There are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities
and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force
is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we
recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely
or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain
or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. 

Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include: 

our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;   

the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;   

the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;   

unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and   

inability to establish customer service and access services, including potential supply chain and specialty pharmacy arrangements.   

If we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution
services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues to us are likely to be lower than if we were to market
and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third
parties to sell and market our product candidates or doing so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control
over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products
effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third
parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates. 

We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing
or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.   

The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We
face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any products that we
may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and
biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market
and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing
our product candidates. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private
research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development,
manufacturing and commercialization. 

Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific
approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Many marketed
therapies for the indications that we are currently pursuing, or indications that we may in the future seek to address using our
Arcelis platform, are widely accepted by physicians, patients and payors, which may make it difficult for us to replace them with
any products that we successfully develop and are permitted to market. 

The FDA has approved several targeted therapies as monotherapies for mRCC, including
Nexavar (sorafenib), marketed by Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Sutent (sunitinib) and
Inlyta (axitinib), marketed by Pfizer, Inc.; Avastin (bevacizumab), marketed by Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group; Votrient
(pazopanib) and Afinitor (everolimus), marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; Torisel (temsirolimus), marketed by Pfizer
and most recently, Opdivo (nivolumab), marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Cabometyx (cabozantinib), marketed by Exelixis, for
second-line mRCC. In addition, we estimate that there are numerous therapies for mRCC in clinical development by many public and
private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting numerous different cancer types and stages. A number of these are
in late stage development including Opdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) in combination for first-line mRCC, which are currently
being compared in a Phase 3 trial to sunitinib. In addition, if a standalone therapy for mRCC were developed that demonstrated
improved efficacy over currently marketed first-line therapies with a favorable safety profile and without the need for combination
therapy, such a therapy might pose a significant competitive threat to AGS-003. 

We are currently conducting our ADAPT trial of AGS-003 plus sunitinib / targeted therapy.
We elected to study AGS-003 in clinical trials in combination with sunitinib due in part to sunitinib being the current standard-of-care
for first-line treatment of mRCC. Although we do not expect to seek FDA approval of AGS-003 solely in combination with sunitinib
and have provided that, under the protocol for the ADAPT trial, investigators may discontinue sunitinib due to disease progression
or toxicity and initiate second-line treatment with other approved compatible therapies, if we obtain approval by the FDA, such
FDA approval may be limited to the combination of AGS-003 and sunitinib. In such event, the commercial success of AGS-003 would
be linked to the commercial success of sunitinib. As a result, if sunitinib ceases to be the standard-of-care for first-line treatment
of mRCC or another event occurs that adversely affects sales of sunitinib, the commercial success of AGS-003 may be adversely affected. 

There are also numerous FDA-approved treatments for HIV, primarily antiretroviral therapies
marketed by large pharmaceutical companies. Generic competition has developed in this market as patent exclusivity periods for
older drugs have expired, with more than 15 generic drugs currently on the market. The presence of these generic drugs is resulting
in price pressure in the HIV therapeutics market and could affect the pricing of AGS-004. Currently, there are no approved therapies
for the eradication of HIV. We expect that major pharmaceutical companies that currently market antiretroviral therapy products
or other companies that are developing HIV product candidates may seek to develop products for the eradication of HIV. 

Our competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient
or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors
may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. 

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise
in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and
marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and device industries may
result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies
may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical
trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for,
our programs. 

Even if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, the products may become
subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm
our business.   

The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug
products vary widely from country to country. In the United States, recently passed legislation may significantly change the approval
requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval
of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product
licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental
control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular
country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods,
and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations
may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain regulatory
approval. 

Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the
extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration
authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third party payors, such as private health
insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A
primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third party payors
have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly,
third party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging
the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize
and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product
candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because
of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. If reimbursement is not available
or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain
marketing approval. 

There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs,
and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities
outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or
at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels
for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates
may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already
set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced
by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of
laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.
Third party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies.
Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved
products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to
commercialize products and our overall financial condition. 

Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities
and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.   

We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our
product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may
develop. These risks may be even greater with respect to our Arcelis-based products which are manufactured using a novel technology.
None of our product candidates has been widely used over an extended period of time, and therefore our safety data are limited.
We derive the raw materials for manufacturing of our Arcelis-based product candidates from human cell sources, and therefore the
manufacturing process and handling requirements are extensive and stringent, which increases the risk of quality failures and subsequent
product liability claims. 

If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates
or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may
result in: 

decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;   

injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;   

withdrawal of clinical trial participants;   

significant costs to defend the related litigation;   

substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;   

loss of revenue; and   

the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.   

We currently hold $10.0 million in product liability insurance coverage, which may
not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We will need to increase our insurance coverage when we begin commercializing
our product candidates, if ever. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage
at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. 

We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or
indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater
likelihood of success.   

Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs
and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product
candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may
cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future
research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. 

We have based our research and development efforts on our Arcelis platform. Notwithstanding
our large investment to date and anticipated future expenditures in our Arcelis platform, we have not yet developed, and may never
successfully develop, any marketed drugs using this approach. As a result of pursuing the development of product candidates using
our Arcelis platform, we may fail to develop product candidates or address indications based on other scientific approaches that
may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. 

Our long-term business plan is to develop Arcelis-based products for the treatment of
various cancers and infectious diseases. We may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates
that may be manufactured using our Arcelis platform. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical,
financial and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates,
yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development. 

If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular
product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty
arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights
to such product candidate. 

Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties  

Our reliance on government funding adds uncertainty to our research and commercialization
efforts and may impose requirements that increase the costs of commercialization and production of our government-funded product
candidates.   

Our current development of AGS-004 for HIV is primarily funded by the NIH. We are dependent
upon further government funding for continued development of AGS-004. However, increased pressure on governmental budgets may reduce
the availability of government funding for programs such as AGS-004. In addition, contracts and grants from the U.S. government
and its agencies include provisions that give the government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found
in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the government to: 

terminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;   

reduce or modify the government s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;   

claim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;   

impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;   

suspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government or a specific government agency;   

pursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and   

limit the government s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.   

Government agreements normally contain additional terms and conditions that may increase
our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions.
These include, for example: 

specialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants;   

mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;   

public disclosures of certain contract and grant information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and   

mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.   

We expect to depend on collaborations with third parties for the development and
commercialization of our product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the
market potential of these product candidates.   

We currently intend to commercialize AGS-003 independently in North America. We intend
to collaborate with other third parties to manufacture, develop or commercialize AGS-003 outside North America. We have entered
into an exclusive license agreement with Pharmstandard International S.A., or Pharmstandard, for the development and commercialization
of AGS-003 in Russia and the other states comprising the Commonwealth of Independent States and an exclusive license agreement
with Green Cross Corp., or Green Cross, for the development and commercialization of AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC in South
Korea and an exclusive license agreement with Lummy (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd., or Lummy HK, for the development, manufacture and commercialization
of AGS-003 in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. We have also entered into a license agreement with Medinet under which we granted
Medinet an exclusive license to manufacture in Japan AGS-003 for the purpose of development and commercialization for the treatment
of mRCC. We also plan to seek government or other third party funding for continued development of AGS-004 and to collaborate with
third parties to develop and commercialize AGS-004. Our likely collaborators for any development, distribution, marketing, licensing
or broader collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical
companies and biotechnology companies. 

Under our existing arrangements we have limited control, and under any additional arrangements
we may enter into with third parties we will likely have limited control, over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators
dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements
will depend on our collaborators  abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. 

Collaborations involving our product candidates would pose the following risks to us: 

collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;   

collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator s strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;   

collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or, require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;   

collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;   

a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;   

collaborators may have the right to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates without our consent and could conduct trials with flawed designs that result in data that adversely affect our clinical trials, our ability to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates or market acceptance of our product candidates. Pharmstandard, Green Cross, Medinet and Lummy HK each have this right under our license agreements with them;   

collaborators may hold rights that could preclude us from commercializing our products in certain territories. For example, we have granted Medinet an exclusive license to manufacture in Japan AGS-003 for the treatment of mRCC. If we and Medinet are unable to agree to the terms of a supply agreement under these circumstances, we will not be able to sell AGS-003 in Japan unless we repurchase these rights from Medinet;   

collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;   

disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and   

collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates. For example, our collaboration with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. with respect to AGS-003 and AGS-004 was terminated by our collaborator.   

Collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product
candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations
among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. If a present or
future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development
or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated. 

If we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter
our development and commercialization plans.   

Our drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates
will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we intend to collaborate with pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies for the development and commercialization of those product candidates. For example, we have entered
into license agreements with third parties to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize AGS-003 in Russia and the other states
comprising the Commonwealth of Independent States, South Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, and we intend to collaborate
with other third parties to develop and commercialize AGS-003 in other parts of the world and to collaborate with third parties
to develop and commercialize AGS-004. 

We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach
a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources
and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration, and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number
of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar
regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities
of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty
with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits
of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates
or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more
attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under existing license agreements from entering
into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document.
We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. 

If we are not able to obtain such funding or enter into collaborations for our product
candidate, we may have to curtail the development of such product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or
more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities,
or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase
our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which
may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop
these product candidates or bring these product candidates to market and generate product revenue. 

We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties
may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.   

We do not independently conduct clinical trials of our product candidates. We rely on
third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical
investigators, to perform this function. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control
over these activities but does not relieve us of our oversight responsibilities as sponsor of the trial. We remain responsible
for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for
the trial. Moreover, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good
Clinical Practice, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results
are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required
to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database,
ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.
Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these
third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in
accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining,
regulatory approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize
our product candidates. 

For instance, in December 2015 we received a notice from Health Canada that one of the
sites at which we are conducting our Phase 3 ADAPT trial in Canada had been found to be non-compliant with Good Clinical Practice
in Canada and that if the issues raised in the notice were not corrected, Health Canada could suspend our authorization to conduct
the ADAPT trial at all sites in Canada. We submitted a response to Health Canada and subsequently received a Completion of Response
notice from Health Canada stating that our corrective actions were satisfactory and that the matter was officially closed. 

We also rely on other third parties to store and distribute product supplies for our
clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future distributors could delay clinical development or
regulatory approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us
of potential product revenue. 

Risks Related to the Manufacturing of Our Product Candidates  

We plan to build out a facility to manufacture our Arcelis-based products on a
commercial scale. We do not have experience in manufacturing Arcelis-based products on a commercial scale. If, due to our
lack of manufacturing experience, we cannot manufacture our Arcelis-based products on a commercial scale successfully or manufacture
sufficient product to meet our expected commercial requirements, our business may be materially harmed.   

We currently have manufacturing suites in our facility located at our corporate
headquarters in Durham, North Carolina. We manufacture our Arcelis-based product candidates for research and development purposes
and for clinical trials at this facility. In August 2014, we entered into a ten-year lease agreement with renewal options with
the developer, TKC LXXII, LLC, or TKC. Under the lease agreement, we agreed to lease certain land and an approximately 125,000
square-foot building to be constructed in Durham County, North Carolina, which we refer to as Centerpoint. We intended this facility
to house our corporate headquarters and commercial manufacturing. The shell of the new facility was constructed on a build-to-suit
basis in accordance with agreed upon specifications and plans and was completed in June 2015. However, the build-out and equipping
of the interior of the facility has not been completed as we explore potential financing arrangements. 

Under the lease agreement, we had an option to purchase the property. In February 2015,
we exercised this purchase option and entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with TKC. The purchase price to be paid by us
was $7.4 million plus the amount of any additional costs incurred by TKC as a result of changes requested by us, for which we had
paid $1.7 million as of October 31, 2016, and the amount of any improvement allowances advanced to us by TKC prior to the closing.
Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we had until February 16, 2016 to consummate the purchase of the property.
We did not purchase the property by such date. As a result, we have no further right to purchase the property and remain subject
to the lease under the Lease Agreement. 

We continue to explore financing arrangements in connection
with the Centerpoint facility. We are also exploring alternatives for the commercial supply of our products. These alternatives
include both internal manufacturing solutions as well as potential contractual arrangements with contract manufacturing organizations.
We expect that we will enter into arrangements for the commercial manufacture of our products during the fourth quarter of 2016.
Under either the Centerpoint option or one of the alternatives, we expect that it will take approximately nine to 12 months to
complete the build-out and equipping of a commercial manufacturing facility and that such arrangements would likely involve material
obligations. However, other than with respect to our lease with TKC for Centerpoint, we have not entered into any binding arrangement
with any party with respect to the lease, build-out and equipping of a manufacturing facility or alternative arrangements for commercial
manufacturing, and any potential arrangements have not been finalized and are subject to change. There can be no assurance that
we will enter into arrangements on the terms previously available to us, on a timely basis or at all. 

We plan to initiate commercial manufacturing using our current
manual manufacturing process and have decided to complete the development and implementation of our automated manufacturing process
after commercial launch. Prior to implementing commercial manufacturing of AGS-003, we would be required to demonstrate that the
commercial manufacturing facility is constructed and operated in accordance with current good manufacturing practice. We would
also be required to show the comparability between AGS-003 that we produce using the manual processes in our current facility and
AGS-003 produced using the manual process in the commercial manufacturing facility. 

If we transition to automated manufacturing processes, we expect our
automated manufacturing processes will be based on existing functioning prototypes of automated devices for the production of commercial
quantities of our Arcelis-based product candidates. These devices can be used to perform substantially all steps required for the
manufacture of our Arcelis-based product candidates. 

We do not have experience in manufacturing products on a commercial scale or using automated
processes. In addition, because we are aware of only one company that has manufactured an individualized immunotherapy product
for commercial sale, there are limited precedents from which we can learn. We may encounter difficulties in the manufacture of
our Arcelis-based products due to our limited manufacturing experience. These difficulties could delay the build-out and equipping
of a commercial manufacturing facility and regulatory approval of the manufacture of our Arcelis-based products using the facility,
increase our costs or cause production delays or result in us not manufacturing sufficient product to meet our expected commercial
requirements, any of which could damage our reputation and hurt our profitability. If we are unable to successfully increase our
manufacturing capacity to commercial scale, our business may be materially adversely affected. 

We need to establish commercial manufacturing operations and augment our manufacturing
personnel in advance of any regulatory submission for approval of AGS-003. If we fail to establish commercial manufacturing operations
in compliance with regulatory requirements, or augment our manufacturing personnel, we may not be able to initiate commercial operations
or produce sufficient product to meet our expected commercial requirements. We have delayed the implementation of our automated
manufacturing process and may not be able to use such process on a timely basis or at all.   

In order to meet our business plan, which contemplates manufacturing
our product first using manual processes and later using automated processes for the commercial requirements of AGS-003 and any
other Arcelis-based product candidates that might be approved, we plan to lease, build out and equip a commercial manufacturing
facility or enter into arrangements with a commercial manufacturing organization and add manufacturing personnel, in advance of
any regulatory submission for approval of AGS-003. The planned leasing, build-out and equipping of a commercial manufacturing facility
or, alternatively, the build out and equipping of a leased commercial manufacturing facility, will require substantial capital
expenditures and additional regulatory approvals. In addition, it will be costly and time consuming to recruit necessary additional
personnel. 

If we are unable to successfully build out and equip a commercial
manufacturing facility or enter into arrangements with a commercial manufacturing organization in compliance with regulatory requirements
or hire and train additional necessary manufacturing personnel appropriately, our filing for regulatory approval of AGS-003 may
be delayed or denied. 

We plan to delay the implementation of our automated manufacturing process until we obtain
additional funding, and thus plan to seek approval of AGS-003 and, if approved, to initially commercially supply AGS-003 using
manual manufacturing processes. Prior to implementing commercial manufacturing of AGS-003, we will be required to demonstrate that
the commercial manufacturing facility is constructed and operated in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP.
We will also be required to show the comparability between AGS-003 that we produce using the manual processes in our current facility
and AGS-003 produced using the manual process in the new facility. 

Our implementation of automated processes could take longer, particularly if we are unable
to achieve any of the required tasks on a timely basis, or at all. We are collaborating with Invetech Pty Ltd., or Invetech, and
Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, or Saint-Gobain, to develop the equipment and disposables necessary to implement
the automated manufacturing processes for Arcelis-based products. If Invetech or Saint-Gobain do not perform as expected under
the agreements or the projects with Invetech or Saint-Gobain are unsuccessful for any other reason, our timelines for the implementation
of our automated manufacturing processes could be further delayed and our business could be adversely affected. 

Prior to implementing the automated manufacturing processes for Arcelis-based products,
we will be required to: 

demonstrate that the disposable components and sterilization and packaging
        methods used in the manufacturing process are suitable for use in manufacturing in accordance with current good manufacturing practice,
        or cGMP, and current Good Tissue Practices, or cGTP; 

build and validate processing equipment that complies with cGMP and cGTP; 

equip a commercial manufacturing facility to accommodate the automated manufacturing
        process; 

perform process testing with final equipment, disposable components and reagents
        to demonstrate that the methods are suitable for use in cGMP and cGTP manufacturing; 

demonstrate consistency and repeatability of the automated manufacturing processes
        in the production of AGS-003 in our new facility to fully validate the manufacturing and control process using the actual automated
        cGMP processing equipment; and 

demonstrate comparability between AGS-003 that we produce using our manual processes and AGS-003 produced using the automated processes.   

We will need regulatory approval to use the automated manufacturing processes for commercial
purposes. If the FDA requires us to conduct a bridging study to demonstrate comparability between AGS-003 that we produce manually
and AGS-003 produced using the automated processes, the implementation of the automated manufacturing processes and the filing
for such approval will likely be delayed. 

If we are unable to successfully implement the automated processes required and demonstrate
comparability between the AGS-003 that we produce manually and the AGS-003 produced using the automated processes, our filing for
regulatory approval of the commercial use of our automated manufacturing processes may be delayed or denied and we may not be able
to initiate commercial manufacturing using our automated manufacturing processes. In such event, our commercial manufacturing costs
will be higher than anticipated and we may not be able to manufacture sufficient product to meet our expected commercial requirements. 

Lack of coordination internally among our employees and externally with physicians,
hospitals and third- party suppliers and carriers, could cause manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays and cause us to
not have sufficient product to meet our expected clinical trial requirements or potential commercial requirements.   

Manufacturing our Arcelis-based product candidates requires coordination internally among
our employees and externally with physicians, hospitals and third party suppliers and carriers. For example, a patient s
physician or clinical site will need to coordinate with us for the shipping of a patient s disease sample and leukapheresis
product to our manufacturing facility in a timely manner, and we will need to coordinate with them for the shipping of the manufactured
product to them. Such coordination involves a number of risks that may lead to failures or delays in manufacturing our Arcelis-based
product candidates, including: 

failure to obtain a sufficient supply of key raw materials of suitable quality;   

difficulties in manufacturing our product candidates for multiple patients simultaneously;   

difficulties in obtaining adequate patient-specific material, such as tumor samples, virus samples or leukapheresis product, from physicians;   

difficulties in completing the development and validation of the specialized assays required to ensure the consistency of our product candidates;   

failure to ensure adequate quality control and assurances in the manufacturing process as we increase production quantities;   

difficulties in the timely shipping of patient-specific materials to us or in the shipping of our product candidates to the treating physicians due to errors by third party carriers, transportation restrictions or other reasons;   

destruction of, or damage to, patient-specific materials or our product candidates during the shipping process due to improper handling by third party carriers, hospitals, physicians or us;   

destruction of, or damage to, patient-specific materials or our product candidates during storage at our facilities; and   

destruction of, or damage to, patient-specific materials or our product candidates stored at clinical and future commercial sites due to improper handling or holding by clinicians, hospitals or physicians.   

If we are unable to coordinate appropriately, we may encounter delays or additional costs
in achieving our clinical and commercialization objectives, including in obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates
and supplying product, which could materially damage our business and financial position. 

If our existing manufacturing facility or any commercial manufacturing facility
that we are using is damaged or destroyed, or production at one of these facilities is otherwise interrupted, our business and
prospects would be negatively affected.   

We currently have a single manufacturing facility and expect
that the commercial manufacturing facility that we plan to build out and equip will be our only commercial manufacturing facility
in North America. If our existing manufacturing facility or any new commercial manufacturing facility or the equipment in either
of these facilities, is damaged or destroyed, we likely would not be able to quickly or inexpensively replace our manufacturing
capacity and possibly would not be able to replace it at all. Any new facility needed to replace either our existing manufacturing
facility or a new commercial manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements, need to be
tailored to our specialized automated manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment. We would need FDA approval
before selling any products manufactured at a new facility. Such an event could delay our clinical trials or, if any of our product
candidates are approved by the FDA, reduce or eliminate our product sales. 

We maintain insurance coverage to cover damage to our property and equipment and to cover
business interruption and research and development restoration expenses. If we have underestimated our insurance needs with respect
to an interruption in our clinical manufacturing of our product candidates, we may not be able to adequately cover our losses. 

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property  

If we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses
with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.   

We are a party to a number of intellectual property license agreements with third parties,
including with respect to each of AGS-003 and AGS-004, and we expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future.
Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone
payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. For example, under our license agreement with Duke University which relates
to patents and patent applications directed towards the composition of matter of Arcelis-based products, dendritic cells loaded
with RNA from tumors or pathogens, methods of manufacture of these products and methods of using these products to treat tumors,
we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and market license products and to satisfy other specified
obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these licenses, our licensors may have the right to terminate these
license agreements, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by these agreements, or to convert
the license to a non-exclusive license, which could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed
under the license agreement. Termination of these license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result
in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. 

If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and
products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license
from them, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize
technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products
may be adversely affected.   

Our success depends in large part on our and our licensors  ability to obtain and
maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We
and our licensors have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad
related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming,
and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely
manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development efforts before it
is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation,
filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products that we license from
third parties and are reliant on our licensors. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted
and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If such licensors fail to maintain such patents, or
lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated. 

The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly
uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result,
the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors  patent rights are highly uncertain.
Our and our licensors  pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology
or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the
patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents
or narrow the scope of our patent protection. 

Third parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent
protection. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United
States. For example, we own or exclusively license patents relating to our process of manufacturing an individualized drug product.
A U.S. patent may be infringed by anyone who, without authorization, practices the patented process in the United States or imports
a product made by a process covered by the U.S. patent. In foreign countries, however, importation of a product made by a process
patented in that country may not constitute an infringing activity, which would limit our ability to enforce our process patents
against importers in that country. Furthermore, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries,
do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. This could make it difficult for us to stop
the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. If competitors are able to use
our technologies, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed. 

Furthermore, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind
the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until
18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to
make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the
first to file for patent protection of such inventions. 

Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States, the
first to invent the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application
is generally entitled to the patent. Under the America Invents Act, or AIA, enacted in September 2011, the United States moved
to a first inventor to file system in March 2013. The United States Patent and Trademark Office only recently finalized the rules
relating to these changes and courts have yet to address the new provisions. These changes could increase the costs and uncertainties
surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patent rights. Furthermore, we may
become involved in interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, or other post-grant proceedings, such as reissue, reexamination
or inter partes review proceedings, which may challenge our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination
in any such proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize
our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize
products without infringing third party patent rights. 

Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue
in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide
us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar
or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope,
validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United
States and abroad. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit
our ability to or stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products,
or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development,
testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after
such candidates are commercialized. For example, certain of the U.S. patents we exclusively license from Duke University expired
in 2016 and the European and Japanese patents exclusively licensed from Duke University expire in 2017. As a result, our owned
and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar
or identical to ours. 

We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could
be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.   

Competitors may infringe our patents. To counter such infringement or unauthorized use,
we may be required to file infringement claims against third parties, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, during
an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that the patent rights we are asserting are invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse
to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question.
An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted
narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation,
there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In
addition, our licensors may have rights to file and prosecute such claims and we are reliant on them. 

Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their
intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of
our business.   

Our commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators
to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary
rights of third parties. We cannot ensure that third parties do not have, or will not in the future obtain, intellectual property
rights such as granted patents that could block our ability to operate as we would like. There may be patents in the United States
or abroad owned by third parties that, if valid, may block our ability to make, use or sell our products in the United States or
certain countries outside the United States, or block our ability to import our products into the United States or into certain
countries outside the United States. 

We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation
regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. For example, third parties may assert infringement
claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party s
intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing
our products and technology. However, we may be unable to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or even
obtain a license at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access
to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing
technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from
commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business.
Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative
impact on our business. 

We have research licenses to certain reagents and their use in the development of our
product candidates. We would need commercial licenses to these reagents for any of our product candidates that receive approval
for sale in the United States. We believe that commercial licenses to these reagents will be available. However, if we are unable
to obtain any such commercial licenses, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates without infringing the patent
rights of third parties. If we did seek to commercialize our product candidates without a license, these third parties could initiate
legal proceedings against us. 

We may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed
alleged trade secrets of their former employers.   

Many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology
or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do
not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees
have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee s
former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition
to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending
against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources
and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.   

Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual
property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their
normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim
proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial
adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses
and reduce the resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately
conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings
more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation
of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. 

If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business
and competitive position would be harmed.   

In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely
on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position.
The types of protections available for trade secrets are particularly important with respect to our Arcelis platform s manufacturing
capabilities, which involve significant unpatented know-how. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into
non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators,
outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties.
We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these
efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets,
and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated
a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and
outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully
obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information
to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive
position would be harmed. 

Risks Related to Legal Compliance Matters  

Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to
restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements
or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.   

Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing
processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual
requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other
post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality
assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, cGTP requirements, requirements regarding the distribution of
samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject
to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements
for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates
the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance
with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers  communications regarding
off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for
off-label marketing. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing
processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including: 

restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;   

restrictions on the marketing of a product;   

restrictions on product distribution;   

requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;   

warning or untitled letters;   

withdrawal of the products from the market;   

refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;   

recall of products;   

fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;   

suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;   

refusal to permit the import or export of our products;   

product seizure; or   

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.   

Our relationships with customers and third party payors will be subject to applicable
anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties,
program exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.   

Healthcare providers, physicians and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation
and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third party payors
and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain
the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we
obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;   

the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;   

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;   

the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;   

the federal transparency requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Health Care Reform Law will require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; and   

analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures.   

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry s
voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug
manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers
or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances,
many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by the federal Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with
applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude
that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud
and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any
other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties,
damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring
of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not
in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from
government funded healthcare programs. 

Recently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for
us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.   

In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative
and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our
product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates
for which we obtain marketing approval. 

In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
Act of 2003, or Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation
expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales
prices for physician administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that
will be covered in any therapeutic class in certain cases. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this and other more
recent legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that is provided for any approved products. While the Medicare
Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy
and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the
Medicare Modernization Act or other more recent legislation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 

In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping
law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against
fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on
the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises
the definition of  average manufacturer price  for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid
drug rebates to states. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription
drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices
with health care practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state
agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform
Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and
may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 

Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements
and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes
will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes
on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the
FDA s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product
labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. 

With the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or
BPCIA, as part of the Health Care Reform Law, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological
products was created. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar
biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as  interchangeable  based on its similarity to an existing
brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or approved
by the FDA until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product was approved under a BLA. The new
law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation
and meaning is subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such
processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products. 

We believe that if any of our product candidates were to be approved as biological products
under a BLA, such approved products should qualify for the four-year and 12-year periods of exclusivity. However, there is a risk
that the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten these exclusivity periods as proposed by President Obama,
or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating
the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will
be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological
products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. 

If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations,
we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.   

We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including
those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.
Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials.
Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials
and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury
resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed
our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties. 

Although we maintain workers  compensation insurance to cover us for costs and
expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide
adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims
that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials. 

In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development
or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other
sanctions. 

Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth  

Our future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer
and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.   

We are highly dependent on Jeffrey Abbey, our President and Chief Executive Officer,
Charles Nicolette, our Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, Lee F. Allen, our Chief Medical
Officer and Richard Katz, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as the other principal members of our management
and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not
prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain  key person  insurance
for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of
our research, development and commercialization objectives. 

Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and
marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable
terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience
competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely
on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development
and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments
under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. 

We expect to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing and sales and marketing
capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.   

We expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope
of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and sales and marketing. To
manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems,
expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources
and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively
manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations
may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth
could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock  

Our executive officers, directors and affiliates of all officers and directors
who own our outstanding common stock maintain the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.   

Our executive officers, directors and affiliates of our executive
officers and directors beneficially own, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 61.49% of our outstanding common stock
as of November 7, 2016. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to control all matters
submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to
act together, would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially
all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other
stockholders may desire. 

Our largest stockholder, Pharmstandard, could exert significant influence over
us and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including any change of control.   

Our largest stockholder, Pharmstandard, beneficially owns, in
the aggregate, shares representing approximately 39.60% of our outstanding common stock as of November 7, 2016. In addition, two
members of our board of directors are affiliates of Pharmstandard. As a result, we expect that Pharmstandard will be able to exert
significant influence over our business. Pharmstandard may have interests that differ from your interests, and it may vote in a
way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. The concentration of ownership of our capital stock may
have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity
to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and may adversely affect the market price of our common
stock. 

Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make
an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders
to replace or remove our current management.   

Provisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a
merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which
you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing
to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because
our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent
any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace
members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions: 

establish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;   

allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;   

limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;   

establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;   

require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;   

limit who may call stockholder meetings;   

authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a  poison pill  that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and   

require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.   

Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions
of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding
voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person
acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. 

An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.   

Although our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, an active trading market
for our shares may not be sustained. If an active market for our common stock is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to
sell your shares without depressing the market price for the shares or sell your shares at all. Any inactive trading market for
our common stock may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund our operations by selling shares and may impair
our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration. 

If our stock price continues to be volatile, purchasers of our common stock could
incur substantial losses.   

Our stock price is likely to be volatile. For example, our stock has traded in a range
from a low of $1.61 and high of $13.97 during the period of February 7, 2014 through November 7, 2016. The stock market in general
and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the
operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including: 

our cash resources;   

results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;   

the success of competitive products or technologies;   

potential approvals of our product candidates for marketing by the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory authorities or our failure to obtain such approvals;   

regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;   

the results of our efforts to commercialize our product candidates;   

developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;   

the recruitment or departure of key personnel;   

the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;   

the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;   

actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;   

variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;   

changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;   

market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts  reports or recommendations;   

general economic, industry and market conditions; and   

the other factors described in this  Risk Factors  section.   

We will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public
company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance
practices.   

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish
a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, while we remain an emerging growth company,
we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent
registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 within the prescribed
period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly
and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants
and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps
to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement
a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material
weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our
financial statements. 

We are an  emerging growth company,  and the reduced disclosure requirements
applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.   

We are an  emerging growth company,  as defined in the JOBS Act, and may
remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and
plan to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies. These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions
from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. In our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not include all of the executive compensation
related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will
find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as
a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 

In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company
to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have
irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be
subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 

Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in
the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.   

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend
to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In September 2014, we entered
into a venture loan and security agreement with Horizon and Fortress. The terms of this agreement preclude us from paying dividends.
As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.  

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate
or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.   

The trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that
securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be
no assurance that analysts will cover us, or provide favorable coverage. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change
their opinion of our stock to be less favorable, our share price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more analysts cease
coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could
cause our share price or trading volume to decline.

located in Durham County, North Carolina (the   Property  ) as such Improvements and Property are more particularly
defined in the Lease Agreement. 

B.       TKC,

amended by that certain Fourth Amendment to Lease Agreement effective June 25, 2015, that certain Second Amendment to Purchase

to which TKC agreed to sell the Property to Argos, and Argos agreed to purchase the Property from TKC, on the terms set forth therein. 

C.       Argos
has (i) informed TKC that Argos is unable to consummate the Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) on or before September
30, 2016 as contemplated by the Fourth Amendment, and (ii) requested that the Parties amend the Purchase Agreement to allow for
the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) to occur, if at all, at Argos s option on or before October 31, 2016. 

D.       The
Parties desire to amend each of the Lease Agreement and the Purchase Agreement as set forth herein. 

AGREEMENT : 

NOW, THEREFORE ,
in consideration of these premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
the Parties agree as follows: 

1.        Consideration
for TKC s Extension of Option to Close; Purchase Price . 

(a)       The
Parties acknowledge and agree that TKC has received three deposits (collectively, the   Delivered Deposits  )
from Argos in connection with the Purchase Agreement as follows: (i) the first in the amount of $381,033 delivered on or about
February 16, 2015; (ii) the second in the amount of $100,000 delivered on or about January 15, 2016, and (iii) an additional deposit
of $49,000 delivered on or about July 2, 2016. 

(b)       As
a condition precedent to the effectiveness of this Agreement, (x) a counterpart of this Agreement shall be executed by Argos and
delivered by Argos to TKC on or before October 3, 2016 and (y) Argos shall make a payment to TKC (on or before October 5, 2016)
in immediately available funds in the amount of $150,000.00 (the   Additional Payment  ). 

(c)       The
Parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in either the Lease Agreement or the Purchase
Agreement, the Delivered Deposits and the Additional Payment shall serve as consideration to TKC for TKC s agreement to amend
the Lease Agreement and the Purchase Agreement to,  inter alia , provide Argos with an option to purchase the Property at
a later date on the terms set forth herein. Argos further acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the Delivered Deposits and the Additional
Payment are forfeited to TKC as of the Effective Date (defined below) as consideration for TKC s extension of the option
to purchase; (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in either the Lease Agreement or the Purchase Agreement, neither
the Delivered Deposits nor the Additional Payment may be used at Closing to reduce the Purchase Price (each as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) except that if the closing occurs on or before October 7, then $135,000 of the Additional Payment shall be applied to
reduce the Purchase Price; and (iii) the Delivered Deposits and the Additional Payment shall be fully earned by TKC and non-refundable
as of the Effective Date. 

(d)       The
Parties further acknowledge and agree that the Purchase Price (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) is Seven Million Three Hundred
Ninety Thousand and No/100 DOLLARS ($7,390,000.00). 

(e)       The
Parties also agree that except as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Argos has no right to purchase the Property and the purchase
option contained in the Lease is null and void. 

(f)       As
further consideration for TKC s agreement to extend the outside date for Closing to October 31, 2016 pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, the Parties agree that the Lease is amended to provide that the Reduced Allowance (as defined in the Lease) in the amount
of $206,500 shall not be payable to Argos unless and until Argos closes on the purchase of the Property pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement on or before October 31, 2016 and if Argos fails to close on the purchase of the Property on or before October 31, 2016
for any reason other than a default by TKC of its obligation to close, then the Reduced Allowance shall not be payable by TKC and
Argos shall have no right whatsoever to receive the Reduced Allowance. 

(g) The Parties
agree that Section 5 of the Purchase Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 

SECTION
5. Closing. The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be held at the offices of Escrow Agent or by mail, or
at such other place as the parties may mutually agree. As used in this Agreement,  Closing  means the delivery of the
deed to Buyer, the delivery of the other closing documents described in Section 7 hereunder and the delivery of the Purchase Price
to Seller. The date of the Closing shall be selected by the Buyer but shall occur not later than October 31, 2016, time being of
the essence and the parties agree that the Closing shall be effected through the Escrow Agent and the physical presence at Closing
shall not be required by either representatives of Buyer or Seller. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein
as the  Closing Date . 

2   

2.        Effectiveness .
This Agreement shall become effective as of the Effective Date when, and only when, each of the following conditions shall have
been satisfied or waived, in the sole discretion of TKC: 

(a)       TKC
shall have received counterparts of this Agreement duly executed by each of TKC and Argos. 

(b)       TKC
shall have received the Additional Payment. 

3.        Conditions
Precedent and Closing Documents . Argos acknowledges and agrees that as of the date hereof all of TKC s obligations under
the Lease and the Purchase Agreement have been satisfied and that all of the conditions to be satisfied by TKC under the Lease
and the Purchase Agreement prior to the Closing have been satisfied. Argos acknowledges and agrees that TKC has delivered all of
the documents to be delivered by TKC at Closing under the Purchase Agreement to Escrow Agent and such documents are in form and
substance satisfactory to Argos. 

4.        Ratification;
Miscellaneous; Assignment . Time is of the essence with respect to all of the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.
Each of the Lease Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, as amended by this Agreement, shall remain enforceable in accordance with
its terms. Terms and provisions of either the Lease Agreement or the Purchase Agreement that are not expressly modified by this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. As amended by this Agreement, all of the terms, conditions and provisions of each
of the Lease Agreement and the Purchase Agreement are hereby ratified and affirmed in all respects. To the extent any terms, conditions
and obligations contained in this Agreement conflict with the terms in either the Lease Agreement or the Purchase Agreement, those
in this Agreement shall control. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same instrument, and any of the signatories hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Agreement may be assigned by Buyer without the consent
of Seller.
