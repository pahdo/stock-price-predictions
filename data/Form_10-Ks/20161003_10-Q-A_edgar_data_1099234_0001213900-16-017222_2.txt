the period covered by this report;

4.         I
am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)

or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 

5.         I

significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
and 

(b)         Any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
internal control over financial reporting.
