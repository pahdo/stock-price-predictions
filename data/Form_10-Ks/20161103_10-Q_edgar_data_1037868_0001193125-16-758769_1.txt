1.  
  Basis of Presentation       The accompanying consolidated financial statements are unaudited.
AMETEK, Inc. (the  Company ) believes that all adjustments (which primarily consist of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of the Company at September 30, 2016, the
consolidated results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been included. Quarterly results of operations are not
necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes presented in the Company s Annual Report on  Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.      

2.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements       In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )  No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
 ( ASU 2014-09 ).  The objective of  ASU 2014-09  is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from
contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of  ASU 2014-09  is that an entity recognizes revenue at the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the new guidance, the Company must (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2)
identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contract s performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance
obligation.  ASU 2014-09  applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
 ASU 2014-09  is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and can be adopted by the Company using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective
approach.  ASU 2014-09  may be early adopted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company has developed an implementation plan, which is currently in the
assessment phase. The Company is in the process of determining the impact  ASU 2014-09  may have on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and financial
statement disclosures, and has not decided upon the method of adoption.    In February 2015, the FASB issued  ASU No. 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ).   ASU 2015-02  is intended
to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed
security transactions).  ASU 2015-02  makes specific amendments to the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entities
guidance. The Company adopted  ASU 2015-02  effective January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or
cash flows.    In April 2015, the FASB issued  ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ).   ASU 2015-03  requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the associated debt liability. The Company adopted  ASU 2015-03  effective January 1, 2016 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated results
of operations, financial position or cash flows.    In April 2015, the FASB issued
 ASU No. 2015-05  , Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   ( ASU 2015-05 ).   ASU 2015-05  is intended to help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. The guidance clarifies that customers should determine whether a cloud computing
arrangement includes the license of software by applying the same guidance cloud service providers use to make this determination. The Company prospectively adopted  ASU 2015-05  effective January 1,
2016 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

  In July 2015, the FASB issued
 ASU No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   ( ASU 2015-11 ),  which applies to inventory that is measured using first-in,
first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost. As prescribed in this update, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out ( LIFO ).
 ASU 2015-11  is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual
reporting period. The Company has not determined the impact  ASU 2015-11  may have on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued  ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes   ( ASU 2015-17 ).   ASU 2015-17  simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be
classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet.  ASU 2015-17  is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
 ASU 2015-17  may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. The Company has not determined the impact  ASU 2015-17  may have on
the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows and has not decided upon the method of adoption.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued  ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ).  The new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer
than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.  ASU 2016-02  is effective for interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  ASU 2016-02  is to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company has not determined
the impact  ASU 2016-02  may have on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and financial statement disclosures.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued  ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ).   ASU 2016-09  includes changes to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09  is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company has not determined the impact  ASU 2016-09  may have on the Company s consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash
flows and financial statement disclosures.    In August 2016, the FASB issued
 ASU No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ),  which clarifies how entities should classify
certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15  also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of
more than one class of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15  is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company has not determined
the impact  ASU 2016-15  may have on the Company s consolidated cash flows and financial statement disclosures.

  Earnings Per Share       The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares considered outstanding during the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per share reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities (principally outstanding stock options and restricted stock grants).
The number of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share was as follows:

  Fair Value Measurements       Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be
received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  
 The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value. This hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the
Company s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement.    The following table provides the Company s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, consistent with the fair value hierarchy:      
   The fair value of fixed-income investments, which are valued as level 1 investments, was based on quoted
market prices. The fixed-income investments are shown as a component of long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet.    For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, gains and losses on the investments noted above were not significant. No transfers between level 1 and level 2 investments occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  Financial Instruments     Cash, cash
equivalents and fixed-income investments are recorded at fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  
 The following table provides the estimated fair values of the Company s financial instrument liabilities, for which fair value is
measured for disclosure purposes only, compared to the recorded amounts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:      
   The fair value of  short-term  borrowings, net approximates the carrying
value. Short-term borrowings, net are valued as level 2 liabilities as they are corroborated by observable market data. The Company s long-term debt, net is all privately held with no public market for this debt, therefore, the fair value
of long-term debt, net was computed based on comparable current market data for similar debt instruments and is considered to be a level 3 liability.

6.  
  Hedging Activities       The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated
long-term borrowings as hedges of the net investment in certain foreign operations. As of September 30, 2016, these net investment hedges included British-pound-denominated long-term debt. These borrowings were designed to create net investment
hedges in each of the designated foreign subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British
pound exchange rate. These net investment hedges are evidenced by management s contemporaneous documentation supporting the hedge designation. Any gain or loss on the hedging instruments (the debt) following hedge designation is reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness.  
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had $156.1 million of British-pound-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against
the net investment in British pound functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the British-pound-denominated loans being designated and 100% effective as net investment hedges, $21.0 million of currency remeasurement gains have
been included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

  Acquisitions       The Company spent $360.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to
acquire Brookfield Engineering Laboratories ( Brookfield ) and ESP/SurgeX in January 2016, and HS Foils and Nu Instruments in July 2016. Brookfield is a manufacturer of viscometers and rheometers, as well as
instrumentation to analyze texture and powder flow. ESP/SurgeX is a manufacturer of energy intelligence and power protection, monitoring and diagnostic solutions. HS Foils develops and manufactures key components used in radiation detectors
including ultra-thin radiation windows, silicon drift detectors and  x-ray  filters. Nu Instruments is a provider of magnetic sector mass spectrometers used for elemental and isotope analysis. Brookfield,
ESP/SurgeX, HS Foils and Nu Instruments are part of AMETEK s Electronic Instruments Group.    The following table represents
the preliminary allocation of the aggregate purchase price for the net assets of the above acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at acquisition (in millions):      

(1) 
 Includes $14.1 million in accounts receivable, whose fair value, contractual cash flows and expected cash flows are approximately equal.

  The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits the Company expects to realize
from the acquisitions as follows: Brookfield s viscosity measurement instrumentation products and technologies complement the Company s existing laboratory instrumentation businesses and provides the Company with opportunities to expand
that business platform into a broader range of markets and applications. ESP/SurgeX s patented technology is widely used by the business equipment, imaging, audio visual, information technology, gaming and vending industries and is a strategic
fit with the Company s existing power protection platform to accelerate product innovation and market expansion worldwide. HS Foils broadens the Company s product offering and technical capabilities with its approach of bringing
advanced materials and fabrication methods from micro- and nanofabrication to new application areas. Nu Instruments broadens the Company s product offering and technical capabilities in differentiated, high-end analytical instrumentation.
The Company expects approximately $100 million of the goodwill recorded in connection with the 2016 acquisitions will be tax deductible in future years.  
 At September 30, 2016, purchase price allocated to other intangible assets of $179.5 million consists of $33.3 million of
indefinite-lived intangible trade names, which are not subject to amortization. The remaining $146.2 million of other intangible assets consists of $118.2 million of customer relationships, which are being amortized over a period of 18 to
20 years and $28.0 million of purchased technology, which is being amortized over a period of 15 to 18 years. Amortization expense for each of the next five years for the 2016 acquisitions listed above is expected to approximate
$8 million per year.    The Company is in the process of finalizing the measurement of certain tangible and intangible assets and
liabilities for its July 2016 acquisition of Nu Instruments, including property, plant and equipment, goodwill, customer relationships, trade names, purchased technology and the accounting for income taxes, as well as accounting for income
taxes associated with its January 2016 acquisition of ESP/SurgeX.    The 2016 acquisitions noted above had an immaterial impact on
reported net sales, net income and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Had the 2016 acquisitions been made at the beginning of 2016 or 2015, unaudited pro forma net sales, net income and diluted
earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, would not have been materially different than the amounts reported. Pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that would
have occurred if the acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of 2016 or 2015.      Acquisitions Subsequent to September 30, 2016    
 In October 2016, the Company acquired Laserage Technology Corporation ( Laserage ). Laserage was acquired for approximately
$32 million and has estimated annual sales of approximately $22 million. Laserage is a provider of laser fabrication services for the medical device market. Laserage will join AMETEK s Electromechanical Group.  
   
   The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill by segment were as follows:

   At September 30, 2016, the Company had gross unrecognized tax
benefits of $57.3 million, of which $47.7 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.    The following is a
reconciliation of the liability for uncertain tax positions (in millions):      
   The reductions for tax positions was driven by the release of uncertain tax position liabilities primarily
relating to statute expirations for U.S. Federal, Foreign and State jurisdictions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The amounts recognized in income tax expense for
interest and penalties during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.      
   In March 2016, the Company along with certain of its foreign subsidiaries
amended and restated its credit agreement dated as of September 22, 2011 (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company s existing $700 million revolving credit facility, which was due to
expire in December 2018. The Credit Agreement consists of a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $850 million with a final maturity date in March 2021. The revolving credit facility total borrowing
capacity excludes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $300 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the Credit Agreement under certain conditions. The Credit Agreement
places certain restrictions on allowable additional indebtedness. Interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility are at the applicable benchmark rate plus a negotiated spread or at the U.S. prime rate. At
September 30, 2016, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $558.7 million under its revolving credit facility, including the $300 million accordion feature.  
 In October 2016, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell 500 million Euros and 225 million British pounds
in senior notes to a group of institutional investors (the  2016 Private Placement ). There are two funding dates under 2016 Private Placement. The first funding occurred in October 2016 for 500 million Euros
($547.9 million), consisting of 300 million Euros ($328.7 million) in aggregate principal amount of 1.34% senior notes due October 2026 and 200 million Euros ($219.2 million) in aggregate principal amount of 1.53%
senior notes due October 2028. The second funding date will be in November 2016 for 225 million British pounds, consisting of 150 million British pounds in aggregate principal amount of 2.59% senior notes due November 2028
and 75 million British pounds in aggregate principal amount of 2.70% senior notes due November 2031. The 2016 Private Placement senior notes will carry a weighted average interest rate of 1.82% and are subject to certain customary
covenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain certain   debt-to-EBITDA   (earnings before interest, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization) and interest coverage ratios. The proceeds from the first funding of the 2016 Private Placement were used to pay down domestic borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility. The proceeds from the second
funding of the 2016 Private Placement will be used to pay down a 40 million British pound ($52.1 million at September 30, 2016) 5.99% senior note that is maturing in November 2016 and provides the Company with additional
financial flexibility to support its growth plans, including its successful acquisition strategy.

  Share-Based Compensation       Total share-based compensation expense was as follows:  
   
   Pre-tax share-based compensation expense is included in the consolidated statement of income in either Cost of
sales, excluding depreciation or Selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on where the recipient s cash compensation is reported.  
 The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a   Black-Scholes-Merton   option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in the   Black-Scholes-Merton  
model to estimate the fair values of stock options granted during the years indicated:      
   Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock. The Company used
historical exercise data to estimate the stock options  expected term, which represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding. Management anticipates that the future stock option holding periods will
be similar to the historical stock option holding periods. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected term of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant. Compensation expense recognized for all
share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The Company s estimated forfeiture rates are based on its historical experience.  
 The following is a summary of the Company s stock option activity and related information:

  The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $15.0 million. The total fair value of stock options vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10.6 million. As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $21.3 million of
expected future  pre-tax  compensation expense related to the 2.8 million nonvested stock options outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately
two years.    The following is a summary of the Company s nonvested restricted stock activity and related information:  
   
   The total fair value of restricted stock vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
$10.9 million. As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $31.2 million of expected future  pre-tax  compensation expense related to the 1.0 million nonvested restricted shares
outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years.

  Retirement and Pension Plans       The components of net periodic pension benefit expense
(income) were as follows:      
   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, contributions to the Company s defined
benefit pension plans were $3.0 million and $52.4 million, respectively. The Company s current estimate of 2016 contributions to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans is in line with the range disclosed in the Company s
Annual Report on  Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015.

   The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale
of its products. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Company s operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and
adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.    Changes in the accrued product warranty obligation were as
follows:      
   Certain settlements of warranties made during the period were for specific nonrecurring warranty obligations.
Product warranty obligations are reported as current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.      
    Asbestos Litigation   
 The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a defendant, along with many other companies, in a number of asbestos-related
lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate to businesses which were acquired by the Company and do not involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which are under new
ownership. In connection with many of these lawsuits, the sellers or new owners of such businesses, as the case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these claims (the  Indemnified Claims ). The Indemnified Claims have been
tendered to, and are being defended by, such sellers and new owners. These sellers and new owners have met their obligations, in all respects, and the Company does not have any reason to believe such parties would fail to fulfill their obligations
in the future; however, one of these companies filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007. To date, no judgments have been rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related lawsuit. The Company believes it has strong defenses to the
claims being asserted and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in these matters.     Environmental Matters   
 Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal
and state laws and regulations. At September 30, 2016, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party ( PRP ) at 14 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the  non-owned  sites). The Company is
identified as a  de minimis  party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In nine of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative
agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate
the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de
minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company s expected obligations. The Company historically has
resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain
of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the  owned  sites). For claims and proceedings against the

Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves
through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of
the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not
expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Company s liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the
ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.    Total environmental reserves at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 were $27.8 million and $30.5 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $2.4 million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent
$4.5 million on environmental matters and had $0.6 million due to foreign currency translation losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company s reserves for environmental liabilities at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 include reserves of $12.4 million and $11.5 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries ( HCC ). The Company is the designated
performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the
former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $11.8 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed
third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCC s former owners for approximately $19 million of additional costs.  
 The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned
businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other
parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.  
 The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent
orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an
adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.  

16.  
  Reportable Segments       The Company has two reportable segments, Electronic Instruments
Group ( EIG ) and Electromechanical Group ( EMG ). The Company s operating segments are identified based on the existence of segment managers. Certain of the Company s operating segments have been aggregated for segment
reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product type, production processes, distribution methods and similarity of economic characteristics.  
 At September 30, 2016, there were no significant changes in identifiable assets of reportable segments from the amounts disclosed at
December 31, 2015, other than those described in the acquisitions footnote (Note 8), nor were there any significant changes in the basis of segmentation or in the measurement of segment operating results. Operating information relating to
the Company s reportable segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 can be found in the table included in Part I, Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations  of this Quarterly Report on  Form 10-Q.

  Stockholders  Equity       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company repurchased approximately 4,995,000 shares of its common stock for $236.1 million in cash under its share repurchase authorization. At September 30, 2016, $75.7 million was available under the Company s Board of
Directors authorization for future share repurchases. On November 2, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved an increase of $400 million in the authorization for repurchase of the Company s common stock.  
   
   During the first quarter of 2015, the Company recorded
pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $15.9 million, which had the effect of reducing net income by $10.8 million ($0.04 per diluted share). The restructuring charges were reported in the consolidated statement of income as follows:
$15.8 million in Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and $0.1 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The restructuring charges were reported in segment operating income as follows: $9.3 million in EIG,
$6.5 million in EMG and $0.1 million in corporate administrative expenses. The restructuring actions primarily related to a reduction in workforce in response to the impact of the weak global economy on certain of the Company s
businesses and the effects of a continued strong U.S. dollar. The restructuring activities have been broadly implemented across the Company s various businesses with all actions expected to be completed in the second half of 2016.  
 During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $20.7 million, which had the effect of
reducing net income by $13.9 million ($0.06 per diluted share). The restructuring charges were reported in the consolidated statement of income as follows: $20.0 million in Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and $0.7 million in
Selling, general and administrative expenses. The restructuring charges were reported in segment operating income as follows: $9.3 million in EIG, $10.8 million in EMG and $0.7 million in corporate administrative expenses. The
restructuring actions primarily related to a reduction in workforce in response to the impact of the weak global economy on certain of the Company s businesses and the effects of a continued strong U.S. dollar. The restructuring activities
will be broadly implemented across the Company s various businesses through the end of 2016, with all actions expected to be completed in the second half of 2017.  
 Accrued liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheet included amounts related to the 2015 restructuring charges as follows (in
millions):

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        Results
of Operations     The following table sets forth net sales and income by reportable segment and on a consolidated basis:  

(1) 
 After elimination of intra- and intersegment sales, which are not significant in amount.    

(2) 
 Segment operating income represents net sales less all direct costs and expenses (including certain administrative and other expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include interest expense.
     In both the third quarter of 2016 and the first nine months of 2016, the Company was impacted by the weak global economy
and the effects of a continued strong U.S. dollar. Specifically, the Company experienced lower sales in its Process businesses with exposure to oil and gas markets, in its Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses with metals
markets exposure and in its highly competitive Floor Care and Specialty Motors businesses. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company noted stabilization in the markets mentioned above; however, compared with the prior year, the Company still expects
the challenging global economic environment to continue to impact its markets and geographies through the remainder of 2016.  
 Contributions from the acquisitions of HS Foils and Nu Instruments in July 2016, and Brookfield Engineering Laboratories
( Brookfield ) and ESP/SurgeX in January 2016, as well as the Company s Operational Excellence initiatives, including the 2015 realignment actions, had a positive impact on the third quarter of 2016 and the first nine months of
2016 results. The Company recorded realignment costs totaling $36.6 million, with $15.9 million recorded in the first quarter of 2015 and $20.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 (the  2015 realignment costs ).
The 2015 realignment costs primarily related to reductions in workforce in response to the impact of the weak global economy on certain of the Company s businesses, as well as the effects of a continued strong U.S. dollar. See Note 18

Results of Operations (continued)   
   
    Results of operations for the third quarter of 2016 compared with the third quarter of 2015
     Net sales for the third quarter of 2016 were $945.0 million, a decrease of $53.5 million or 5.4%, compared with net
sales of $998.5 million for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in net sales for the third quarter of 2016 was due to an 8% internal sales decline, partially offset by a 3% increase from acquisitions.  
 Total international sales for the third quarter of 2016 were $499.0 million or 52.8% of net sales, a decrease of $5.7 million or
1.1%, compared with international sales of $504.7 million or 50.5% of net sales for the third quarter of 2015. The $5.7 million decrease in international sales was primarily driven by the weak global economy noted above. Both reportable
segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia.    Orders for the third quarter of 2016 were
$964.2 million, a decrease of $15.5 million or 1.6%, compared with $979.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in orders for the third quarter of 2016 was due to a 4% internal order decline resulting from the weak
global economy noted above, partially offset by a 2% increase from acquisitions.    Segment operating income for the third quarter of 2016
was $214.1 million, a decrease of $35.1 million or 14.1%, compared with segment operating income of $249.2 million for the third quarter of 2015. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 22.7% for the third
quarter of 2016, compared with 25.0% for the third quarter of 2015.    Cost of sales, excluding depreciation expense for the third quarter
of 2016 was $612.7 million or 64.8% of net sales, a decrease of $19.1 million or 3.0%, compared with $631.8 million or 63.3% of net sales for the third quarter of 2015. The cost of sales, excluding depreciation expense decrease for
the third quarter of 2016 was affected by the net sales decrease noted above.    Selling, general and administrative ( SG A )
expenses for the third quarter of 2016 were $113.2 million, an increase of $1.1 million or 1.0%, compared with $112.1 million for the third quarter of 2015. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses were 12.0% for the third
quarter of 2016, compared with 11.2% for the third quarter of 2015. Selling expenses for the third quarter of 2016 were $100.4 million or essentially flat, compared with $100.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. Selling expenses, as a
percentage of net sales, increased to 10.6% for the third quarter of 2016, compared with 10.1% for the third quarter of 2015. The increase in selling expenses as a percentage of sales were due primarily to business acquisitions. The Company s
acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses, which tend to have a higher rate of selling expenses because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs. Base business selling expenses decreased approximately 5%
for the third quarter of 2016.    Corporate administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2016 were $12.8 million, an increase of
$1.3 million or 11.3%, compared with $11.5 million for the third quarter of 2015. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.4% for the third quarter of 2016, compared with 1.1% for the third quarter of 2015.
   Depreciation expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $18.0 million or 1.9% of net sales, an increase of $1.0 million or 5.9%,
compared with $17.0 million or 1.7% of net sales for the third quarter of 2015. The increase in depreciation expense for the third quarter of 2016 was driven by the impact of the acquisitions noted above.  
 Consolidated operating income was $201.1 million or 21.3% of net sales for the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $36.5 million or
15.4%, compared with $237.6 million or 23.8% of net sales for the third quarter of 2015.    The effective tax rate for the third
quarter of 2016 was 25.0%, compared with 26.1% for the third quarter of 2015. The effective tax rates for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 reflect the impact of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates. The third quarter of 2016 effective
tax rate reflects the release of uncertain tax position liabilities primarily relating to statute expirations for U.S. Federal and State jurisdictions totaling $7.7 million. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 reflects
$7.5 million of tax benefits related to the closure of an international subsidiary.

Results of Operations (continued)   
   
  Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $130.7 million, a decrease of
$25.7 million or 16.4%, compared with $156.4 million for the third quarter of 2015.    Diluted earnings per share for the third
quarter of 2016 were $0.56, a decrease of $0.09 or 13.8%, compared with $0.65 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2015.      Segment Results
      Electronic Instruments Group s  ( EIG ) net sales totaled $579.3 million for the third quarter of 2016,
a decrease of $19.2 million or 3.2%, compared with $598.5 million for the third quarter of 2015. The net sales decrease was due to an 8% internal sales decline, driven largely by the Company s Process businesses with exposure to oil
and gas markets, offset by a 5% increase from the 2016 acquisitions of Nu Instruments, Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX.    EIG s
operating income was $142.7 million for the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $19.8 million or 12.2%, compared with $162.5 million for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in EIG s operating income for the third quarter of
2016 resulted primarily from the decrease in net sales noted above and the resulting lower operating income from the Group s base businesses. EIG s operating margins were 24.6% of net sales for the third quarter of 2016, compared with
27.2% of net sales for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in EIG s operating margins for the third quarter of 2016 resulted primarily from the impact of the Group s 8% internal sales decline.  
  Electromechanical Group s  ( EMG ) net sales totaled $365.7 million for the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of
$34.3 million or 8.6%, compared with $400.0 million for the third quarter of 2015. The net sales decrease was due to a 7% internal sales decline, driven largely by weakness in the Company s Engineered Materials, Interconnects and
Packaging businesses, and an unfavorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation.    EMG s operating income was $71.4 million
for the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $15.3 million or 17.6%, compared with $86.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. EMG s operating margins were 19.5% of net sales for the third quarter of 2016, compared with 21.7% of net
sales for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in EMG s operating income and operating margins for the third quarter of 2016 resulted primarily from the decrease in net sales noted above.  
   Results of operations for the first nine months of 2016 compared with the first nine months of 2015    
 Net sales for the first nine months of 2016 were $2,867.1 million, a decrease of $119.2 million or 4.0%, compared with net sales of
$2,986.3 million for the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in net sales for the first nine months of 2016 was due to an 8% internal sales decline, partially offset by a 4% increase from acquisitions.  
 Total international sales for the first nine months of 2016 were $1,504.7 million or 52.5% of net sales, a decrease of $23.5 million
or 1.5%, compared with international sales of $1,528.2 million or 51.2% of net sales for the first nine months of 2015. The $23.5 million decrease in international sales was primarily driven by the weak global economy noted above. Both
reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia.    Orders for the first nine months of
2016 were $2,876.5 million, a decrease of $81.9 million or 2.8%, compared with $2,958.4 million for the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in orders for the first nine months of 2016 was due to a 6% internal order decline
resulting from the weak global economy noted above, partially offset by a 3% increase from acquisitions. As a result, the Company s backlog of unfilled orders at September 30, 2016 was $1,157.2 million, an increase of
$9.4 million or 0.8%, compared with $1,147.8 million at December 31, 2015.

Results of Operations (continued)   
   
  Segment operating income for the first nine months of 2016 was $667.8 million, a
decrease of $67.9 million or 9.2%, compared with segment operating income of $735.7 million for the first nine months of 2015. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 23.3% for the first nine months of 2016,
compared with 24.6% for the first nine months of 2015. For the first nine months of 2015, segment operating income included $15.8 million of realignment costs recorded in the first quarter of 2015, which negatively impacted segment operating
margins by approximately 50 basis points. The decrease in segment operating income and segment operating margins for the first nine months of 2016 resulted primarily from the decrease in net sales noted above.  
 Cost of sales, excluding depreciation expense for the first nine months of 2016 was $1,839.6 million or 64.2% of net sales, a decrease of
$62.1 million or 3.3%, compared with $1,901.7 million or 63.7% of net sales for the first nine months of 2015. Cost of sales, excluding depreciation expense for the first nine months of 2015 included $15.8 million of realignment costs
described above. The cost of sales, excluding depreciation expense decrease and the corresponding decrease in cost of sales, excluding depreciation expense as a percentage of sales for the first nine months of 2016 were affected by the net sales
decrease noted above.    SG A expenses for the first nine months of 2016 were $344.3 million, an increase of $8.6 million or
2.6%, compared with $335.7 million for the first nine months of 2015. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses were 12.0% for the first nine months of 2016, compared with 11.2% for the first nine months of 2015. Selling expenses for the
first nine months of 2016 were $306.2 million, an increase of $6.8 million or 2.3%, compared with $299.4 million for the first nine months of 2015. The selling expenses increase was due primarily to business acquisitions. Selling
expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 10.7% for the first nine months of 2016, compared with 10.0% for the first nine months of 2015. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased primarily due to essentially flat period
over period base business selling expenses to support the Company s businesses, on lower first nine months of 2016 base business net sales.  
 Corporate administrative expenses for the first nine months of 2016 were $38.1 million, an increase of $1.8 million or 5.0%,
compared with $36.3 million for the first nine months of 2015. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.3% for the first nine months of 2016, compared with 1.2% for the first nine months of 2015.  
 Depreciation expense for the first nine months of 2016 was $54.5 million or 1.9% of net sales, an increase of $4.5 million or 9.0%,
compared with $50.0 million or 1.7% of net sales for the first nine months of 2015. The increase in depreciation expense for the first nine months of 2016 was driven by the impact of the acquisitions noted above.  
 Consolidated operating income was $628.7 million or 21.9% of net sales for the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of
$70.2 million or 10.0%, compared with $698.9 million or 23.4% of net sales for the first nine months of 2015.    Interest expense
was $70.7 million for the first nine months of 2016, an increase of $1.7 million or 2.5%, compared with $69.0 million for the first nine months of 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher borrowings under the revolving credit
facility to help fund acquisitions and share repurchases.    Other expenses, net were $10.1 million for the first nine months of 2016,
an increase of $3.8 million, compared with $6.3 million for the first nine months of 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher professional fees.  
 The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was 26.4%, compared with 27.2% for the first nine months of 2015. The effective tax
rates for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 reflect the impact of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates. The first nine months of 2016 effective tax rate reflects tax benefits related to international and state tax planning
initiatives and the release of uncertain tax position liabilities relating to statute expirations for U.S. Federal, Foreign and State jurisdictions totaling $11.6 million that occurred primarily in the second and third quarter of 2016. The
first nine months of 2015 effective tax rate reflects the first quarter of 2015 release of uncertain tax position liabilities related to the conclusion of an advance thin capitalization agreement in the European Union, the second quarter of 2015
effective settlement of the U.S. research and development tax credit from the completion of an Internal Revenue Service examination for 2010 and 2011, and the third quarter of 2015 $7.5 million of tax benefits related to the closure of an
international subsidiary.

Results of Operations (continued)   
   
  Net income for the first nine months of 2016 was $403.1 million, a decrease of
$50.9 million or 11.2%, compared with $454.0 million for the first nine months of 2015. The first quarter of 2015 realignment costs described above reduced the first nine months of 2015 net income by $10.8 million.  
 Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2016 were $1.72, a decrease of $0.15 or 8.0%, compared with $1.87 per diluted share
for the first nine months of 2015.      Segment Results    
  EIG s  net sales totaled $1,744.2 million for the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $44.6 million or 2.5%, compared
with $1,788.8 million for the first nine months of 2015. The net sales decrease was due to an 8% internal sales decline, driven largely by the Company s Process businesses with exposure to oil and gas markets, partially offset by a 5%
increase from the 2016 acquisitions of Nu Instruments, Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX and the 2015 acquisition of Surface Vision.  
 EIG s operating income was $436.6 million for the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $41.1 million or 8.6%, compared with
$477.7 million for the first nine months of 2015. EIG s operating margins were 25.0% of net sales for the first nine months of 2016, compared with 26.7% of net sales for the first nine months of 2015. For the first nine months of 2015,
EIG s operating income included $9.3 million of realignment costs recorded in the first quarter of 2015, which negatively impacted EIG s operating income margins by approximately 50 basis points. The decrease in EIG s
operating income and operating margins for the first nine months of 2016 resulted primarily from the decrease in net sales noted above.  
  EMG s  net sales totaled $1,122.9 million for the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $74.6 million or 6.2%,
compared with $1,197.5 million for the first nine months of 2015. The net sales decrease was due to an 8% internal sales decline, driven largely by weakness in the Company s Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses and
lower sales in the Company s Floor Care and Specialty Motors businesses, and an unfavorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 3% increase from the 2015 acquisition of Global Tubes.  
 EMG s operating income was $231.2 million for the first nine months of 2016, a decrease of $26.7 million or 10.4%, compared
with $257.9 million for the first nine months of 2015. EMG s operating margins were 20.6% of net sales for the first nine months of 2016, compared with 21.5% of net sales for the first nine months of 2015. For the first nine months of
2015, EMG s operating income included $6.5 million of realignment costs recorded in the first quarter of 2015, which negatively impacted EMG s operating income margins by approximately 60 basis points. The decrease in EMG s
operating income and operating margins for the first nine months of 2016 resulted primarily from the decrease in net sales noted above.

   Financial Condition   
   Liquidity and Capital Resources    
 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $509.5 million for the first nine months of 2016, an increase of $36.4 million or 7.7%,
compared with $473.1 million for the first nine months of 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $49.4 million reduction in defined benefit pension plan contributions, driven by a
$50.0 million contribution to the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the first quarter of 2015. Free cash flow (cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was $469.0 million for the first nine
months of 2016, compared with $427.8 million for the first nine months of 2015. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $740.8 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared with
$802.1 million for the first nine months of 2015. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they are measures used by third parties in evaluating the Company.  
 Cash used for investing activities totaled $400.0 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared with $401.9 million for the
first nine months of 2015. For the first nine months of 2016, the Company paid $360.0 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire HS Foils and Nu Instruments in July 2016, and Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX in January 2016. For the
first nine months of 2015, the Company paid $356.5 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire Surface Vision in July 2015 and Global Tubes in May 2015. Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $40.5 million for the first
nine months of 2016, compared with $45.3 million for the first nine months of 2015.    Cash used for financing activities totaled
$41.4 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared with $101.1 million for the first nine months of 2015. For the first nine months of 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 4,995,000 shares of its common stock for
$236.1 million, compared with $306.5 million used for repurchases of approximately 5,576,000 shares for the first nine months of 2015. At September 30, 2016, $75.7 million was available under the Company s Board of
Directors authorization for future share repurchases.    On November 2, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved an
increase of $400 million in the authorization for repurchase of the Company s common stock.    Short-term borrowings increased
$237.1 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared with an increase of $160.2 million for the first nine months of 2015. Net long-term borrowings remained unchanged for the first nine months of 2016, compared with an increase of
$53.1 million for the first nine months of 2015.    In March 2016, the Company along with certain of its foreign subsidiaries
amended and restated its credit agreement dated as of September 22, 2011 (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company s existing $700 million revolving credit facility, which was due to
expire in December 2018. The Credit Agreement consists of a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $850 million with a final maturity date in March 2021. The revolving credit facility total borrowing
capacity excludes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $300 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the Credit Agreement under certain conditions. The Credit Agreement
places certain restrictions on allowable additional indebtedness. Interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility are at the applicable benchmark rate plus a negotiated spread or at the U.S. prime rate. The revolving
credit facility provides the Company with additional financial flexibility to support its growth plans, including its successful acquisition strategy. At September 30, 2016, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $558.7 million
under its revolving credit facility, including the $300 million accordion feature.

Financial Condition (continued)   
   
  In October 2016, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell
500 million Euros and 225 million British pounds in senior notes to a group of institutional investors (the  2016 Private Placement ). There are two funding dates under 2016 Private Placement. The first funding occurred in
October 2016 for 500 million Euros ($547.9 million), consisting of 300 million Euros ($328.7 million) in aggregate principal amount of 1.34% senior notes due October 2026 and 200 million Euros ($219.2 million)
in aggregate principal amount of 1.53% senior notes due October 2028. The second funding date will be in November 2016 for 225 million British pounds, consisting of 150 million British pounds in aggregate principal amount of
2.59% senior notes due November 2028 and 75 million British pounds in aggregate principal amount of 2.70% senior notes due November 2031. The 2016 Private Placement senior notes will carry a weighted average interest rate of 1.82% and
are subject to certain customary covenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain certain   debt-to-EBITDA   (earnings
before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and interest coverage ratios. The proceeds from the first funding of the 2016 Private Placement were used to pay down domestic borrowings under the Company s revolving credit
facility. The proceeds from the second funding of the 2016 Private Placement will be used to pay down a 40 million British pound ($52.1 million at September 30, 2016) 5.99% senior note that is maturing in November 2016 and
provides the Company with additional financial flexibility to support its growth plans, including its successful acquisition strategy.    At
September 30, 2016, total debt, net was $2,154.4 million, compared with $1,938.0 million at December 31, 2015. The debt-to-capital ratio was 39.0% at September 30, 2016, compared with 37.3% at December 31, 2015. The net
debt-to-capital ratio (total debt, net less cash and cash equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders  equity) was 33.6% at September 30, 2016, compared with 32.4% at December 31, 2015. The net debt-to-capital ratio is
presented because the Company is aware that this measure is used by third parties in evaluating the Company.    As a result of all of the
Company s cash flow activities for the first nine months of 2016, cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 totaled $445.5 million, compared with $381.0 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the
Company had $420.5 million in cash outside the United States, compared with $357.2 million at December 31, 2015. The Company utilizes this cash to fund its international operations, as well as to acquire international businesses. In
July 2016, the Company acquired HS Foils and Nu Instruments for approximately $65 million utilizing cash outside the United States. The Company is in compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants, for all of its debt
agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs and
contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.      Contractual Obligations    
 As noted above, the Company completed the 2016 Private Placement in October 2016. As a result of a net increase in long-term borrowings, the
Company s obligation for interest on long-term fixed-rate debt will increase compared to the obligation noted at December 31, 2015. There have been no other material changes to the contractual obligations table presented in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

  Controls and Procedures       The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and
procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our system of disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of September 30,

Exhibit 10.1   
  AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT   
 This  AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  (this   Amendment  ), is made as of October 31, 2016, by
and among (a)  AMETEK, INC. , a Delaware corporation (together with its successors and assigns, the   Company  ), and (b) each of the Noteholders (as defined below) signatory hereto, with respect to that certain Note Purchase
Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2014, (as in effect immediately prior to giving effect to this Amendment, the   Existing Note Agreement   and, as amended pursuant to this Amendment and as may be further amended, restated or
otherwise modified from time to time, the   Note Agreement  ), by and among the Company and each holder of the Notes (collectively, the   Noteholders  ). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Existing Note Agreement.     RECITALS:   
  A.         The Company and the Noteholders are parties to the Existing Note
Agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold the Notes to the Noteholders; and  
  B.         The Company has requested, and the Majority Holders have agreed to,
certain amendments to the provisions of the Existing Note Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.     AGREEMENT:
     NOW THEREFORE,  for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Company and the Majority Holders agree as follows:      

1.  
  AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING NOTE AGREEMENT.       Subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 3 hereof, the Existing Note Agreement is hereby amended by this Amendment as follows:      
   Clause (c) of Section 10.1 of the Existing Note
Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:  
  (c)       Priority Debt  -- Priority Debt at any time to exceed 15%
of Consolidated Total Assets (determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Company); provided, however, that no Lien created pursuant to Section 10.2(j) shall secure Indebtedness owing under the Bank Credit Agreement or
any other note agreement to which the Company is a party unless the Notes are equally and ratably secured by all property subject to such Lien and no Subsidiary shall guaranty or otherwise become obligated in respect of such Indebtedness unless such
Subsidiary guaranties, or becomes obligated in respect of, the Notes, in each case pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Foreign Subsidiary may become a borrower under the Bank
Credit  

Agreement, so long as it is liable only for the amount of its direct borrowings thereunder, and the Company shall not be required to cause such Foreign Subsidiary to guaranty the Notes in
accordance with this clause (c), if (i) no Default or Event of Default exists and is continuing at the time such Foreign Subsidiary becomes a borrower under the Bank Credit Agreement and (ii) at such time the provision by such Foreign Subsidiary of
a guaranty of the Notes would cause the earnings of such Foreign Subsidiary to be treated as a deemed dividend to such Foreign Subsidiary s United States parent under the Code; provided, however, that a guaranty of the Notes from such Foreign
Subsidiary shall be required to be delivered to the holders of Notes in accordance with this clause (c) on the earliest to occur thereafter of (x) a Default or Event of Default or (y) such time as the provision by such Foreign Subsidiary of a
guaranty of the Notes would not cause the earnings of such Foreign Subsidiary to be treated as a deemed dividend to such Foreign Subsidiary s United States parent under the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, (1) any borrowing by a Foreign
Subsidiary under the Bank Credit Agreement shall constitute Priority Debt unless such Foreign Subsidiary shall have provided a guaranty or shall have otherwise become obligated in respect of the Notes in accordance with the terms of this Section
10.1(c), and (2) any Indebtedness owing under the Bank Credit Agreement or any other note agreement to which the Company is a party that is secured by a Lien created pursuant to Section 10.2(j) shall cease to constitute Priority Debt for purposes of
the first sentence of this Section 10.1(c) at such time as the Notes are equally and ratably secured by all property subject to such Lien pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Holders, including,
without limitation, an intercreditor agreement and opinions of counsel to the Company and/or any applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, from counsel reasonably acceptable to the Majority Holders.   

1.2.  
  Accounting Terms; Change in GAAP.       Section 22.6 of the Existing Note
Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:      

22.6  
  Accounting Terms; Change in GAAP.     
 (a)         All accounting terms used herein which are not
expressly defined in this Agreement have the meanings respectively given to them in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all computations made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in accordance with GAAP and
all balance sheets and other financial statements with respect thereto shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, any consolidated financial statement or financial computation shall be done in
accordance with GAAP; and, if at the time that any such statement or computation is required to be made the Company shall not have any Subsidiary, such terms shall mean a financial statement or a financial computation, as the case may be, with
respect to the Company only.    (b)         For purposes of
determining compliance with this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 9, Section 10 and the definition of  Indebtedness ), any election by the Company to measure any financial liability using fair value (as permitted
 
      2  

by Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 825-10-25    Fair Value Option,  International Accounting Standard 39    Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement  or any similar accounting standard) shall be disregarded and such determination shall be made as if such election had not been made.  
 (c)        If the Company shall notify the holders of Notes that the
Company wishes to amend any covenant in Section 10 to eliminate the effect of any change in GAAP on the operation of such covenant (or if the Majority Holders notify the Company that the Majority Holders wish to amend Section 10 for such purpose),
then the Company and the holders of the Notes shall negotiate in good faith to make such adjustments as shall be necessary to eliminate the effect of such change in GAAP on such covenant;  provided  that, until agreement is reached on such
adjustments, the Company s compliance with such covenant shall be determined on the basis of GAAP in effect immediately before the relevant change in GAAP became effective, until either such notice is withdrawn or such covenant is amended in a
manner satisfactory to the Company and the Majority Holders, and the Company shall provide to the holders of Notes, with each certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.2, a reconciliation showing calculations with respect to such covenant before
and after giving effect to such change in GAAP.      

1.3.  
  Definition of  Significant Subsidiary .       The definition of
 Significant Subsidiary  in Schedule B of the Existing Note Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:  
   Significant Subsidiary   means, at any time, each Subsidiary the total assets of which
account for at least 10% of Consolidated Total Assets (determined as of the end of the Company s then most recently ended fiscal quarter) and any two or more Subsidiaries the total assets of which, taken together, represent, on an aggregate
basis, not less than 10% of Consolidated Total Assets (determined as of the end of the Company s then most recently ended fiscal quarter).

thereunder, or (b) to prejudice any rights which any Noteholder now has or may have in the future under or in connection with the Note Agreement or the Notes or under applicable law.

Exhibit 10.2   
  AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT   
 This  AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  (this   Amendment  ), is made as of October 31, 2016, by
and among (a)  AMETEK, INC. , a Delaware corporation (together with its successors and assigns, the   Company  ), and (b) each of the Noteholders (as defined below) signatory hereto, with respect to that certain Note Purchase
Agreement, dated as of August 30, 2007, (as in effect immediately prior to giving effect to this Amendment, the   Existing Note Agreement   and, as amended pursuant to this Amendment and as may be further amended, restated or
otherwise modified from time to time, the   Note Agreement  ), by and among the Company and each holder of the Notes (collectively, the   Noteholders  ). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Existing Note Agreement.     RECITALS:   
  A.         The Company and the Noteholders are parties to the Existing Note
Agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold the Notes to the Noteholders; and     
  B.         The Company has requested, and the Majority Holders have agreed to,
certain amendments to the provisions of the Existing Note Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.     AGREEMENT:
     NOW THEREFORE,  for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Company and the Majority Holders agree as follows:      

1.  
  AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING NOTE AGREEMENT.       Subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 3 hereof, the Existing Note Agreement is hereby amended by this Amendment as follows:      
   Clause (c) of Section 10.1 of the Existing Note
Agreement is hereby amended by amending and restating the first sentence thereof in its entirety to read as follows:  
  Priority Debt at any time to exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets (determined as of the end of the
most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Company); provided, however, that no Lien created pursuant to Section 10.2(j) shall secure Indebtedness owing under the Bank Credit Agreement or any other note agreement to which the Company is a party
unless the Notes are equally and ratably secured by all property subject to such Lien and no Subsidiary shall guaranty or otherwise become obligated in respect of such Indebtedness unless such Subsidiary guaranties, or becomes obligated in respect
of, the Notes, in each case pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Holders.   

1.2.  
  Accounting Terms; Change in GAAP.       Section 22.6 of the Existing Note
Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:      

22.6  
  Accounting Terms; Change in GAAP.     
 (a)          All accounting terms used herein which are not
expressly defined in this Agreement have the meanings respectively given to them in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all computations made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in accordance with GAAP and
all balance sheets and other financial statements with respect thereto shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, any consolidated financial statement or financial computation shall be done in
accordance with GAAP; and, if at the time that any such statement or computation is required to be made the Company shall not have any Subsidiary, such terms shall mean a financial statement or a financial computation, as the case may be, with
respect to the Company only.    (b)        For purposes of
determining compliance with this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 9, Section 10 and the definition of  Indebtedness ), any election by the Company to measure any financial liability using fair value (as permitted by
Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 825-10-25    Fair Value Option,  International Accounting Standard 39    Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement  or any similar
accounting standard) shall be disregarded and such determination shall be made as if such election had not been made.  
 (c)        If the Company shall notify the holders of Notes that the
Company wishes to amend any covenant in Section 10 to eliminate the effect of any change in GAAP on the operation of such covenant (or if the Majority Holders notify the Company that the Majority Holders wish to amend Section 10 for such purpose),
then the Company and the holders of the Notes shall negotiate in good faith to make such adjustments as shall be necessary to eliminate the effect of such change in GAAP on such covenant;  provided  that, until agreement is reached on such
adjustments, the Company s compliance with such covenant shall be determined on the basis of GAAP in effect immediately before the relevant change in GAAP became effective, until either such notice is withdrawn or such covenant is amended in a
manner satisfactory to the Company and the Majority Holders, and the Company shall provide to the holders of Notes, with each certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.2, a reconciliation showing calculations with respect to such covenant before
and after giving effect to such change in GAAP.      

1.3.  
  Definition of  Significant Subsidiary .       The definition of
 Significant Subsidiary  in Schedule B of the Existing Note Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:  
   Significant Subsidiary   means, at any time, each Subsidiary the total assets of which
account for at least 10% of Consolidated Total Assets (determined as of the end of the Company s then most recently ended fiscal quarter) and any two or more Subsidiaries  
      2  

the total assets of which, taken together, represent, on an aggregate basis, not less than 10% of Consolidated Total Assets (determined as of the end of the Company s then most recently
ended fiscal quarter).      

2.  
  WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS.       To induce the Majority Holders to
enter into this Amendment, the Company represents and warrants to each of the Noteholders that as of the Second Amendment Effective Date:      

2.1.  
  Corporate and Other Organization and Authority.       The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Amendment and to perform its obligations hereunder and under the Note
Agreement.      
   This Amendment has been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. Each of this Amendment and the Note Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by:   (a)        applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally and 
 (b)        general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).      
   The execution and delivery by the Company of this
Amendment and the performance by the Company of its obligations under each of this Amendment and the Note Agreement do not conflict with, result in any breach in any of the provisions of, constitute a default under, violate or result in the creation
of any Lien upon any property of the Company under the provisions of:  
 (a)        any charter document, constitutive document, agreement with
shareholders or members, bylaws or any other organizational or governing agreement of the Company;  
 (b)        any agreement, instrument or conveyance by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties may be bound or affected; or  
 (c)        any statute, rule or regulation or any order, judgment or
award of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties may be bound or affected.  
      3  

2.4.  
  Governmental Consent.       The execution and delivery by the Company of
this Amendment and the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and under the Note Agreement do not require any consents, approvals or authorizations of, or filings, registrations or qualifications with, any Governmental Authority on
the part of the Company.      
   No event has occurred and is continuing and no condition
exists which, immediately before or immediately after giving effect to the amendments provided for in this Amendment, constitutes or would constitute a Default or an Event of Default.  
   
   Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates is
paying any fee or giving any other consideration for the execution and delivery of the amendments to other note agreements to which it is a party, which are similar to this Amendment.  

3.  
  CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVENESS OF AMENDMENTS.       The amendments of the
Existing Note Agreement as set forth in this Amendment shall become effective as of the date first written above (the   Second Amendment Effective Date  ),  provided  that each of the following conditions shall have been
satisfied:    (a)        each Noteholder shall have received a fully executed copy
of this Amendment executed by the Company and the Majority Holders;   (b)        the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2 of this Amendment shall be true and correct on and as of the Second Amendment Effective Date; and 
 (c)        the Company shall have paid all reasonable fees, charges and disbursements
of counsel to the Noteholders incurred in connection with this Amendment and the transactions contemplated hereby.     

4.  
  MISCELLANEOUS.         
    THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK EXCLUDING CHOICE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW OF SUCH STATE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER
THAN SUCH STATE.   
      4  

4.2.  
  Duplicate Originals; Electronic Signature.       Two or more duplicate
originals of this Amendment may be signed by the parties, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts and shall be effective
when at least one counterpart shall have been executed by each party hereto, and each set of counterparts that, collectively, show execution by each party hereto shall constitute one duplicate original. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to this Amendment by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment.      

4.3.  
  Waiver and Amendments.       Neither this Amendment nor any term hereof may
be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, or by any action or inaction, but only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties signatory hereto.      
   Whether or not the amendments contemplated by this
Amendment become effective, the Company confirms its obligation under Section 15.1 of the Note Agreement and agrees that, on the Second Amendment Effective Date (or if an invoice is delivered subsequent to the Second Amendment Effective Date or if
such amendments do not become effective, promptly after receiving any statement or invoice therefor), it will pay all costs and expenses of the Noteholders relating to this Amendment, including, but not limited to, the statement for reasonable fees
and disbursements of the Noteholders  special counsel presented to the Company at least one Business Day prior to the Second Amendment Effective Date. The Company will also promptly pay, upon receipt thereof, each additional statement for
reasonable fees and disbursements of the Noteholders  special counsel rendered after the Second Amendment Effective Date in connection with this Amendment.     

4.5.  
  Successors and Assigns.       This Amendment shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties hereto. The provisions hereof are intended to be for the benefit of the Noteholders and shall be enforceable by any successor or assign of any such Noteholder, whether or not
an express assignment of rights hereunder shall have been made by such Noteholder or its successors and assigns.      
   All warranties, representations, certifications and
covenants made by the Company in this Amendment shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Noteholders and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Amendment, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Noteholders.
 
      5  

4.7.  
  Part of Existing Note Agreement; Future References, etc.       This
Amendment shall be construed in connection with and as a part of the Note Agreement and, except as expressly amended by this Amendment, all terms, conditions and covenants contained in the Existing Note Agreement are hereby ratified and shall be and
remain in full force and effect. Any and all notices, requests, certificates and other instruments executed and delivered after the execution and delivery of this Amendment may refer to the Existing Note Agreement without making specific
reference to this Amendment, but nevertheless all such references shall include this Amendment, unless the context otherwise requires.     

4.8.  
  Affirmation of Obligations under Existing Note Agreement and Notes; No Novation.    
 Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, this Amendment is not intended to and shall not serve to effect a
novation of the obligations under the Existing Note Agreement. Instead, it is the express intention of the parties hereto to reaffirm the indebtedness created under the Existing Note Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, and the
Notes. The Company hereby acknowledges and affirms all of its respective obligations under the terms of the Existing Note Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, and the Notes. The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment
shall not be deemed, except as expressly provided herein, (a) to operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of any of the Noteholders under the Existing Note Agreement or the Notes, nor constitute a waiver or amendment of any provision
thereunder, or (b) to prejudice any rights which any Noteholder now has or may have in the future under or in connection with the Note Agreement or the Notes or under applicable law.

Exhibit 10.3   
  AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT   
 This  AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  (this   Amendment  ), is made as of October 31, 2016, by
and among (a)  AMETEK, INC. , a Delaware corporation (together with its successors and assigns, the   Company  ), and (b) each of the Noteholders (as defined below) signatory hereto, with respect to that certain Note Purchase
Agreement, dated as of September 17, 2008, (as in effect immediately prior to giving effect to this Amendment, the   Existing Note Agreement   and, as amended pursuant to this Amendment and as may be further amended, restated or
otherwise modified from time to time, the   Note Agreement  ), by and among the Company and each holder of the Notes (collectively, the   Noteholders  ). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Existing Note Agreement.     RECITALS:   
  A.         The Company and the Noteholders are parties to the Existing Note
Agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold the Notes to the Noteholders; and  
  B.         The Company has requested, and the Majority Holders have agreed to,
certain amendments to the provisions of the Existing Note Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.     AGREEMENT:
     NOW THEREFORE,  for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Company and the Majority Holders agree as follows:      

1.  
  AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING NOTE AGREEMENT.       Subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 3 hereof, the Existing Note Agreement is hereby amended by this Amendment as follows:      
   Clause (c) of Section 10.1 of the Existing Note
Agreement is hereby amended by amending and restating the first sentence thereof in its entirety to read as follows:  
  Priority Debt at any time to exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets (determined as of the end of the
most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Company); provided, however, that no Lien created pursuant to Section 10.2(j) shall secure Indebtedness owing under the Bank Credit Agreement or any other note agreement to which the Company is a party
unless the Notes are equally and ratably secured by all property subject to such Lien and no Subsidiary shall guaranty or otherwise become obligated in respect of such Indebtedness unless such Subsidiary guaranties, or becomes obligated in respect
of, the Notes, in each case pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Holders.   

1.2.  
  Accounting Terms; Change in GAAP.       Section 22.6 of the Existing Note
Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:      

22.6  
  Accounting Terms; Change in GAAP.     
 (a)            All accounting terms used herein
which are not expressly defined in this Agreement have the meanings respectively given to them in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all computations made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in accordance
with GAAP and all balance sheets and other financial statements with respect thereto shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, any consolidated financial statement or financial computation shall be
done in accordance with GAAP; and, if at the time that any such statement or computation is required to be made the Company shall not have any Subsidiary, such terms shall mean a financial statement or a financial computation, as the case may be,
with respect to the Company only.    (b)          For
purposes of determining compliance with this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 9, Section 10 and the definition of  Indebtedness ), any election by the Company to measure any financial liability using fair value (as
permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 825-10-25    Fair Value Option,  International Accounting Standard 39    Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement  or any
similar accounting standard) shall be disregarded and such determination shall be made as if such election had not been made.  
 (c)          If the Company shall notify the holders of
Notes that the Company wishes to amend any covenant in Section 10 to eliminate the effect of any change in GAAP on the operation of such covenant (or if the Majority Holders notify the Company that the Majority Holders wish to amend Section 10 for
such purpose), then the Company and the holders of the Notes shall negotiate in good faith to make such adjustments as shall be necessary to eliminate the effect of such change in GAAP on such covenant;  provided  that, until agreement is
reached on such adjustments, the Company s compliance with such covenant shall be determined on the basis of GAAP in effect immediately before the relevant change in GAAP became effective, until either such notice is withdrawn or such covenant

   This Amendment has been duly authorized by all

enforceability may be limited by:   (a)        applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors  rights generally and 
 (b)        general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

      3  

2.4.  
  Governmental Consent.       The execution and delivery by the Company of
this Amendment and the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and under the Note Agreement do not require any consents, approvals or authorizations of, or filings, registrations or qualifications with, any Governmental Authority on
the part of the Company.      
   No event has occurred and is continuing and no condition
exists which, immediately before or immediately after giving effect to the amendments provided for in this Amendment, constitutes or would constitute a Default or an Event of Default.  
   
   Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates is
paying any fee or giving any other consideration for the execution and delivery of the amendments to other note agreements to which it is a party, which are similar to this Amendment.

  Part of Existing Note Agreement; Future References, etc.       This
Amendment shall be construed in connection with and as a part of the Note Agreement and, except as expressly amended by this Amendment, all terms, conditions and covenants contained in the Existing Note Agreement are hereby ratified and shall be and
remain in full force and effect. Any and all notices, requests, certificates and other instruments executed and delivered after the execution and delivery of this Amendment may refer to the Existing Note Agreement without making specific

4.8.  
  Affirmation of Obligations under Existing Note Agreement and Notes; No Novation.    
 Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, this Amendment is not intended to and shall not serve to effect a
novation of the obligations under the Existing Note Agreement. Instead, it is the express intention of the parties hereto to reaffirm the indebtedness created under the Existing Note Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, and the
Notes. The Company hereby acknowledges and affirms all of its respective obligations under the terms of the Existing Note Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, and the Notes. The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment
shall not be deemed, except as expressly provided herein, (a) to operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of any of the Noteholders under the Existing Note Agreement or the Notes, nor constitute a waiver or amendment of any provision
thereunder, or (b) to prejudice any rights which any Noteholder now has or may have in the future under or in connection with the Note Agreement or the Notes or under applicable law.
