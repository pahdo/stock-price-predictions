1. 
    Nature of Operations 
     Our company, VCA Inc. ( VCA ) is a Delaware corporation formed in 1986 and is based in Los Angeles, California. We are an animal healthcare company with the following   four   operating segments: animal hospitals ("Animal Hospital"), veterinary diagnostic laboratories ("Laboratory"), veterinary medical technology ("Medical Technology"), and Camp Bow Wow Franchising, Inc. (f/k/a D.O.G. Enterprises, LLC ("Camp Bow Wow").  Our operating segments are aggregated into   two   reportable segments: Animal Hospital and Laboratory.  Our Medical Technology and Camp Bow Wow operating segments are combined in our All Other category. See   Note 10  ,   Lines of Business   within these notes to unaudited condensed, consolidated financial statements. 
  Our Animal Hospitals offer a full range of general medical and surgical services for companion animals. Our Animal Hospitals treat diseases and injuries, provide pharmaceutical products and perform a variety of pet-wellness programs, including health examinations, diagnostic testing, vaccinations, spaying, neutering and dental care. At   September 30, 2016  , we operated or managed   776   animal hospitals throughout   43   states and   five   Canadian provinces. 
  We operate a full-service veterinary diagnostic laboratory network serving all   50   states and certain areas in Canada. Our Laboratory network provides sophisticated testing and consulting services used by veterinarians in the detection, diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, treatment and prevention of diseases and other conditions affecting animals. At   September 30, 2016  , we operated   60   laboratories of various sizes located strategically throughout the United States and Canada. 
  Our Medical Technology business sells digital radiography and ultrasound imaging equipment, provides education and training on the use of that equipment, provides consulting and mobile imaging services, and sells software and ancillary services to the veterinary market. 
  Our Camp Bow Wow business franchises a premier provider of pet services including dog day care, overnight boarding, grooming and other ancillary services at specially designed pet care facilities, principally under the trademark Camp Bow Wow       .  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   128   Camp Bow Wow franchise locations operating in   34   states and   one   Canadian province.  
  On December 31, 2015, our company sold substantially all of the assets of Vetstreet Inc. ("Vetstreet") to a subsidiary of Henry Schein, Inc.. Concurrent with the sale of Vetstreet, we purchased a   19.9%   interest in the continuing Vetstreet business. Prior to the sale of Vetstreet, its results of operations were included in our "All Other" category. 
  On   May 1, 2016  , we acquired an   80%   ownership interest in Companion Animal Practices, North America ("CAPNA"). CAPNA, founded in   2010  , and at the time of acquisition, operated a network of   56   free standing animal hospitals in   18   states. CAPNA's results of operations are included in our Animal Hospital segment. 
  The practice of veterinary medicine is subject to seasonal fluctuation. In particular, demand for veterinary services is significantly higher during the warmer months because pets spend a greater amount of time outdoors where they are more likely to be injured and are more susceptible to disease and parasites. In addition, use of veterinary services may be affected by levels of flea infestation, heartworms and ticks, and the number of daylight hours. 

2. 
    Basis of Presentation 
     Our accompanying unaudited, condensed, consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements as permitted under applicable rules and regulations.  In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  The results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  . The year end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. For further information, refer to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Basis of Presentation, continued 
       
  The preparation of our condensed, consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed, consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

    Animal Hospital and Laboratory Acquisitions 
  The purchase price allocations for some of the 2016 animal hospital acquisitions included in the table below are preliminary; however, adjustments, if any, are not expected to be material. The measurement periods for purchase price allocations do not exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the aggregate consideration for our independent animal hospitals and labs acquired during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, (in thousands): 

____________________________ 
    
            (1)   
    Identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships, trademarks and covenants-not-to-compete. The weighted-average amortization period for the total identifiable intangible assets is approximately   five   years. The weighted-average amortization period for customer relationships, trademarks and covenants is approximately   five   years,   six   years and   five   years, respectively. 

Included in the table above is Antech Diagnostics, Inc.'s March 31, 2015 acquisition of Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratory ("AVRL") for total consideration of   $21.0 million  .

    Acquisitions, continued 
       
    CAPNA Acquisition 
  On   May 1, 2016  , we acquired an   80%   ownership interest in CAPNA for a purchase price of $  350.4   million. CAPNA, founded in   2010  , and at the time of its acquisition, operated a network of   56   free standing animal hospitals in   18   states.  
    
  The following table summarizes the purchase price and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price (in thousands): 

____________________________ 
    
            (1)     
    Identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, trademarks and covenants-not-to-compete. The weighted-average amortization period for the total identifiable intangible assets is approximately   seven   years. The amortization periods for customer relationships, trademarks and covenants is   seven   years,   five   years and   five   years, respectively. 
       
            (2)     
    As of September 30, 2016, we expect that   $265.8   million of goodwill recorded for this acquisition will be deductible for income tax purposes.  
       
  The purchase price allocation for CAPNA is preliminary and is pending the valuation of certain items including, but not limited to, capital leases, operating leases, deferred income taxes and the noncontrolling interest. The final valuation of the net assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest is expected to be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the date of acquisition. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, significant measurement period adjustments included the finalization of the valuation of intangible assets, the recording of the preliminary deferred income tax adjustment, as well as the true-up of the noncontrolling interest. 
    
         Pro Forma Information  
  The following pro forma financial information for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   presents (i) the actual results of operations of our   2016   acquisitions and (ii) the combined results of operations for our company and our   2016   acquisitions as if those acquisitions had been completed on July 1,   2015   and January 1,   2015  , the first day of the comparable prior reporting periods, respectively. The pro forma financial information considers principally (i) our company s financial results, (ii) the historical financial results of our acquisitions, and (iii) select pro forma adjustments to the historical

The pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our consolidated results of operations would have been had we completed the acquisition at the beginning of the comparable prior reporting periods.  
    
            In addition, the pro forma financial information does not attempt to project the future results of operations of our company:

    Long-Term Obligations  
     New Senior Credit Facility 
    
  On   June 29, 2016  , we entered into a new senior credit facility with various lenders for approximately   $1.7 billion   of senior secured credit facilities with Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent, swingline lender and Letter of Credit issuer, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Suntrust Bank, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents (the "New Senior Credit Facility"). The New Senior Credit Facility replaced our previous senior credit facility which provided for   $600 million   of term notes and an   $800 million   revolving credit facility. The New Senior Credit Facility provides for   $880 million   of senior secured term notes and an   $800 million   senior secured revolving facility, which may be used to borrow, on a same-day notice under a swing line, the lesser of   $25 million   and the aggregate unused amount of the revolving credit facility then in effect. In addition to refinancing all outstanding amounts under our previous senior credit facility, borrowings under our New Senior Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purchases, including permitted share repurchases. At   June 30, 2016  , we had   $375 million   in outstanding borrowings under the new senior secured revolving facility, which funds were used together with the proceeds from the   $880 million   of new senior secured term notes to refinance amounts outstanding under our previous senior credit facility.   
    
  In connection with the New Senior Credit Facility, we incurred   $3.8 million   in financing costs, of which approximately   $3.2 million   were capitalized as deferred financing costs.  The remaining   $0.6 million   of financing costs were expensed as debt retirement costs, along with an additional   $1.0 million   of previously capitalized deferred financing costs associated with lenders under our previous senior credit facility who are not lenders under our New Senior Credit Facility. 
    
  During the current fiscal year, ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 were adopted. In accordance with ASU 2015-03, the table below presents debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the face amount of the corresponding notes in the current period and retrospectively in the prior fiscal year end.

    Long-Term Obligations, continued 
       
  Long-term obligations consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

____________________________ 
     
  Interest Rate.   In general, borrowings under the New Senior Credit Facility (including swing line borrowings) bear interest, at our option, on either: 

the base rate (as defined below) plus the applicable margin of   0.75%   (Pricing Tier 2, see table below) per annum; or 

the Eurodollar rate (as defined below), plus a margin of   1.75%   (Pricing Tier 2, see table below) per annum 
       
  Each of the aforementioned margins remain applicable until the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and the financial statements, for the period ended   September 30, 2016  , at which time the applicable margin will be determined by reference to the leverage ratio in effect from time to time as set forth in the following table:

  Notes to Condensed, Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

6. 
    Long-Term Obligations, continued 

The base rate for the senior term notes is a rate per annum equal to the highest of the (a) Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (b) Bank of America, N.A.'s ("Bank of America") prime rate in effect on such day, and (c) the Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%. The Eurodollar rate is defined as the rate per annum equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), or a comparable or successor rate which is approved by Bank of America.      
    
  Maturity and Principal Payments.   The senior term notes mature on   June 29, 2021  . Principal payments on the senior term notes of   $5.5 million   are due each calendar quarter from   September 30, 2016   to and including   June 30, 2017  ,   $11.0 million   are due each calendar quarter from   September 30, 2017   to and including   June 30, 2019  ,   $16.5 million   are due each calendar quarter from   September 30, 2019   to and including   June 30, 2020   and   $22.0 million   are due each calendar quarter thereafter with a final payment of the outstanding principal balance due upon maturity. 
    
  The revolving credit facility has a per annum commitment fee determined by reference to the Leverage Ratio in effect from time to time and is applied to the unused portion of the commitment. The revolving credit facility matures on   June 29, 2021  . Principal payments on the revolving credit facility are made at our discretion with the entire unpaid amount due at maturity. At   September 30, 2016  , we had borrowings of   $340.0 million   under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  The following table sets forth the scheduled principal payments for our senior credit facility (in thousands): 

Guarantees and Security.   We and each of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries guarantee the outstanding indebtedness under the New Senior Credit Facility.  Any borrowings, along with the guarantees of the domestic subsidiaries, are further secured by a pledge of substantially all of our consolidated assets, including   65%   of the voting equity and   100%   of the non-voting equity interest in each of our foreign subsidiaries.  
    
  Debt Covenants.   The New Senior Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants pertaining to interest coverage and leverage ratios.  In addition, the New Senior Credit Facility has restrictions pertaining to the payment of cash dividends on all classes of stock.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a interest coverage ratio of   16.88   to 1.00, which was in compliance with the required ratio of no less than   3.00   to 1.00, and a leverage ratio of   2.58   to 1.00, which was in compliance with the required ratio of no more than   4.00   to 1.00.

    Fair Value 

Current fair value accounting guidance includes a hierarchy that is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity s pricing based upon their own market assumptions. The current guidance establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

    Fair Value, continued 

Level 1.      Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level 2.      Inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and 

Level 3.      Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 
       
  Non-Recurring Financial Measurements 
    
  Non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial assets depend on the type of asset and are accounted for in accordance with FASB s guidance on fair value measurement. During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes to our non-recurring fair value measurements. 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The FASB accounting guidance requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Fair value as defined by the guidance is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value estimates of financial instruments are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we might pay or receive in actual market transactions. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents.      These balances include cash and cash equivalents with maturities of less than three months. The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
    
  Receivables, Less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Accounts Payable and Certain Other Accrued Liabilities.      Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value. 
    
  Long-Term Debt.      The fair value of debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is based upon the ask price quoted from an external source, which is considered a Level 2 input. 
    
  The following table reflects the carrying value and fair value of our variable-rate long-term debt (in thousands):

  Nonvested Stock Activity 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we granted   122,733   shares of nonvested common stock to our directors and our non-executive employees. In April 2016 we granted   4,992   of these shares to our directors. Assuming continued service through each vesting date, the awards granted to our directors will vest in three equal annual installments beginning April 2017 to April 2019.

Restricted Stock Unit Activity 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we granted   228,202   performance based restricted stock units ("RSUs") to our executive and non executive officers representing the right to receive   one   share of common stock. These RSUs will be earned upon the achievement of applicable performance criteria during the performance periods, from fiscal period 2016 to 2019, as set forth in the 2016 equity performance award agreements. Assuming achievement of the required performance conditions and continued service through each vesting date, these awards will further vest in four equal annual installments on the later to occur of the certification of the applicable results or the annual anniversary of the grant date.

    Calculation of Earnings per Share 
     Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to VCA Inc. by the weighted- average number of common shares outstanding, after giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Our Animal Hospital and Laboratory business segments are each considered reportable segments in accordance with the FASB's guidance related to Segment Reporting. Our Animal Hospital segment provides veterinary services for companion animals and sells related retail and pharmaceutical products. Our Laboratory segment provides diagnostic laboratory testing services for veterinarians, both associated with our animal hospitals and those independent of us. Our other operating segments included in the  All Other  category in the following tables are our Medical Technology business, which sells digital radiography and ultrasound imaging equipment, related computer hardware, software and ancillary services to the veterinary market, and our Camp Bow Wow business, which primarily franchises a premier provider of pet services including dog day care, overnight boarding, grooming and other ancillary services at specially designed pet care facilities. These operating segments do not meet the quantitative requirements for reportable segments. Our operating segments are strategic business units that have different services, products and/or functions. The segments are managed separately because each is a distinct and different business venture with unique challenges, risks and rewards. We also operate a corporate office that provides general and administrative support services for each of our segments.  
  The accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross profit and operating income. For purposes of reviewing the operating performance of our segments, all intercompany sales and purchases are generally accounted for as if they were transactions with independent third parties at current market prices.

    Commitments and Contingencies 
       
  We have certain commitments including operating leases, purchase agreements and acquisition agreements. These items are discussed in detail in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also have contingencies as follows: 
    
           a. 
    Earn-Out Payments 
       
  We have contractual arrangements in connection with certain acquisitions, whereby additional cash may be paid to former owners of acquired companies upon fulfillment of specified financial criteria as set forth in the respective agreements. The amount to be paid cannot be determined until the earn-out periods have expired. If the specified financial criteria are satisfied, we will be obligated to pay an additional $  8.5 million  .  
  In accordance with business combination accounting guidance, contingent consideration, such as earn-outs, are recognized as part of the consideration transferred on the acquisition date. A liability is initially recorded based upon its acquisition date fair value. The changes in fair value are recognized in earnings where applicable for each reporting period.   The fair value is determined using a contractually stated formula using either a multiple of revenue or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"). The formulas used to determine the estimated fair value are Level 3 inputs. The changes in fair value were immaterial to our condensed, consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. We recorded   $6.6 million   and $  3.5 million   in earn-out liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which are included in other accrued liabilities in our condensed, consolidated balance sheets. 
    
           b. 
    Legal Proceedings 
       
  On May 29, 2013, a former veterinary assistant at one of our animal hospitals filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, titled Jorge Duran vs. VCA Animal Hospitals, Inc., et. al.  The lawsuit seeks to assert claims on behalf of current and former veterinary assistants employed by us in California, and alleges, among other allegations, that we improperly failed to pay regular and overtime wages, improperly failed to provide proper meal and rest periods, and engaged in unfair business practices.  The lawsuit seeks damages, statutory penalties, and other relief, including attorneys  fees and costs.  On May 7, 2014, we obtained partial summary judgment, dismissing   four   of   eight   claims of the complaint, including the claims for failure to pay regular and overtime wages.  On January 9, 2014, Plaintiff Duran moved to certify a meal period premium class, a rest period premium class and a class under California s Business and Professions Code   17200   et seq.,   On June 24, 2015, the Court denied Plaintiff s Motion.  Plaintiff is now pursuing his representative claims under the seventh cause of action (Private Attorneys General Act or  PAGA). We intend to continue to vigorously defend against the remaining claim in this action.  At this time, we are unable to estimate the reasonable possible loss or range of possible loss, but do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position taken as a whole. 
  On July 16, 2014,   two   additional former veterinary assistants filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, titled La Kimba Bradsbery and Cheri Brakensiek vs. Vicar Operating, Inc., et. al. The lawsuit seeks to assert claims on behalf of current and former veterinary assistants, kennel assistants, and client service representatives employed by us in California, and alleges, among other allegations, that we improperly failed to pay regular and overtime wages, improperly failed to provide proper meal and rest periods, improperly failed to pay reporting time pay, improperly failed to reimburse for certain business-related expenses, and engaged in unfair business practices. The lawsuit seeks damages, statutory penalties, and other relief, including attorneys  fees and costs.  In September 2014, the court issued an order staying the La Kimba Bradsbery lawsuit, which stay remains in place. On or about August 23, 2016, the Court lifted the stay and discovery is proceeding. We intend to vigorously defend against the Bradsbery action. At this time, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of possible loss, but do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position taken as a whole. 
  On July 12, 2013, an individual who provided courier services with respect to our laboratory clients in California filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Santa Clara - San Jose Branch, titled Carlos Lopez vs. Logistics Delivery Solutions, LLC, Antech Diagnostics, Inc., et. al.  Logistics Delivery Solutions, LLC, a co-defendant in the lawsuit, is a company with which Antech has contracted to provide courier services in California. The lawsuit sought to assert claims on behalf of individuals who were engaged by Logistics Delivery Solutions, LLC to perform such courier services and alleges, among other allegations, that Logistics Delivery Solutions and Antech

     Diagnostics improperly classified the plaintiffs as independent contractors, improperly failed to pay overtime wages, and improperly failed to provide proper meal periods. The lawsuit sought damages, statutory penalties, and other relief, including attorneys' fees and costs. The parties agreed to settle the action, on a class-wide basis, for an amount not to exceed   $1,250,000  . Logistics Delivery Solutions, LLC, has agreed to pay half of the claim. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2016, we have accrued the remaining   fifty   percent. The settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or acceptance of fault by any of the defendants named in the complaint.  Antech Diagnostics and Logistics Delivery Solutions agreed to the settlement to eliminate the uncertainties, risk, distraction and expense associated with protracted litigation.  The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on November 30, 2015 and issued an order granting final approval of the settlement on March 25, 2016.  On April 11, 2016, the Court entered the Judgment approving the settlement and the judgment went into effect on June 1, 2016.  The final settlement amount was approximately   $900,000  , half of which was paid by DSA pursuant to our agreement.  Payments to class members were made in early July 2016 and this matter is now closed. 
  On May 12, 2014, an individual client who purchased goods and services from one of our animal hospitals filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, titled Tony M. Graham vs. VCA Antech, Inc. and VCA Animal Hospitals, Inc. The lawsuit sought to assert claims on behalf of the plaintiff and other individuals who purchased similar goods and services from our animal hospitals and alleged, among other allegations, that we improperly charged such individuals for  biohazard waste management  in connection with the services performed.  The lawsuit sought compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts, and other relief, including attorneys' fees and costs. VCA successfully had the venue transferred to the Southern District of California. Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification on February 12, 2016. In late July 2016, VCA had filed a Summary Judgment Motion. The Honorable Christina Snyder issued her decision on September 12, 2016, denying Plaintiffs  motion for class certification and granting Defendants  summary judgment motion. Plaintiff in this action filed an appeal of this judgment in October 2016. We intend to continue to vigorously defend this action.  
  In addition to the lawsuits described above, we are party to ordinary routine legal proceedings and claims incidental to our business, but we are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

    Noncontrolling Interests 
     We own some of our animal hospitals in partnerships with noncontrolling interest holders. We consolidate our partnerships in our condensed, consolidated financial statements because our ownership interest in these partnerships is equal to or greater than   50.1%   and we control these entities. We record noncontrolling interest in income of subsidiaries equal to our partners  percentage ownership of the partnerships  income. We also record changes in the redemption value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our condensed, consolidated statements of income. We reflect our noncontrolling partners  cumulative share in the equity of the respective partnerships as either noncontrolling interests in equity, mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests in other liabilities, or redeemable noncontrolling interests in temporary equity (mezzanine) in our condensed, consolidated balance sheets. 
    
           a.   
    Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
     The terms of some of our partnership agreements require us to purchase the partner s equity in the partnership in the event of the partner s death. We report these redeemable noncontrolling interests at their estimated redemption value, which approximates fair value, and classify them as liabilities due to the certainty of the related event. Estimated redemption value is determined using either a contractually stated formula or a discounted cash flow technique, both of which are used as an approximation of fair value. The discounted cash flow inputs used to determine the redemption value are Level 3 and include forecasted growth rates, valuation multiples, and the weighted average cost of capital. We recognize changes in the obligation as interest cost in our condensed, consolidated statements of income. 
    
  The following table provides a summary of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests included in other liabilities in our condensed, consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
       
  In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-17,    Consolidation (Topic 810)     Interests held through Related Parties That are under Common Control,     to amend the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the reporting entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE and, therefore, consolidates the VIE. A reporting entity has an indirect interest in a VIE if it has a direct interest in a related party that, in turn, has a direct interest in the VIE. The effective date and transition requirements of this ASU for public entities are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  Since this update is related to ASU 2015-02,    Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,    the amendments should be applied retrospectively if ASU 2015-02 has already been adopted. If not, amendments of both these ASUs should be adopted at the same time, with the same transition method elected for ASU 2015-02. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,    Income Taxes (Topic 710) Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,    to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. While current GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party, this ASU requires the entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments in this Update are part of the Board s Simplification initiative and align the recognition of income tax consequences for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The effective date and transition requirements of this ASU for public entities are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted.  The amendments should be applied using a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):     Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,    to provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues where current GAAP is unclear or does not have specific guidance. The cash flow issues covered by this ASU are: 1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; 2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; 3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination;  4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims;  5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; 6) distributions received from equity method investees; 7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and 8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  The effective date and transition requirements of this ASU for public entities are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted.  The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,    to improve the guidance on Topic 606 in assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The effective date and transition requirements of this ASU are the same as ASU 2014-09. Since the effective date of ASU 2014-09 was deferred by ASU 2015-14 by one year, ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-10 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted only as of annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.

The effective date and transition requirements of this ASU are the same as ASU 2014-09. Since the effective date of ASU 2014-09 was deferred by ASU 2015-14 by one year, ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-10 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted only as of annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,    as part of the Board s Simplification Initiative.  The areas for simplification in this Update involves several aspects of share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).    The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09  , "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"   which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Update 2014-09.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,    Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.    The amendments in this Update eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments in this Update require that an entity that  
  has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier adoption is permitted. No additional disclosures are required at transition. We do not expect this adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases (Topic 842) Section A-Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification  Section B-Conforming Amendments Related to Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification  Section C-Background Information and Basis for Conclusions.    The amendments in this Update affect any entity that enters into a lease with some specified scope exemptions and supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The main difference between previous GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP which did not require lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases. The lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases should be recognized in the statement of financial position. A lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. When measuring

  assets and liabilities arising from a lease, a lessee (and a lessor) should include payments to be made in optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. 
  The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,    Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.    An entity should present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk if the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. For public business entities, this Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect this adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Introduction 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed, consolidated financial statements provided under Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have included herein statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We generally identify forward-looking statements in this report using words like  believe,   intend,   expect,   estimate,   may,   plan,   should plan,   project,   contemplate,   anticipate,   predict,   potential,   continue,  or similar expressions. You may find some of these statements below and elsewhere in this report. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts and are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this report may turn out to be incorrect. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in our discussion in this report will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may vary materially. Factors that may cause our plans, expectations, future financial condition and results to change are described throughout this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in  Risk Factors,  Part I, Item 1A of that report. 
  The forward-looking information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is as of   November 7, 2016  , and we undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law. Shareholders and prospective investors can find information filed with the SEC after   November 7, 2016   at our website at   http://investor.vca.com   or at the SEC s website at   www.sec.gov  . 
  We are a leading North American animal healthcare company. We provide veterinary services and diagnostic testing services to support veterinary care and we sell diagnostic imaging equipment and other medical technology products and related services to veterinarians. We also franchise a premier provider of pet services including dog day care, overnight boarding, grooming and other ancillary services at specially designed pet care facilities. 
  Our reportable segments are as follows:    
             
    Our Animal Hospital segment operates the largest network of freestanding, full-service animal hospitals in the nation. Our animal hospitals offer a full range of general medical and surgical services for companion animals. We treat diseases and injuries, offer pharmaceutical and retail products and perform a variety of pet wellness programs, including health examinations, diagnostic testing, routine vaccinations, spaying, neutering and dental care.  At   September 30, 2016  , our animal hospital network consisted of   776   animal hospitals in   43   states and in   five   Canadian provinces. 
                
    Our Laboratory segment operates the largest network of veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the nation. Our laboratories provide sophisticated testing and consulting services used by veterinarians in the detection, diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, treatment and prevention of diseases and other conditions affecting animals. At   September 30, 2016  , our laboratory network consisted of   60   laboratories serving all   50   states and certain areas in Canada. 
     For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , our  All Other  category includes the results of our Medical Technology and Camp Bow Wow operating segments. For the comparable prior periods in 2015, our "All Other" category included the results of operations of our Vetstreet operating segment, which we sold in December 2015. Each of these segments did not meet the materiality thresholds to be considered reportable segments. 
  The practice of veterinary medicine is subject to seasonal fluctuation. In particular, demand for veterinary services is significantly higher during the warmer months because pets spend a greater amount of time outdoors where they are more likely to be injured and are more susceptible to disease and parasites. In addition, use of veterinary services may be affected by levels of flea infestation, heartworms and ticks, and the number of daylight hours.

Use of Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  In this management's discussion and analysis, we use supplemental measures of our performance, which are derived from our consolidated financial information, but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). These financial measures, which are considered  Non-GAAP financial measures  under SEC rules, include our Non-GAAP gross profit and our Non-GAAP gross margin on a consolidated basis for our Animal Hospital segment, and the same measures expressed on a same-store basis.  Additionally, our Non-GAAP financial measures also include our Non-GAAP SG A, our Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating margin on a consolidated basis. Lastly, our Non-GAAP financial measures also include our Non-GAAP consolidated net income and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.  See   Consolidated Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures   below for information about our use of these Non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures, material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures, and a reconciliation of each Non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  
  Executive Overview 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we experienced increases in consolidated revenue, gross profit and operating income. The increases were primarily driven by revenue from our acquisitions and organic growth in our Animal Hospital and Laboratory segments. Our Animal Hospital same-store revenue increased   5.4%   and   6.5%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Our Laboratory internal revenue increased   5.5%   and   6.6%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Our consolidated operating income increased   10.2%   and   17.4%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Our consolidated operating margin decreased by 130 basis points and remained flat for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Our Non-GAAP consolidated operating income, which excludes the impact of intangible asset amortization associated with acquisitions, and other discrete items, increased   19.8%   and   22.8%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.  Our Non-GAAP consolidated operating margins increased by 10 basis points and 80 basis points for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in Non-GAAP consolidated operating income was primarily due to improved results from our Animal Hospital and Laboratory business segments.  
  Share Repurchase Program 
  In April 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase for up to   $125 million   of our common shares, which was completed in August 2014.  In August 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the continuance of that share repurchase program, authorizing us to repurchase up to an additional   $400 million   of our common shares.  These repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, pursuant to trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, through privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchases.  The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, capital availability, legal requirements and economic and market conditions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had repurchased   $298.9 million   of our common shares pursuant to our current share repurchase program. Accordingly,   $101.1 million   remains available for future repurchases. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the repurchase program, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , no share repurchases were made since we elected to deploy our capital to fund acquisitions. Our share repurchase program has no expiration date. The repurchases have been and will continue to be funded by existing cash balances and by our revolving credit facility. Refer to   Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and the Use of Proceeds   in Part II of this report. 
  Recent Developments 
  On   May 1, 2016  , we acquired an   80%   ownership interest in CAPNA for approximately $  350.4   million. CAPNA, founded in   2010  , and operated at the time of its acquisition, a network of   56   free standing animal hospitals in   18   states.  
  On   June 29, 2016  , we entered into a new senior credit facility with various lenders for approximately   $1.7 billion   of senior secured credit facilities. The New Senior Credit Facility replaced our previous senior credit facility which provided for   $600 million   of term notes and a   $800 million   revolving credit facility. The New Senior Credit Facility provides for   $880 million   of senior secured term notes and an   $800 million   senior secured revolving facility, which may be used to borrow, on a same-day notice under a swing line, the lesser of   $25 million   and the aggregate unused amount of the revolving credit facility then in effect. Refer to   Note 6, Long-Term Obligations   to the Unaudited Condensed, Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Acquisitions 
  Our annual growth strategy includes the acquisition of independent animal hospitals. We also evaluate the acquisition of animal hospital chains, laboratories and related businesses if favorable opportunities are presented. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired $145.5 million and $178.3 million of annualized Animal Hospital revenue for independent animal hospitals and CAPNA, respectively. 
  The following table summarizes the changes in the number of facilities operated by our Animal Hospital and Laboratory segments during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our condensed, consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our condensed, consolidated financial statements. A discussion of such critical accounting policies, which include revenue recognition, goodwill, other intangible assets, and income taxes, can be found in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the policies noted above as of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016  .

Consolidated Results of Operations 
  The following table sets forth components of our condensed, consolidated income statements expressed as a percentage of revenue: 

Revenue 
  The following table summarizes our revenue (in thousands, except percentages): 

Consolidated revenue increased $  105.1 million   and $  273.8 million   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases in revenue were primarily attributable to revenue from animal hospitals acquired since the beginning of the comparable periods in the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue increased $17.3 million and $66.5 million for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to organic growth in our Animal Hospital and Laboratory segments. The increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the sale of Vetstreet at the end of the prior fiscal year. Our Animal Hospital same-store revenue increased   5.4%   and   6.5%   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior

year. Our Laboratory internal revenue growth was   5.5%   and   6.6%   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
  Direct Costs 
  The following table summarizes our direct costs (in thousands, except percentages): 

Consolidated direct costs increased   $86.2 million   and $  208.9 million   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases were primarily attributable to animal hospitals acquired since the beginning of the comparable periods in the prior year. Excluding the impact of animal hospital acquisitions and the sale of Vetstreet, the increases in direct costs were primarily due to compensation related costs, supplies, and rent, predominately in the animal hospital segment and discussed further under   Segment Results  .  
  Gross Profit 
  The following table summarizes our consolidated gross profit and consolidated Non-GAAP gross profit in dollars and as a percentage of applicable revenue (in thousands, except percentages): 

____________________________ 
               (1)   
    Non-GAAP consolidated gross profit and Non-GAAP gross margin are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  See   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   below for information about these Non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures, material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures, and a reconciliation of each Non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 

35 

Consolidated gross profit increased $  18.9 million   and $  64.9 million   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Non-GAAP consolidated gross profit, which excludes the impact of intangible asset amortization associated with acquisitions, increased   $22.5 million   and $  72.7 million   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.  The increase in Non-GAAP consolidated gross profit was primarily attributable to acquisitions and organic revenue growth in our Animal Hospital and Laboratory business segments. The increase in Non-GAAP consolidated gross profit included $16.9 million and $39.9 million of gross profit related to acquisitions consummated since the beginning of the comparable periods in the prior year for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Segment Results 
  Animal Hospital Segment  
  Revenue 
  Animal Hospital revenue increased   $111.5 million   and $  282.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.  The components of the increase are summarized in the following table (in thousands, except percentages and average revenue per order):    

____________________________ 
            (1)   
    Same-store revenue and orders were calculated using Animal Hospital operating results, adjusted to exclude the operating results for newly acquired animal hospitals that we did not own, as of the beginning of the comparable period in the prior year.  Same-store revenue also includes revenue generated by customers referred from our relocated or combined animal hospitals, including those merged upon acquisition. 
               (2)   
    Computed by dividing same-store revenue by same-store orders. The average revenue per order may not calculate exactly due to rounding. 
                (4)   
    Net acquired revenue represents the revenue from animal hospitals acquired, net of revenue from animal hospitals sold or closed, on or after the beginning of the comparable period in the prior year. Fluctuations in net acquired revenue occur due to the volume, size, and timing of acquisitions and dispositions. 
     During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in the prior year, our volume of same-store orders increased primarily due to the combination of positive trends in the companion animal health care industry and the impact of certain previously implemented marketing initiatives in our animal hospitals.  
    
  Our business strategy is to place a greater emphasis on comprehensive wellness visits and advanced medical procedures, which typically generate higher-priced orders.  During the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we experienced an increase in the number of higher-priced orders partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of lower-priced orders. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we experienced an increase in the number of higher-priced orders and in the number of lower-priced orders.  

36 

Price increases, as well as the mix in year over year growth rates of low to high-priced orders contributed to the overall increase in the average revenue per order.  Prices at each of our animal hospitals are reviewed regularly and adjustments are made based on market considerations, demographics and our costs.  These adjustments historically approximated an increase of 3% to 6% on most services at the majority of our animal hospitals and are typically implemented in November of each year; however, price increases in November 2015 generally ranged between 4% and 6%.  
    
  Direct Costs 
    
  Animal Hospital direct costs increased $92.3 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses of $54.4 million, medical supplies of $14.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $5.5 million and rent of $4.4 million.  The remainder of the increase was attributed to other categories, all of which were individually immaterial. The increase in compensation related-costs and medical supplies generally are related to revenue growth and acquisitions. The increase in depreciation and amortization is related to acquired animal hospitals. 
    
  Animal Hospital direct costs increased $223.6 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in the prior year.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses of $133.2 million, medical supplies of $37.1 million, depreciation and amortization of $11.9 million and rent of $10.4 million.  The remainder of the increase was attributed to other categories, all of which were individually immaterial. The increase in compensation related-costs and medical supplies generally are related to revenue growth and acquisitions. The increase in depreciation and amortization is related to acquired animal hospitals. 
    
  Gross Profit 
    
  Animal Hospital gross profit is calculated as Animal Hospital revenue less Animal Hospital direct costs.  Animal Hospital direct costs comprise all costs of services and products at the animal hospitals including, but not limited to, salaries of veterinarians, technicians and all other animal hospital-based personnel, facilities rent, occupancy costs, supply costs, depreciation and amortization, certain marketing and promotional expense and costs of goods sold associated with the retail sales of pet food and pet supplies.  
    
  The following table summarizes gross profit, gross margin, Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP gross margin for our Animal Hospital segment (in thousands, except percentages) and the same measures on a same-store basis:

limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures, and a reconciliation of each Non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
  Consolidated Animal Hospital gross profit increased $  19.2 million   and $  58.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Non-GAAP gross profit, which excludes the impact of intangible asset amortization associated with acquisitions, increased $23.0 million and $66.4 million for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in Non-GAAP consolidated gross profit was primarily attributable to additional gross profit from acquired animal hospitals of $17.0 million and $37.7 million for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and same-store revenue growth. 
    
  Over the last several years, we have acquired a significant number of animal hospitals. Many of these newly acquired animal hospitals had lower gross margins at the time of acquisition than those previously operated by us. We have improved 
  these lower gross margins, in the aggregate, subsequent to the acquisition primarily through cost efficiencies. 
    
  Laboratory Segment 
  The following table summarizes revenue and gross profit for our Laboratory segment (in thousands, except percentages): 

Laboratory revenue increased   $4.8 million   and $  23.4 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The components of the increase in Laboratory revenue are detailed below (in thousands, except percentages and average revenue per requisition): 

____________________________ 
    
            (1)   
    Internal revenue and requisitions were calculated using Laboratory operating results, which are adjusted (i) to exclude the operating results of acquired laboratories we recognized during the current year period that we did not own them in the prior year, and (ii) for the impact resulting from any differences in the number of billing days in the comparable period, if applicable. 
       
            (2)   
    Computed by dividing internal revenue by the number of requisitions. 

(4)   
    Acquired revenue represents the revenue we recognized from our acquired laboratories during the current year period that we did not own them in the prior year. 

38 

The increase in Laboratory revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in the prior year, was due to an increase in the number of requisitions and an increase in the average revenue per requisition.  The change in the average revenue per requisition was impacted by price increases in February 2016 and changes in product mix. 
  Laboratory gross profit is calculated as Laboratory revenue less direct costs. Laboratory direct cost comprises all costs of laboratory services including, but not limited to, salaries of veterinarians, specialists, technicians and other laboratory-based personnel, transportation and delivery costs, facilities rent, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization and supply costs. 
  Our Laboratory gross margin increased to   51.6%   and   52.9%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to   51.2%   and   51.9%   for the same periods in the prior year. The improvement in gross margins is primarily attributable to leverage on our fixed costs, including transportation costs. 
    
  Intercompany Revenue 
  Laboratory revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included intercompany revenue of   $20.2 million   and $  56.5 million  , respectively, generated by providing laboratory services to our animal hospitals, as compared to   $16.2 million   and $  47.9 million   for the respective prior year periods. All Other revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included intercompany revenue of   $5.5 million   and $  15.2 million  , respectively, generated by providing products and services to our animal hospitals and laboratories, as compared to   $6.3 million   and $  19.8 million   for the respective prior year periods. For purposes of reviewing the operating performance of our segments, all intercompany transactions are accounted for as if the transaction was with an independent third party at current market prices. For financial reporting purposes, intercompany transactions are eliminated as part of our consolidation. 

Selling, General and Administrative (SG A) Expense 
  SG A is primarily comprised of costs incurred to support each of our business units. These costs typically include compensation related items for our executive, accounting, legal, information technology, marketing, training, and medical operations departments and in addition, other shared costs such as marketing and rent for corporate facilities. 
  The following table summarizes our SG A expense in both dollars and as a percentage of applicable revenue (in thousands, except percentages): 

____________________________ 
            (1)   
    Animal Hospital SG A as a percentage of revenue excluding CAPNA totaled 2.4% and 2.5%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. CAPNA SG A included intangible asset amortization of $1.3 million and $1.9 million for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.

    Non-GAAP SG A is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  See   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   below for information about this Non-GAAP financial measure, including our reasons for including the measure and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measure, and a reconciliation of each Non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
       
  Consolidated SG A expense increased   $4.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of CAPNA during the period. Excluding SG A related to CAPNA, consolidated SG A increased $1.3 million for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in consolidated SG A expense for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to increases in compensation related expenses at Corporate and our Animal Hospital segment of $0.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, related to increased headcount to support our growing operations and to a lesser extent, executive compensation. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease in our All Other SG A expense as a result of the sale of our Vetstreet business at the end of our prior fiscal year.  
  Consolidated SG A expense increased $  13.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding SG A related to CAPNA, consolidated SG A increased $8.3 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The increase in consolidated SG A expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to increases in compensation related expenses at Corporate, and in our Animal Hospital and Laboratory segments of $5.8 million, $3.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively, related to increased headcount to support our growing operations and to a lesser extent, executive compensation. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease in our All Other SG A expense as a result of the sale of our Vetstreet business at the end of our prior fiscal year. 
  Operating Income 
  The following table summarizes our consolidated operating income and Non-GAAP consolidated operating income in both dollars and as a percentage of applicable revenue (in thousands, except percentages): 

____________________________ 
               (1)   
    Non-GAAP consolidated operating income and Non-GAAP consolidated operating margin are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  See   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   below for information about these Non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures, material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures, and a reconciliation of each Non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 

40 

Consolidated operating income increased by   $9.9 million   and $  45.7 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Non-GAAP consolidated operating income which excludes the impact of adjustments in the table above, increased by   $19.5 million   and $  63.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increases in Non-GAAP consolidated operating income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were primarily related to improved results, as mentioned above in our Animal Hospital and Laboratory segments, partially offset by the decrease in our All Other operating income as a result of the sale of our Vetstreet business at the end of the prior fiscal year. 
  Intangible asset amortization associated with acquisitions 
  Included in our direct costs and SG A is amortization expense related to our acquired intangible assets. At acquisition we assign a fair market value to identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill in our purchase price allocation. These assets include non-contractual customer relationships, covenants not-to-compete, trademarks, contracts and technology. For those identified intangible assets that have finite lives, we amortize those values over the estimated useful lives. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets were   $10.7 million   and $  26.7 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets were   $5.8 million  , and $  17.2 million  , respectively. 

Interest Expense, Net 
  The following table summarizes our interest expense, net of interest income (in thousands): 

____________________________  
            (1)     
    Non-GAAP interest expense is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  See   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   below for information about this financial measure including our reasons for including the measure and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of this measure. 
     The   increase   in consolidated net interest expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in the prior year, was primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average debt balance of our senior credit facility and a higher effective LIBOR rate applied against our total credit facility. The increase in our weighted average debt balance was primarily related to additional drawings from our revolving credit facility, of which $345 million was drawn in connection with the acquisition of CAPNA during the three months ended June 30, 2016 . Drawings on the revolving credit facility during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled $465 million. Additionally, an interest expense adjustment related to other long-term liabilities further contributed to increase in consolidated net interest expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate of net income attributable to VCA for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   38.9%   and   39.4%  , as compared to   39.1%   for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

41 

Inflation 
  Historically, our operations have not been materially affected by inflation. We cannot assure that our operations will not be affected by inflation in the future. 
    
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  We use Non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows our management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and in relationship to the operating results of our segments. We also believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows our management to better project our future consolidated financial performance because our forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance, and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. 
  The Non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report include Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP gross margin, computed on a consolidated basis, for our Animal Hospital segment, and the same measures expressed on a same-store basis. Additionally, our Non-GAAP financial measures include our Non-GAAP SG A, our Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating margin on a consolidated basis. Lastly, our Non-GAAP financial measures also include our Non-GAAP consolidated net income and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These Non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by us, represent the comparable GAAP measures adjusted to exclude certain charges or credits, as detailed in the tables above and below. In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the exclusion of these items and other similar items in our Non-GAAP presentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. 
  There are limitations to the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. Our Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate the Non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. In addition, these items can have a material impact on earnings. Our management compensates for the foregoing limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.  The Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for consolidated gross profit or gross margin prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We have presented reconciliations of each Non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the Non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods included in this report.  Refer to the tables above in the gross profit, SG A and operating income sections within Part I, Item 2 of this report for a reconciliation of consolidated gross profit to Non-GAAP gross profit, consolidated SG A to Non-GAAP SG A and consolidated operating income to Non-GAAP operating income. 
  Our Non-GAAP adjustments include the following: 
             
    Adjustments to other long-term liabilities   - We recorded a non-cash charge of $3.4 million, of which $2.0 million related to compensation and $1.4 million related to interest accretion. 
                
    Discrete tax items   - We recorded a non-cash tax adjustment to our income tax liabilities for $1.0 million. 
                
    Intangible asset amortization associated with acquisitions   - Our GAAP net income includes amortization expense related to intangible assets in our acquired businesses.  The amortization expense related to our acquired intangible assets can vary significantly dependent upon the amount and size of our acquisitions in each period; accordingly, we exclude amortization from our GAAP net income, for all periods presented, to provide investors with more comparable operating results.  
                
    Transaction costs related to the CAPNA acquisition   -     For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we have recorded transaction costs of $146,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, related to our acquisition of CAPNA. 
                
    Debt retirement costs adjustment   - We incurred debt retirement costs of $1.6 million in connection with our new credit facility. 

42 

Business interruption insurance gain   - Our GAAP net income includes a $4.5 million gain related to business interruption proceeds from the May 14, 2014 fire damage to the Medical Technology headquarters in Carlsbad, California for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. There were no additional estimated losses recorded in connection with the fire.  
       
  The following table reconciles our GAAP net income to Non-GAAP net income and calculates our Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the adjustments mentioned above:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Introduction 
  We generate cash primarily from (i) payments made by customers for our veterinary services, (ii) payments from animal hospitals and other clients for our laboratory services, and (iii) proceeds received from the sale of our imaging equipment and other related services. In addition, prior to its sale in 2015, we generated cash from payments received from participating hospitals for Vetstreet subscriptions and reminder notices. Our business historically has experienced strong liquidity, as fees for services provided in our animal hospitals are due at the time of service and fees for laboratory services are collected under standard industry terms. Our cash disbursements are primarily for payments related to the compensation of our employees, supplies and inventory purchases for our operating segments, occupancy and other administrative costs, interest expense, payments on long-term borrowings, capital expenditures, acquisitions and shares repurchases. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of the settlement of these transactions. 
  We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled   $72.9 million  , representing an   decrease   of   $26.0 million  , compared to   December 31, 2015  . Cash flows generated from operating activities totaled    $290.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , representing an increase of   $43.9 million  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , $  23.5 million   of the   $72.9 million   of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. Our intention is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries.  If these earnings were used to fund domestic operations, they would be subject to additional income taxes upon repatriation. 
  We have historically funded our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, investments in the acquisition of individual hospitals and laboratories, and other smaller acquisitions primarily from internally generated cash flows. As of   September 30, 2016   we had   $460 million   available under our revolving credit facility, which allows us to maintain further operating and financial flexibility. In the future, we plan to utilize our revolving credit facility to supplement our internally generated cash flows to fund both our acquisition pipeline and our share repurchase program. See Note 6,   Long-Term Obligations  , in our condensed, consolidated financial statements of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a more detailed discussion.  
    
  Historically, we have been able to access the capital markets to fund larger acquisitions that could not be funded out of internally generated cash flows. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, and market conditions. Although in the past we have been able to obtain financing for material transactions on terms we believed to be reasonable, there is a possibility that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms in the future. 
  Future Cash Flows 
  Short-Term 
  We anticipate that our cash on hand, net cash provided by operations and available funds under our revolving credit agreement and incremental facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months. If we consummate additional significant acquisitions during this period, we may seek additional debt or equity financing. 
  In August 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the continuance of our April 2013 share repurchase program, which was completed in August 2014. This plan authorizes us to repurchase up to an additional   $400 million   of our common shares from time to time in open market purchases, pursuant to trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules, through privately negotiated transactions, block trades and accelerated share repurchases.  The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, capital availability, legal requirements and economic and market conditions. As of September 30, 2016, we had repurchased $298.9 million of our common shares pursuant to our current share repurchase program. Accordingly, $101.1 million remains available for future repurchases. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the repurchase program, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The repurchases have been and will continue to be funded by existing cash balances and by our revolving credit facility.  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not repurchase any shares under the existing repurchase authorization. 
    
  For the year ended 2016, we expect to spend approximately $  105.0 million   for both property and equipment additions and capital costs necessary to maintain our existing facilities, of which, $90.5 million has been incurred through September 30, 2016. 

44 

Long-Term 
  Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to the day-to-day operations of our business, including commitments for operating leases, generally are comprised of scheduled principal and interest payments for our outstanding long-term indebtedness, capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business and acquisitions in accordance with our growth strategy. 
  We are unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due. If this cash flow is insufficient, we expect that we will need to refinance such indebtedness, amend its terms to extend maturity dates, or issue common stock of our company. Our management cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments, if necessary, will be available on attractive terms, if at all. 
  Debt Related Covenants 
  Our New Senior Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants pertaining to interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with these covenants, including the two covenant ratios, the interest coverage ratio and the leverage ratio. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had an interest coverage ratio of   16.88   to 1.00, which was in compliance with the required ratio of no less than 3.00 to 1.00. The New Senior Credit Facility defines the interest coverage ratio as that ratio that is calculated on a last 12-month basis by dividing pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined by our New Senior Credit Facility ( pro forma earnings ), by consolidated interest expense. Interest expense is defined as total interest expense with respect to all outstanding indebtedness, including commissions, discounts and other fees charged related to letters of credit. Pro forma earnings include 12 months of operating results for businesses acquired during the period. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a leverage ratio of   2.58   to 1.00, which was in compliance with the required ratio of no more than 4.00 to 1.00 from   September 30, 2016   until December 31, 2016 as defined under the New Senior Credit facility. The New Senior Credit Facility defines the leverage ratio as that ratio which is calculated as total debt divided by pro forma earnings. 

Historical Cash Flows 
  The following table summarizes our cash flows (in thousands): 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities   increased   by $  43.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior-year period. Operating cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $174.9 million   of net income, net non-cash expenses of   $96.1 million   and net cash provided as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $  19.8 million  . The changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $27.8 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, an $11.1 million increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, and an $8.4 million increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by an $11.7 million increase in inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets, an $8.0 million increase in trade accounts receivable, and a $7.8 million decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities.  
  The decreases in prepaid income taxes and accrued interest, and the increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable are primarily due to the timing of payment obligations. The increase in trade accounts receivable was primarily due to increased revenues in both our Hospital and Laboratory business segments and is partially being offset by a decrease  

45 

in our Medical Technology business segment due to improved collection efforts. The increase in inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets is primarily due to the acquisition of CAPNA. The decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities is also primarily due to the timing of payment obligations.  
  Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $22.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the prior-year period. Operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $151.9 million of net income, net non-cash expenses of $72.1 million and net cash provided as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $23.0 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $28.1 million decrease in income taxes which consisted of a $26.2 million decrease in prepaid income taxes and a $1.8 million increase in income taxes payable, and an $18.9 million increase in accrued payroll and related liabilities. This was partially offset by a $20.6 million increase in trade accounts receivable, a $2.5 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and a $1.0 million increase in inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets. The decreases in prepaid income taxes and income taxes payable and the increase in accrued payroll and related liabilities was primarily due to timing of payment obligations. The increase in trade accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in our Laboratory business segment revenue as compared to the prior-year period, as well as increased revenue related to our Hospital business segment. The decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities was also a result of timing of payment obligations. The increase in inventory, prepaid expenses, and other assets was primarily due to increases in service agreements entered into by our Laboratory business segment, and increased medical supplies in relation to the acquired hospitals in 2015, along with new product offerings. These increases were partially offset by the receipt of the insurance payment related to the May 2014 fire at our Medical Technology business and the depletion of certain products.  
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  The table below presents the components of the changes in investing cash flows (in thousands): 

____________________________ 
    
            (1)   
    The number of acquisitions will vary from period to period based upon the available pool of suitable candidates, however, the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of CAPNA during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  A discussion of our acquisitions is provided above in our   Executive Overview  . 
       
            (2)   
    The cash used to acquire property and equipment will vary from period to period based on upgrade requirements and expansion of our animal hospitals and laboratory facilities. 
       
            (3)   
    The proceeds from the sale or disposal of assets in 2015 primarily relates to the sale of a hospital. 
       
            (4)   
    We paid $7.2 million in connection with our acquisition holdbacks. Payouts will vary from period to period based on the timing of each acquisition and the acquisition holdback period. 

46 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  The table below presents the components of the changes in financing cash flows (in thousands): 

____________________________ 
            (1)   
    On June 29, 2016, we entered into a New Senior Credit Facility which resulted in the payoff of our previous senior credit facility in the amount of $577.5 million and $667.0 million for our term notes and revolving credit facility, respectively, proceeds of $880.0 million and $375.0 million from the issuance of new senior secured term notes and borrowings under our senior secured revolving facility, respectively, and payments of $3.8 million related to financing costs to creditors and third parties. A discussion of our New Senior Credit Facility is provided above in   Note 6, Long-Term Obligations  . Additionally, the repayments of long-term obligations also include $15.9 million in scheduled senior-term note principal and capital lease payments. Our principal payment obligations on our New Senior Credit Facility commenced in September 2016. 
               (2)   
    We borrowed $435.0 million from our previous revolving credit facility and $30.0 million from our new revolving credit facility in which the proceeds were primarily used to fund our acquisitions. 
     The $97.0 million borrowed from our previous revolving credit facility in 2015 was primarily used to fund stock repurchases under our existing $400.0 million share repurchase authorization and fund our acquisitions. 
            (3)   
    In August 2016 we made a payment of $65.0 million to reduce the balance of our new revolving credit facility in an effort to minimize our interest expense and to manage our overall cash balance. 
               (4)   
    The cash paid to purchase noncontrolling interests will vary based upon differing opportunities and circumstances during each of the respective periods. 
               (5)   
    The proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock incentive plans increased in 2016 as there were more exercises due to options nearing their expiration. 
               (6)   
    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the cash paid for stock repurchases related to income taxes paid on behalf of employees who elected to net settle their tax obligation from option exercises and vested stock.  
     For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the cash paid for stock repurchases included both the repurchase of our common shares in accordance with our share repurchase program and income taxes paid on behalf of employees who elected to net settle their tax obligation from option exercises and vested stock. 
            (7)   
    In September 2015, we received $2.7 million in proceeds from the formation of a noncontrolling interest.

Future Contractual Cash Requirements 
    
  The following table sets forth material changes from the amounts reported in our   2015   Form 10-K to our scheduled principal and  interest due by us for each of the years indicated as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1)   
    The interest payments on our variable-rate senior term notes are based on rates effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  
     Off-Balance-Sheet Financing Arrangements 
  Other than operating leases, as of   September 30, 2016  , we do not have any off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. 
  Description of Indebtedness 
  New Senior Credit Facility 
  We entered into a new senior credit facility on June 29, 2016 and pay interest on our senior term notes and revolving credit facility based on the interest rate offered to our administrative agent on, the Eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin determined by reference to the leverage ratio in effect from time-to-time, ranging from 1.00% to 2.00% per annum, as set forth in the table in Note 6,   Long-Term Obligations  , of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.     We pay a commitment fee on our revolving credit facility determined by reference to the Leverage Ratio in effect from time-to-time ranging from 0.25% to 0.40% per annum, as set forth in Note 6,   Long-Term Obligations,   of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $875 million   in principal outstanding under our senior term notes and   $340 million   borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 
  The senior term notes and the revolving credit facility mature in June 2021. 
  Other Debt and Capital Lease Obligations 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a seller note secured by assets of a certain animal hospital, capital leases, and other debt that consisted of   $5.0 million   and   $66.2 million   included in the current portion and non-current portion of long-term debt, respectively. Our seller note matures in   2016   and has an interest rate of   10.0%  . Our capital leases and other debt have various maturities through 2042 and various interest rates ranging from   1.9%   to   15.0%  .

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     There have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk from those disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     We carried out an evaluation required by the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  During our most recent fiscal quarter, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur, or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.

PART II. 
    OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
       
  On May 29, 2013, a former veterinary assistant at one of our animal hospitals filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, titled Jorge Duran vs. VCA Animal Hospitals, Inc., et. al.  The lawsuit seeks to assert claims on behalf of current and former veterinary assistants employed by us in California, and alleges, among other allegations, that we improperly failed to pay regular and overtime wages, improperly failed to provide proper meal and rest periods, and engaged in unfair business practices.  The lawsuit seeks damages, statutory penalties, and other relief, including attorneys  fees and costs.  On May 7, 2014, we obtained partial summary judgment, dismissing four of eight claims of the complaint, including the claims for failure to pay regular and overtime wages.  On January 9, 2014, Plaintiff Duran moved to certify a meal period premium class, a rest period premium class and a class under California s Business and Professions Code   17200   et seq.,   On June 24, 2015, the Court denied Plaintiff s Motion.  Plaintiff is now pursuing his representative claims under the seventh cause of action (Private Attorneys General Act or PAGA). We intend to continue to vigorously defend against the remaining claim in this action.  At this time, we are unable to estimate the reasonable possible loss or range of possible loss, but do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position taken as a whole. 
  On July 16, 2014, two additional former veterinary assistants filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, titled La Kimba Bradsbery and Cheri Brakensiek vs. Vicar Operating, Inc., et. al. The lawsuit seeks to assert claims on behalf of current and former veterinary assistants, kennel assistants, and client service representatives employed by us in California, and alleges, among other allegations, that we improperly failed to pay regular and overtime wages, improperly failed to provide proper meal and rest periods, improperly failed to pay reporting time pay, improperly failed to reimburse for certain business-related expenses, and engaged in unfair business practices. The lawsuit seeks damages, statutory penalties, and other relief, including attorneys  fees and costs.  In September 2014, the court issued an order staying the La Kimba Bradsbery lawsuit, which stay remains in place. On or about August 23, 2016, the Court lifted the stay and discovery is proceeding. We intend to vigorously defend against the Bradsbery action. At this time, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of possible loss, but do not believe losses, if any, would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position taken as a whole. 
  On July 12, 2013, an individual who provided courier services with respect to our laboratory clients in California filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Santa Clara - San Jose Branch, titled Carlos Lopez vs. Logistics Delivery Solutions, LLC, Antech Diagnostics, Inc., et. al.  Logistics Delivery Solutions, LLC, a co-defendant in the lawsuit, is a company with which Antech has contracted to provide courier services in California. The lawsuit sought to assert claims on behalf of individuals who were engaged by Logistics Delivery Solutions, LLC to perform such courier services and alleges, among other allegations, that Logistics Delivery Solutions and Antech Diagnostics improperly classified the plaintiffs as independent contractors, improperly failed to pay overtime wages, and improperly failed to provide proper meal periods. The lawsuit sought damages, statutory penalties, and other relief, including attorneys' fees and costs. The parties agreed to settle the action, on a class-wide basis, for an amount not to exceed $1,250,000. Logistics Delivery Solutions, LLC, has agreed to pay half of the claim. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2016, we have accrued the remaining fifty percent. The settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or acceptance of fault by any of the defendants named in the complaint.  Antech Diagnostics and Logistics Delivery Solutions agreed to the settlement to eliminate the uncertainties, risk, distraction and expense associated with protracted litigation.  The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on November 30, 2015 and issued an order granting final approval of the settlement on March 25, 2016.  On April 11, 2016, the Court entered the Judgment approving the settlement and the judgment went into effect on June 1, 2016.  The final settlement amount was approximately $900,000, half of which was paid by DSA pursuant to our agreement.  Payments to class members were made in early July 2016 and this matter is now closed. 
  On May 12, 2014, an individual client who purchased goods and services from one of our animal hospitals filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, titled Tony M. Graham vs. VCA Antech, Inc. and VCA Animal Hospitals, Inc. The lawsuit sought to assert claims on behalf of the plaintiff and other individuals who purchased similar goods and services from our animal hospitals and alleged, among other allegations, that we improperly charged such individuals for  biohazard waste management  in connection with the services performed.  The lawsuit sought compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts, and other relief, including attorneys' fees and costs. VCA successfully had the venue transferred to the Southern District of California. Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification on February 12, 2016. In late July 2016, VCA had filed a Summary Judgment Motion. The Honorable Christina Snyder issued her decision on September 12, 2016, denying Plaintiffs  motion for class certification and granting Defendants   

50 

summary judgment motion. Plaintiff in this action filed an appeal of this judgment in October 2016. We intend to continue to vigorously defend this action.  
  In addition to the lawsuits described above, we are party to ordinary routine legal proceedings and claims incidental to our business, but we are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
