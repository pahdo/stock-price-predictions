Exhibit 99.1 

FSFR Glick JV LLC     
  (a limited liability company) 
    
  Consolidated Financial Statements 
    
  For the Fiscal Year Ended   September 30, 2016   and the Period from April 21, 2015 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2015 

FSFR Glick JV LLC 
  Table of Contents 

Independent Auditor s Report  

To the Board of Directors of FSFR Glick JV LLC:  
    
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of FSFR Glick JV LLC and its subsidiary (the Fund), which comprise the consolidated statement of assets, liabilities and members  capital, including the consolidated schedule of investments, as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and the related consolidated statement of operations, of changes in members  capital and of cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2016 and the period from April 21, 2015 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2015.  
    
  Management s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements  
    
  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
    
  Auditor s Responsibility  
    
  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.  
    
  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Fund s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  
    
  Opinion  
    
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FSFR Glick JV LLC and its subsidiary at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, and the results of their operations, changes in their members' capital and their cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2016 and the period from April 21, 2015 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2015, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS PURPOSE 
    
  FSFR Glick JV LLC ( FSFR Glick JV  or the "Fund ), a Delaware limited liability company ("LLC") together with its consolidated subsidiary, commenced operations on April 21, 2015 to primarily invest in senior secured loans of middle-market companies. The Fund is governed by a limited liability company agreement dated October 20, 2014 (the "LLC Agreement").  FSFR Glick JV Funding LLC ( Funding ), a consolidated, wholly-owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of the Fund, was formed in connection with the closing of a senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Suisse facility") with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Island Branch.  Funding was organized as a LLC under the laws of the State of Delaware, and commenced operations on April 21, 2015.  
    
  The Fund has two members (collectively, the "Members"), Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp.  ( FSFR ) and GF Equity Funding 2014 LLC ("GF Equity Funding").  FSFR is a publicly traded business development company managed by Fifth Street Management LLC, its external investment adviser.  The Fund is managed by a four person board of directors, two of whom are selected by FSFR and two of whom are selected by GF Equity Funding. FSFR Glick JV is capitalized as transactions are completed by the Members in exchange for LLC equity interests, and FSFR and GF Debt Funding 2014 LLC ("GF Debt Funding"), an entity advised by affiliates of GF Equity Funding, in exchange for subordinated notes. All portfolio decisions and investment decisions in respect of the Fund must be approved by the FSFR Glick JV investment committee, which consists of one representative from FSFR and one representative of GF Equity Funding (with approval from a representative of each required).  

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The Fund s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). All investment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis.  The Fund is considered an Investment Company under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") 946 -   Financial Services - Investment Companies. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to the Fund and on various other assumptions that the Fund believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The most significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the Fund s Consolidated Financial Statements are the valuation of investments and revenue recognition. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The Fund values its investments in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"), which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments' complexity. 
  Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows: 

Level 1   Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
     
   13 

    FSFR Glick JV LLC  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Level 3   Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. 
     In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, an investment's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The Fund's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment.  Generally, it is expected that all of the Fund's investment securities will be valued using Level 3 inputs.  This includes investment securities that are valued using "bid" and "ask" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments are generally classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions. 
  Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value. As such, the Fund obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by independent pricing services for all of the Fund's senior secured debt investments for which quotations are available. In determining the fair value of a particular investment, pricing services use observable market information, including both binding and non-binding indicative quotations.  
  The Fund evaluates the prices obtained from independent pricing services based on available market information and company specific data that could affect the credit quality and/or fair value of the investment. Investments for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, the Fund looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. The Fund does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe any such market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment.  Examples of events that would cause market quotations to not reflect fair value could include cases when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a "fire sale" by a distressed seller. In these instances, the Fund values such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available (as discussed below). 
  If the quotation provided by the pricing service is based on only one or two market sources, the Fund performs additional procedures to corroborate such information, generally including, but not limited to, the bond yield approach discussed below and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit quality and market trends affecting the portfolio company. 
  The Fund performs detailed valuations of its debt and equity investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are deemed not to represent fair value of the investments. The Fund typically uses two different valuation techniques. The first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value ("EV") of the portfolio company. EV means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time. The primary method for determining EV uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company's EBITDA (generally defined as earnings before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization). EBITDA multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies, if any. The Fund may also employ other valuation multiples to determine EV, such as revenues. The second method for determining EV uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates (typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions). The EV analysis is typically performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an EV analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other alternative methods such as an asset liquidation model, expected recovery model or a recent observable or pending transaction may be utilized to estimate EV. The second valuation technique is a bond yield approach, which is typically performed for non-credit impaired debt investments. To determine fair value using a bond yield approach, a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk. In the bond yield approach, the Fund considers the current contractual interest rate, the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the Fund and the specific investment. A key determinant of risk, among other things, is the leverage through the investment relative to the EV of the portfolio company. As debt investments held by the Fund are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market, the Fund depends on primary market data, including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements, as well as  
  
   14 

    FSFR Glick JV LLC  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield, as applicable. 
  In addition, the Fund has utilized independent valuation firms to provide valuation assistance for certain of the Fund's portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment.  
    
  Investment Transactions 
    
  Purchases and sales of investments, and the related realized gains and losses, are recorded on a trade-date basis, with the gains and losses reflected in the Fund's Consolidated Statements of Operations.   
    
  The cost of an investment includes all costs incurred by the Fund as part of the purchase of such investment.  The difference between recognized cost and the subsequent fair value measurement of an investment is reflected as "net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   
    
  Investment Income 
    
  Interest income, adjusted for accretion of original issue discount ("OID"), is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected.  The Fund stops accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible. 
    
  PIK interest on certain of the Fund's debt investments, which represents contractually deferred interest capitalized into the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. The Fund generally ceases accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if the Fund does not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. The Fund's decision to cease accruing PIK interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company, including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities; monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company; the Fund's assessment of the portfolio company's business development success, including product development, profitability and the portfolio company's overall adherence to its business plan; information obtained by the Fund in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company's management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates. Based on this and other information, the Fund determines whether to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security. The Fund's determination to cease accruing PIK interest on a loan or debt security is generally made well before the Fund's full write-down of such loan or debt security. 
    
  Fee income consists of the amendment fees and prepayment fees that the Fund receives in connection with its debt investments. These fees are recognized as earned.  
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash consist of demand deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when acquired. The Fund places its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash with financial institutions and, at times, cash held in bank accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insured limit. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 assets and are included on the Fund's Consolidated Schedule of Investments. 
    
  Restricted Cash 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015, included in restricted cash was $  3.3 million   and $2.2 million, respectively, that was held at Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ("Wells Fargo"), in connection with the Fund's senior credit facility. The Fund is restricted in terms of access to this cash until such time as the Fund submits its required periodic reporting schedules and verifies the Fund s compliance with the terms of the credit agreement.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Receivable from secured financing arrangement 
    
  The Fund follows the guidance in ASC 860 when accounting for loan participations and other loan purchases. Such guidance provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and requires a participation or other partial loan purchases to meet the definition of a "participating interest," as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other loan purchases which do not meet the definition of a participating interest or which are not eligible for sale accounting are accounted for as a receivable on the Consolidated Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital until the definition is met. Receivable from secured financing arrangement is carried at fair value. See Note 5 for additional information. 
    
  Receivables From Unsettled Transactions 
    
  Receivables from unsettled transactions consist of amounts receivable to the Fund for transactions that have not settled at the reporting date. 
    
  Interest Receivable 
    
  Interest receivable consists of interest due from the Fund s portfolio companies as of the balance sheet date. 
    
  Deferred Financing Costs 
    
  Deferred financing costs consist of fees and expenses paid in connection with the closing or amending of the Fund's credit facility, and are capitalized at the time of payment. Deferred financing costs are amortized using the straight line method over the terms of the credit facility. This amortization expense is included in interest expense in the Fund s Consolidated Statement of Operations. Upon early termination of a credit facility, the remaining balance of unamortized fees related to such facility is accelerated into interest expense. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of FSFR Glick JV and Funding.  FSFR Glick JV owns 100% of Funding.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation in conformity with GAAP. 
    
  Fair Value Option 
    
  The Fund adopted ASC 825-10-25-1   Financial Instruments - Fair Value Option   as of April 21, 2015, and elected the fair value option for its subordinated notes payable which have aggregate proceeds of   $73.1 million   and a fair value of $  65.0 million  , as of   September 30, 2016   and have aggregate proceeds of $60.7 million and a fair value of $60.1 million, as of September 30, 2015. The Fund believes that by electing the fair value option for these financial instruments, it provides consistent measurement of the Fund's investments which are carried at fair value. The Fund utilizes the bond yield approach as discussed above to determine the fair value of the subordinated notes payable.   
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Fund is not subject to federal income tax, but may be subject to certain state taxes. Each member is individually liable for taxes on its share of the Fund's income or loss.  FASB ASC 740 -   Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes   ( ASC 740 ) provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the Fund s Consolidated Financial Statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period.  Management s determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an ongoing analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.  For the years ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015, management has concluded that there are no material uncertain income tax positions for the 2016 and 2015 tax years, and does not expect this to change in the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2016, the 2015 tax year remains subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction under the statute of limitations. The Fund files U.S. federal income tax returns and income tax returns in the state of Connecticut.

Allocations of Profits and Losses 
    
  Allocations of profit and loss will be allocated to each member s capital account on a pro rata basis in a manner consistent with the procedures outlined in the LLC Agreement.  
    
  Indemnifications 
    
  In the normal course of its business, the Fund enters into contracts and agreements with certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications and guarantees against specified potential losses in connection with their activities as an agent of, or providing services to, the Fund. The Fund s maximum exposure under these agreements is unknown, as this may involve future claims that could be made against the Fund and have not yet occurred. The Fund expects the risk of any future obligation under these arrangements to be remote and has not recorded any contingent liability in the financial statements for these indemnifications. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03   Interest-Imputation of Interest   (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, that requires debt issuance costs (deferred financing costs) related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Additionally, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, which provides further clarification on the same topic and states that the SEC would not object to the deferral and presentation of debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequent amortization of the deferred costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  This guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements as the Fund's debt liabilities are comprised entirely of line-of-credit arrangements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01   Financial Instruments - Overall  , which makes limited amendments to the guidance in GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. The new standard significantly revises an entity s accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods therein.  Early adoption is permitted specifically for the amendments pertaining to the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.  Early adoption of all other amendments is not permitted. Upon adoption, the Fund will be required to make a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Consolidated Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.  The Fund did not early adopt the new guidance during the year ended September 30, 2016. The Fund is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  3.  RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  The Fund entered into an administrative and loan services agreement (the  administration agreement ) with FSC CT LLC ("FSC CT"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FSFR's investment adviser, under which FSC CT provides administrative services for the Fund, including office facilities and equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services at such facilities. Under the administration agreement, FSC CT also performs, or oversees the performance of, the Fund's required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records which the Fund is required to maintain and preparing financial statements in accordance with the Fund's LLC Agreement.  In addition, FSC CT assists the Fund in overseeing the preparation and filing of the Fund's tax returns and generally overseeing the payment of Fund expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Fund by others. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Fund reimburses FSC CT the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by FSC CT in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and the Fund's allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of the FSC CT's accounting and legal departments.  Such reimbursement is at cost, with no profit to, or markup by, FSC CT. The Fund's allocable portion of FSC CT s costs is determined based upon costs attributable to the Fund's operations versus costs attributable to the operations of other  
  
   17 

    FSFR Glick JV LLC  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

entities for which FSC CT provides administrative services. The administration agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 90 days  written notice to the other party. 
    
  The administration agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, FSC CT and its officers, managers, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from the Fund for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys  fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of services under the administration agreement or otherwise as administrator for the Fund. 
    
  FSC CT did not charge the Fund for any allocable portion of expenses for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.   
    
  4. PURCHASE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS FROM FSFR 
    
  During the year ended September 30, 2016, FSFR sold $48.9 million of senior secured debt investments at fair value to FSFR Glick JV in exchange for $47.6 million of cash consideration, $1.2 million of subordinated notes, and $0.1 million of LLC equity interests in the Fund.  The fair value of each asset the Fund purchased from FSFR was agreed upon by the Fund's board of directors.  
    
  During the period from April 21, 2015 through September 30, 2015, FSFR sold $179.8 million of senior secured debt investments at fair value to FSFR Glick JV in exchange for $121.0 million of cash consideration, $52.9 million of subordinated notes, and $5.9 million of LLC equity interests in the Fund.  The fair value of each asset the Fund purchased from FSFR was mutually agreed upon by the Fund's board of directors.

All of the Fund's investments are considered Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. All transfers between fair value hierarchy levels are recognized by the Fund at the end of each reporting period. For the year ended September 30, 2016 and the period from April 21, 2015 (commencement of operations) through September 30, 2015, no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels were recognized. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015, the Fund had no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Such arrangements, if entered into by the Fund, could involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital and are not reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

  The table below represents a financial asset, as of   September 30, 2016  , that was transferred from FSFR to the Fund that did not qualify for true sale accounting as prescribed by ASC 860.  It has the same economic characteristics as those investments that did meet the criteria for true sale accounting (i.e. an interest bearing loan), however, the GAAP authoritative literature requires that it not be presented as an investment in the Fund's Consolidated Financial Statements.

7.  SUBORDINATED NOTES AND EQUITY COMMITMENTS 
    
  The Members provide funding to the Fund in the form of subordinated notes and equity interests.  The subordinated notes are junior in right of payment to the repayment of temporary contributions made by FSFR to fund investments of FSFR Glick JV that are repaid when GF Equity Funding and GF Debt Funding make their capital contributions and fund their subordinated notes, respectively, and the holders of senior debt, including the Credit Suisse facility.  The Fund declared distributions throughout the year ended   September 30, 2016   and the period ended September 30, 2015 in the amount of $3.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of available cash after the payment of interest expense and operating expenses.  The Fund has elected to fair value the subordinated notes issued to both FSFR and GF Debt Funding.  The subordinated notes are valued by calculating the net present values of the future expected cash flow streams using an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate model. 
    
  The subordinated notes mature on October 20, 2021 and bear interest at rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 8.0% per annum. The interest expense related to these notes for the year ended September 30, 2016 and for the period from April 21, 2015 through September 30, 2015, was $  5.8 million   and $2.0 million, respectively.    
    
  The following table summarizes information related to the subordinated note and equity commitments to the Fund as of   September 30, 2016  :

8. CREDIT SUISSE FACILITY 
    
  On April 17, 2015, Funding, a consolidated wholly-owned bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiary, entered into a Loan Financing and Servicing Agreement (the "CS Credit Agreement") with respect to an eight-year senior secured credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Island Branch ("Credit Suisse") as administrative agent, and each of the lenders from time to time thereto, in the amount of $200.0 million. The Credit Suisse facility is secured by all of the assets of Funding, and all of the Fund s equity interest in Funding. Unless extended, the period during which Funding may make and reinvest borrowings under the facility will expire on April 17, 2018 and the maturity date of the facility is April 17, 2023. All borrowings under the Credit Suisse facility bear interest at a rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum and the unused commitment fee rate was 0.5% per annum through January 15, 2015 and is 1.0% per annum if drawn more than 75%, thereafter. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015,   $124.6 million   and $122.4 million was outstanding under the Credit Suisse facility, respectively.  The interest expense related to the Credit Suisse facility for the year ended September 30, 2016 and for the period from April 21, 2015 through September 30, 2015 was   $5.0 million   and $1.4 million, respectively, including coupon interest, unused fees and the amortization of deferred financing costs relating to the Credit Suisse facility.    
    
  The CS Credit Agreement and related agreements governing the Credit Suisse facility require both Funding and the Fund to, among other things (i) make representations and warranties regarding the collateral as well as each of its businesses, (ii) agree to certain indemnification obligations, and (iii) comply with various covenants, servicing procedures, limitations on acquiring and disposing of assets, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities, including a prepayment penalty in certain cases. The Credit Suisse facility agreements also include usual and customary default provisions such as the failure to make timely payments under the facility, a change in control of Funding, and the failure by Funding or the Fund to materially perform under the CS Credit Agreement and related

agreements governing the Credit Suisse facility, which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility, thereby materially and adversely affecting the Fund s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  9. RISKS 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Fund is exposed to market risk and credit risk on certain investments.  Until such investments are sold or matured, the Fund is exposed to credit risk relating to whether the debt issuer will meet its obligation when it becomes due.  Details of the Fund's investment portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015 are disclosed in the Fund's Consolidated Schedule of Investments.  
    
  The Fund may borrow funds in order to increase the amount of capital available for investment.  The use of leverage can  improve the return on invested capital; however, such use may also magnify the potential for loss on invested equity capital. If the value of the Fund s assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had the Fund not leveraged. Similarly, any decrease in the Fund s income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had the Fund not borrowed. Borrowings will usually be from credit facilities and will typically be secured by the Fund's securities and other assets.  Under certain circumstances, such credit facilities may demand an increase in the collateral that secures the Fund's obligations and if the Fund were unable to provide additional collateral, the credit facilities could liquidate assets held in the account to satisfy the Fund's obligations to the credit facilities.  Liquidation in this manner could have adverse consequences.  In addition, the amount of the Fund's borrowings and the interest rates on those borrowings, which will fluctuate, could have a significant effect on the Fund's profitability. 
    
  The Fund is exposed to counterparty risk in connection with the Credit Suisse facility, which is the risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the contractual provisions.  If Credit Suisse were to become insolvent, or otherwise unable to fund advances under the Credit Suisse facility, the Fund may not be able to make additional investments which could adversely affect the operating performance of the Fund.   
    
  Economic recession or downturns may result in a prolonged period of market illiquidity which could have a material adverse effect on the Fund's business, financial condition and results of operations.  Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase the Fund's costs, limit the Fund's access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to the Fund.  These events could limit the Fund's investment purchases, limit the Fund's ability to grow and negatively impact its operating results. 
    
  The Fund has only two investors.  Each investor has the ability under the LLC agreement to dissolve the Fund with 90 days written notice to the other investor.  In this event, the Fund would undertake an orderly liquidation process which could adversely affect the amount of liquidation proceeds and/or net asset value in the case of illiquid investments with limited external investor interest. 
     
  10. MEMBERS' CAPITAL 
    
  The Fund establishes a capital account on its books for each Member.  The initial balance of a Member capital account is equal to the amount contributed by such Member and is adjusted to reflect, among other things, distributions to such Member, and such Member's share of net profits and losses.  
    
  Contributions received are credited to Members' capital and withdrawals are reduced from the Members' capital account on the effective dates. 
    
  11. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
    
  The Members are responsible for all investment making and business decisions, and therefore, there is no requirement to show financial highlights per ASC 946, which have been omitted accordingly.  
    
  12. REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS 
    
  In April 2016, the Fund restructured its debt investment in Ameritox Ltd. As a part of the restructuring, the Fund 
  exchanged its debt securities for debt and equity securities in the restructured entity. A realized loss of $3.1 million was recorded on the transaction.
