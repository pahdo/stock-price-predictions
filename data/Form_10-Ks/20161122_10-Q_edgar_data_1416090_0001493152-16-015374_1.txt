1.
Nature of Business   

Inception
Mining Inc. ( the Company ) is a precious metal mineral production, acquisition, exploration and development company.
The Company was incorporated under the name  Golf Alliance Corporation  under the laws of the State of Nevada on July
2, 2007 and has focused on precious metal mineral acquisition and exploration since 2010.  

On
March 5, 2010, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to (1) to change its name to  Silver America, Inc. 
and (2) increased its authorized common stock from 100,000,000 to 500,000,000. On June 23, 2010, the Company amended its articles
of incorporation to change its name to  Gold American Mining Corp.  On November 21, 2012, the Company implemented
a 200-to-1 reverse stock split. Upon effectiveness of the stock split, each shareholder canceled 200 shares of common stock for
every share of common stock owned as of November 21, 2012. This reverse stock split was effective on February 13, 2013.  

On
February 25, 2013, Gold American Mining Corp. and its majority shareholder (the  Majority Shareholder ), and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Inception Development Inc. (the  Subsidiary ), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Asset
Purchase Agreement ) with Inception Resources, LLC, a Utah corporation ( Inception Resources ), pursuant to
which the Company purchased the U.P. and Burlington Gold Mine in consideration for 16,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company,
the assumption of promissory notes in the amount of $950,000 and the assignment of a 3% net royalty. Inception Resources was an
entity owned by and under the control of the majority shareholder. This transaction was deemed an asset purchase by entities under
common control. The Asset Purchase Agreement closed on February 25, 2013. Inception was a  shell company  (as such
term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) immediately prior to the acquisition of the
U.P and Burlington Gold Mine pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, and such classification ceased upon the closing
of the Asset Purchase Agreement.  

On
May 17, 2013, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to Inception Mining Inc. ( Inception 
or the  Company ).  

On
October 2, 2015, the Company consummated a merger (the  Merger ) with Clavo Rico Ltd. ( Clavo Rico ).
Clavo Rico is a privately held Turks and Caicos company with principal operations in Honduras, Central America. Clavo Rico operates
the Clavo Rico mining concession through its subsidiaries Compa  a Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A de C.V. and Compa  a
Minera Clavo Rico, S.A. de C.V., and holds other mining concessions. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company issued 240,225,901
shares of its common stock and assumed promissory notes in the amount of $5,488,980 and accrued interest of $3,434,426. As a result
of the Merger, there was a change in control and it has been treated for accounting purposes as a reverse recapitalization with
Clavo Rico, Ltd. being the surviving entity. Clavo Rico s operations and workings include several historical underground
operations dating back to the early Mayan and Spanish occupation, as described further below.  

The
Company s primary operating mine is located on the 200-hectare Clavo Rico Concession, located in southern Honduras. This
mine was originally explored and exploited in the 16th century by the Spanish, and more recently has been operated by Compa  a
Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A. de C.V. In 2003, Clavo Rico s predecessor purchased a 20% interest and later increased its ownership
to 99.9%.  

On
January 11, 2016 the Board of Directors of Inception Mining Inc. (the  Company ) proposed, and its shareholders approved
to effectuate a reverse split of the Company s outstanding common stock, at a ratio of up to one post-split share per five
and half pre-split shares (1:5.5) (the  Reverse Split ). The Company subsequently took steps to carry out the execution
of the Reverse Split, including notifying the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ). On May 25, 2016,
FINRA approved the Reverse Split, with a market effective date of May 26, 2016.  

Immediately
before the Reverse Split, the Company had 265,083,479 shares of common stock outstanding. Immediately after the Reverse Split,
the Company had 48,197,495 shares of common stock outstanding, pending fractional-share rounding-up calculations to adjust for
the Reverse Split.  

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Going
Concern -  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements during nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred net income of $8,656,767 and provided $593,250
in cash for operating activities, however the Company had a negative working capital of $23,530,269 and accumulated deficit
of $21,697,296. These factors among others indicate that the Company may be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable
period of time.  

The
Company s existence is dependent upon management s ability to develop profitable operations and to obtain additional
funding sources. There can be no assurance that the Company s financing efforts will result in profitable operations or
the resolution of the Company s liquidity problems. The accompanying statements do not include any adjustments that might
result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Management
is currently working to make changes that will result in profitable operations and to obtain additional funding sources to meet
the Company s need for cash during the next twelve months and beyond.  

Principles
of Consolidation -  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Inception Mining Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries, Inception Development, Corp., Clavo Rico Development Corp., Clavo Rico, Ltd. and Compa  a
Minera Cerros del R o, S.A. de C.V., and its controlling interest subsidiaries, Compa  a Minera Cerros del
Sur, S.A. de C.V. and Compa  a Minera Clavo Rico, S.A. de C.V. (collectively, the  Company ). All intercompany
accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

Basis
of Presentation -  The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. All adjustments have been made consisting of normal recurring adjustments and consolidating
entries, necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016,
the results of its consolidated statements of comprehensive income/(loss) for the three month and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, and its consolidated cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015. The results of consolidated operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the
full year.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents -  The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents.  

Inventories,
Stockpiles and Mineralized Material on Leach Pads -  Inventories, including stockpiles and mineralized material on leach pads
are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price of
the product based on current and long-term metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production and bring the product
to sale. Write-downs of stockpiles, mineralized material on leach pads and inventories to net realizable value are reported as
a component of costs applicable to mining revenue. Cost is comprised of production costs for mineralized material produced and
processed. Production costs include the costs of materials, costs of processing, direct labor, mine site and processing facility
overhead costs, stock-based compensation, and depreciation, amortization and depletion.  

Stockpiles
  -  Stockpiles represent mineralized material that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing.
Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile. Stockpile tonnages are verified
by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed using current
mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the material, including applicable overhead, depreciation, and depletion
relating to mining operations, and removed at each stockpile s average cost per ton.  

Mineralized
Material on Leach Pads   -  The Company utilizes a heap leaching process to recover gold from its mineralized material.
Under this method, the mineralized material is placed on leach pads where it is treated with a chemical solution that dissolves
the gold contained in the material. The resulting gold-bearing solution is further processed in a facility where the gold is recovered.
Costs are added to mineralized material on leach pads based on current mining and processing costs, including applicable depreciation
relating to mining and processing operations. Costs are transferred from mineralized material on leach pads to subsequent stages
of in-process inventories as the gold-bearing solution is processed. The value of such transferred costs of mineralized material
on leach pads is based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad.  

The
estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of material placed on the leach pads (measured
tons added to the leach pads), the grade of material placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage.  

Although
the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the quantities and grades of material
placed on leach pads to the quantities and grades quantities of gold actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature
of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing
process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Variations between actual and estimated
quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted
for on a prospective basis.  

In-process
Inventories   -  In-process inventories represent mineralized materials that are currently in the process of being converted
to a saleable product through the absorption, desorption, recovery (ADR) process. The value of in-process material is measured
based on assays of the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of material. In-process inventories are valued
at the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines, stockpiles
and/or leach pads plus the in-process conversion costs, including applicable depreciation relating to the process facilities incurred
to that point in the process.  

Finished
Goods Inventories   -  Finished goods inventories include gold that has been processed through the Company s ADR
facility and are valued at the average cost of their production.  

Exploration
and Development Costs -  Costs of acquiring mining properties and any exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred
unless proven and probable reserves exist and the property is a commercially mineable property in accordance with FASB ASC 930,
 Extractive Activities- Mining . Mine development costs incurred either to develop new gold and silver deposits, expand the
capacity of operating mines, or to develop mine areas substantially in advance of current production are capitalized. Costs incurred
to maintain current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations. Costs of abandoned projects
are charged to operations upon abandonment. The Company evaluates, at least quarterly, the carrying value of capitalized mining
costs and related property, plant and equipment costs, if any, to determine if these costs are in excess of their net realizable
value and if a permanent impairment needs to be recorded. The periodic evaluation of carrying value of capitalized costs and any
related property, plant and equipment costs are based upon expected future cash flows and/or estimated salvage value.  

The
Company capitalizes costs for mining properties by individual property and defers such costs for later amortization only if the
prospects for economic productions are reasonably certain.  

Capitalized
costs are expensed in the period when the determination has been made that economic production does not appear reasonably certain.  

Mineral
Rights and Properties -  We defer acquisition costs until we determine the viability of the property. Since we do not have
proven and probable reserves as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Industry Guide 7, exploration
expenditures are expensed as incurred. We expense care and maintenance costs as incurred.  

We
review the carrying value of our mineral rights and properties for impairment whenever there are negative indicators of impairment.
Our estimate of the gold price, mineralized materials, operating capital, and reclamation costs are subject to risks and uncertainties
affecting the recoverability of our investment in the mineral claims and properties. Although we have made our best, most current
estimate of these factors, it is possible that near term changes could adversely affect estimated net cash flows from our mineral
claims and properties and possibly require future asset impairment write-downs.  

Where
estimates of future net operating cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment, we assess recoverability
of carrying value from other means, including net cash flows generated by the sale of the asset. We use the units-of-production
method to deplete the mineral rights and properties.  

Fair
Value Measurements -  The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets
are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition,
the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the party s own credit risk.  

Fair
value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability
of the information used to determine fair values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level
of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories:  

Level
1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets
with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level
3: Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.  

To
the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination
of fair value requires more judgment. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of
the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair
value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  

The
carrying value of the Company s cash, accounts payable, short-term borrowings (including convertible notes payable), and
other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term maturity.  

The
Company recognizes its derivative liabilities as level 3 and values its derivatives using the methods discussed below  (See
Note 4). While the Company believes that its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants,
it recognizes that the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments
could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The primary assumptions that would significantly affect
the fair values using the methods discussed below are that of volatility and market price of the underlying common stock of the
Company.  

Long-Lived
Assets -  We review the carrying amount of our long-lived assets for impairment whenever there are negative indicators of impairment.
An asset is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. In the event
the carrying amount of such asset is not considered recoverable, the asset is adjusted to its fair value. Fair value is generally
determined based on discounted future cash flows.  

Properties,
Plant and Equipment -  We record properties, plant and equipment at historical cost. We provide depreciation and amortization
in amounts sufficient to match the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives or productive value.
We capitalize expenditures for improvements that significantly extend the useful life of an asset. We charge expenditures for
maintenance and repairs to operations when incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives as follows:  

Building  
      7
    to 15 years   
 
      Vehicles
    and equipment  
      3
    to 7 years   
 
      Processing
    and laboratory  
      5
    to 15 years   
 
      Furniture
    and fixtures  
      2
    to 3 years   

Reclamation
Liabilities and Asset Retirement Obligations -  Minimum standards for site reclamation and closure have been established for
us by various government agencies. Asset retirement obligations are recognized when incurred and recorded as liabilities at fair
value. The liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to earnings. In addition, the asset retirement cost is capitalized
and amortized over the life of the related asset. Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated
present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation
and abandonment costs. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, the asset retirement obligation
at each mine site.  

Revenue
Recognition -  Revenue is recognized from sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is determinable,
the product has been delivered, the title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably
assured. Gold revenue is recorded at an agreed upon spot price and gold ounce measurement resulting in revenue and a receivable
at the time of sale. Gold revenue is recorded net of refining charges and discounts. Sales of by-products (such as silver) are
credited to costs applicable to mining revenue.  

All
accounts receivable amounts are due from a single customer. Substantially all mining revenues recorded in the current period also
related to the same customer. As gold can be sold through numerous gold market traders worldwide, the Company is not economically
dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of its product.  

Stock
Issued For Goods and Services -  Common and preferred shares issued for goods and services are valued based upon the fair market
value of our common stock or the goods and services received, whichever is the most reliably measurable on the date of issue.  

Stock-Based
Compensation -  For stock-based transactions, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is
generally the vesting period, based on the estimated fair value on the grant date of the award.  

Income
per Common Share  - Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income, less the preferred stock dividends,
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Dilutive income per share includes any additional dilution from common
stock equivalents, such as stock options and warrants, and convertible instruments, if the impact is not antidilutive. Since the
Company incurred a net loss for the period ended December 31, 2015, all equity-linked instruments are considered anti-dilutive.
For the period ended September 30, 2016, the number of common stock equivalents is 39,932,491.  

Comprehensive
Income -  Comprehensive income is made up of the exchange differences arising on translating foreign operations and the net
income (loss) for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Derivative
Liabilities -  Derivatives liabilities are recorded at fair value when issued and the subsequent change in fair value each
period is recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. We do not hold or issue any derivative
financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.  

Income
Taxes -  The Company s income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management s best assessment
of estimated future taxes to be paid. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income
tax expense.  

Deferred
income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating
the Company s ability to recover its deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence,
including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent
financial operations. In projecting future taxable income, the Company develops assumptions including the amount of future state
and federal pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax
planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income, and are consistent
with the plans and estimates that the Company is using to manage the underlying businesses. The Company provides a valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets for which the Company does not consider realization of such deferred tax assets to be more likely than
not.  

Changes
in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of
any such changes that would have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  

Business
Segments    The Company operates in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented.  

Use
of Estimates    In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we are
required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenditures during the reported periods. Actual
results could differ materially from those estimates. Estimates may include those pertaining to valuation of inventories and mineralized
material on leach pads, the estimated useful lives and valuation of properties, plant and equipment, mineral rights and properties,
deferred tax assets, convertible preferred stock, derivative assets and liabilities, reclamation liabilities, stock-based compensation
and payments, and contingent liabilities.  

Non-Controlling
Interest Policy    Non-controlling interest (NCI) is the portion of equity ownership in a subsidiary not attributable
to the parent company, who has a controlling interest and consolidates the subsidiary s financial results with its own.
The amount of equity relating to the non-controlling interest is separately identified in the equity section of the balance sheet
and the amount of the net income (loss) relating to the non-controlling interest is separately identified on the statement of
operations.  

Reclassifications
-  Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period consolidated financial statements to conform to the current
period presentation.

stockpiles and mineralized materials on leach pads at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:  

There
were no stockpiles at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

4.
Derivative Financial Instruments   

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC subtopic 825-10,  Financial Instruments  ( ASC 825-10 ) on January 1, 2008.
ASC 825-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets
and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market
in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such
as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires
an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC
825-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in
markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level
3   Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or
liabilities.  

To
the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination
of fair value requires more judgment. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of
the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair
value measurement is disclosed and is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  

The
carrying value of the Company s cash, accounts payable, short-term borrowings (including convertible notes payable), and
other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term maturity.  

As
of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any items that would be classified as level 1 or 2 disclosures.  

All
items required to be recorded or measured on a recurring basis are based upon level 3 inputs.  

The
derivative liability as of September 30, 2016, in the amount of $13,747,916 has a level 3 classification.  

The
following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Debt
derivatives    As described above, the Company issued convertible promissory notes which are convertible into common
stock, at holders  option, at a discount to the market price of the Company s common stock. The Company has identified
the embedded derivatives related to these notes relating to certain anti-dilutive (reset) provisions. These embedded derivatives
included certain conversion features. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record
fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of debenture and to fair value as of each subsequent reporting date.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company marked to market the fair value of the debt derivatives and determined a fair value of $13,611,876.
The Company recorded a gain from change in fair value of debt derivatives of $12,759,298 for the period ended September 30, 2016.
The fair value of the embedded derivatives was determined using Binomial Option Pricing Model based on the following assumptions:
(1) dividend yield of 0%, (2) expected volatility of 190.36%, (3) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 0.29% (4) expected
life of 0.25 years, and (5) the quoted market price of the Company s common stock at each valuation date.  

Based
upon ASC 840-15-25 (EITF Issue 00-19, paragraph 11) the Company has adopted a sequencing approach regarding the application of
ASC 815-40 to its outstanding convertible notes. Pursuant to the sequencing approach, the Company evaluates its contracts based
upon earliest issuance date.  

Warrant
derivatives    The Company issued warrants in conjunction with the issuance with the Typenex, JMJ Financial and Firstfire
Global Convertible Promissory Notes. On July 15, 2016, the Company issued 180,000 warrants in conjunction with the settlement
of a convertible notes payable with Jonathan Shane. These warrants contain certain reset provisions. The accounting treatment
of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date (issuance
date) and to fair value as of each subsequent reporting date.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company marked to market the fair value of the warrant liability and determined a fair value of $136,040.
The Company recorded a gain from change in fair value of warrant liability of $77,574 for the period ended September 30, 2016.
The fair value of the warrant liability was determined using Binomial Option Pricing Model based on the following assumptions:
(1) dividend yield of 0%, (2) expected volatility of 208.41% to 222.53%, (3) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 0.87%
to 0.88% (4) expected life of 2.79 to 3.75 years, and (5) the quoted market price of the Company s common stock at each
valuation date.  

Liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized as follows:  

5.
Properties, Plant and Equipment, Net   

Properties,
plant and equipment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company recognized depreciation expense of $472,405 and $225,523,
respectively.  

6.
Mine Reclamation Liability   

The
Company is required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping, and re-vegetating various
portions of our site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in
accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.  

The
mine reclamation liability was $145,691 and $77,716 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, for our obligation
to reclaim our mine facility is based on our most recent reclamation plan, as revised, submitted and approved by the Honduran
Institute of Geology and Mines (INHGEOMIN) and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA). Such costs are based on
management s current estimate of then expected amounts for the remediation work, assuming the work is performed in accordance
with current laws and regulations and using a risk free rate of 3.74% and an inflation rate of 2%. It is reasonably possible that,
due to uncertainties associated with the application of laws and regulations by regulatory authorities and changes in reclamation
or remediation technology, the ultimate cost of reclamation and remediation could change in the future. We periodically review
the accrued reclamation liability for information indicating that our assumptions should change.  

The
increases in the reclamation liability in 2016 and 2015 were related to the expansion of the heap leach facility and related infrastructure.  

Changes to the reclamation liability were
as follows:

Introduction
to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.   

Certain
statements made in this Form 10-Q are  forward-looking statements  regarding the plans and objectives of management
for future operations. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual
results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements

that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company s plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving
the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things,
future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to
predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying
the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be
no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties
inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation
by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.  

The
forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-Q and referred to elsewhere are related to future events or our strategies
or future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may,

Form 10-Q are based on information available to us as of the filing date of this report, and the Company assumes no obligation
to update any such forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Our actual results could differ materially from the

The
interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Inception Mining Inc. ( Inception Mining 
or the  Company ) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 Commission ). Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) have
been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate
to make the information presented not misleading. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in this filing.  

In
the opinion of management, all adjustments have been made consisting of normal recurring adjustments and consolidating entries,
necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016, the
results of its consolidated statements of comprehensive income/(loss) for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, and its consolidated cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015. The results of consolidated operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the
full year.  

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Overview    

We
are a mining company that was formed in Nevada on July 2, 2007. As a mining company, we are engaged in the production of precious
metals. Our activities are not limited to production and they also include acquisition, exploration, and development of mineral
properties, primarily for gold, from owned mining properties. Inception Mining has acquired two projects, as described below.
Our target properties are those that have been the subject of historical exploration. We have generated revenue from mining operations.  

Clavo
Rico Gold Mine, Honduras, Central America     

On
October 2, 2015, the Company consummated a merger with Clavo Rico Ltd. ( Clavo Rico ). Clavo Rico is a privately held
Turks and Caicos company with principal operations in Honduras, Central America. Clavo Rico operates the Clavo Rico mining concession
through its subsidiaries Compa  a Minera Cerros del Sur, S.A de C.V. and Compa  a Minera Clavo Rico,
S.A. de C.V. and holds other mining concessions. Its workings include several historical underground mining operations dating
back to the early Mayan and Spanish occupation.  

The
Company s primary mine is a surface operation and is located on the 200-hectare Clavo Rico Concession, located in southern
Honduras. This mine was originally explored and exploited in the 16th century by the Spanish, and more recently has been operated
by Compa  a Minera Cerros del Sur, S. de R.L. as a small family business. In 2003, Clavo Rico s predecessor
purchased a 20% interest and later increased its ownership to 99.9%. This company has since invested over five million dollars
in the expansion and development of the mine and surrounding properties. Today, the Company operates this mine through exploration
of surface-level material.  

Mining
operations begin by crushing extracted material to approximately 3/8-inch size pebbles, which is then mixed with additional material
and loaded on the recovery pad for processing. The pebble material is sprinkled with a solution that leaches the gold from the
rock, and the solution is collected and processed on-site at Clavo Rico s own ADR plant. The dor  bars that result
from this process are shipped to the USA for refining.  

Prior
to the expansion, the mine had been processing approximately 500 tons of extracted material per month. The current recovery operation
has been sized to handle from 500 to 1,000 tons of extracted material per day on a recovery bed that has the capacity to receive
up to 500,000 tons of material. This expansion represents a sizeable increase in capacity. The company commenced full operations
on January 1, 2012 and believes that sufficiently high gold content ore bodies have been located and blocked out to load the recovery
bed to capacity by the end of 2017. The Company has engaged in preliminary drilling of this area and the resulting assays of samples
indicate that the material should have grades in the range of 0-5 grams of gold per ton.  

During
the period covered under this Quarterly Report, the Company extracted 29,546.22 tons of material from its surface operation, with
an average grade of 2.86 grams of gold per ton and 2.25 grams of silver per ton. After processing this material using the on-site
leach pad, the Company produced 1470.28 ounces of gold and 1090.99 ounces of silver for assaying and refining, for a recovery
percentage of 54.2%.  

The
Company utilizes four distinct properties located at the Clavo Rico Concession: the main Clavo Rico property, where extraction,
leaching, and processing occurs, and the Modesto, Loli, and Juan Carlos Williams properties, used as extraction sites. The Modesto
location was acquired by the Company pursuant to a real estate purchase agreement in December 2015. The Company is permitted access
to the Loli and Juan Carlos Williams properties pursuant to informal oral agreements.  

The
Company relies heavily on the neighboring communities that support Clavo Rico mine operations. El Corpus, a small village situated
just below the mine, is one such community. To show its gratitude for the support of these people, many of whom are employed by
the mine, the Company is committed to care for their holistic well-being. To that end, Inception undertakes many efforts to maintain
a high quality of life for every living thing in the area, including reforestation of trees and vegetation; proper treatment and
disposal of mine wastewater; wildlife awareness and preservation; and encouraging education in the community through a trade school
built and operated by the Company.  

UP
  Burlington Gold Mine, Salmon, Lemhi County, Idaho     

On
February 25, 2013 the Company acquired certain real property and the associated exploration permits and mineral rights commonly
known as the UP and Burlington Gold Mine ( UP   Burlington ) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The Company
owns and controls this property exclusively; there are no third parties who impose conditions of any kind on operations at this
location. We are presently in the exploration stage at UP   Burlington. UP   Burlington contains two federal patented
mining claims, which Inception Resources acquired for the purpose of the exploration and potential development of gold on the
40 acres that comprise this property. Production at this mine is subject to a 3% net smelter royalty, which may increase or decrease
depending on the amount of gold produced.  

Discovered
in 1892, UP   Burlington is a private gold property that has been held unused in a family trust for the past 75 years. UP
  Burlington is located in Lemhi County, Northwest of Salmon, Idaho, at an elevation of 3,994 feet. The UP   Burlington
site is located six miles from the city of Salmon; is 0.6 miles away from the closest major road (Ridge Road); and is 1.56 miles
away from the closest major power line. We believe Salmon, along with the surrounding County of Lemhi, provides an excellent infrastructure
for our mine. Salmon has a population of 3,122 and Lemhi County has a population of 7,806. In September 2011, heavy maintenance
and right-of-way repair was completed and a new road to UP   Burlington was constructed.  

UP
  Burlington s two gold mining claims were brought to patent in 1900, which covers the Mine s 40 acres. Subsequently,
in 1989, a U.S. Forest Survey was performed on the UP   Burlington site confirming that the patented claims cover an area
that is six hundred feet by three thousand feet (600 x3000 ). The Mine s patented claims remove the challenges
associated when working on U.S. Forest lands, Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ), state or other property types. With
our purchase of UP   Burlington, we have the benefit of working on private land, which requires only a hauling/road permit
to commence significant operations.  

The
Company has obtained the necessary permitting, cut additional access roads, made surface improvements, and initiated surface mining
on a 2,500 foot per day lighted vein for bulk sampling, vein definition and ore valuation. In Phase II, we plan to contract an
underground mining and operations plan, expand portal development leveraging existing underground access, and implement underground
mining to a depth based on optimizing costs versus processed ore value. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in implementing
any stage of our plans.  

Our
tactical plan includes obtaining a Lemhi County Conditional Use Permit, an Idaho Department of Lands Surface Reclamation Bond,
and permitting for the U.S. Forest Service Access Road, as well as obtaining major contracts such as geotechnical contracts, surface
mining contracts, toll processing contracts and underground mine plan contracts.  

The
Company and its independent consultants are in the process of developing a detailed exploration-drilling program to confirm and
expand mineralized zones in the Mine and collect additional environmental and technical data. The first phase of began in 2013.
The Company intends to continue drilling, metallurgical testing, engineering and environmental programs and studies and has updated
the historic feasibility study and environmental permit applications.  

Nevada
Exploration     

The
Company had previously disclosed exploration in the Northern Nevada Rift through a partner. All exploration in these areas has
ceased and the Company has no plans to pursue exploration in this area at this time.  

Results
of Operations   

Nine-months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine-months ended September 30, 2015   

We had a net income of $8,656,767 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, and a net income of
$878,884 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. This change in our results over the two periods is primarily the result
of increased precious metal production, fewer professional and consulting agreements, where the Company utilizes the expertise,
professional relationships, and knowledge of said consultants, are classified as general and administrative expenses that have
been entered into, as well as the decrease in exploration costs, changes in derivatives and the changes in debt discounts which
are included in other income/expense. The following table summarizes key items of comparison and their related increase (decrease)
for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Three-months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three-months ended September 30, 2015   

We had a net loss of $5,355,978 for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, and a net income of $312,816
for the three-months ended September 30, 2015. This change in our results over the two periods is primarily the result of increased
precious metal production, fewer professional and consulting agreements, where the Company utilizes the expertise, professional
relationships, and knowledge of said consultants, are classified as general and administrative expenses that have been entered
into, as well as the decrease in exploration costs, changes in derivatives and the changes in debt discounts which are included
in other income/expense. The following table summarizes key items of comparison and their related increase (decrease) for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Our
balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 reflects assets of $3,463,445. We had cash in the amount of $466,617 and working capital
deficit in the amount of $23,530,269 as of September 30, 2016. Thus, we do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to
carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months. We will need to raise approximately $2,000,000 in order to
fully implement our business plan.  

Working
Capital   

We
anticipate generating losses and, therefore, may be unable to continue operations in the future, if we don t acquire additional
capital and issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party.  

Going
Concern Consideration   

As
reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company and has an accumulated deficit
of $21,697,296. In addition, there is a working capital deficit of $23,530,269 as of September 30, 2016. This raises substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

Operating
Activities   

Net cash flow provided by operating activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $593,250, a decrease of $86,440 from the $679,690 net cash provided during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in the cash provided by operating activities was primarily due
to the increase in cost of precious metals production by the Company. 

Investing
Activities   

Investing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 used $133,070, an decrease of $704,492 from the $837,562 used by investing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased $133,070
in fixed assets. 

Financing
Activities   

Financing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 used $124,498, a decrease of $324,498 from the $200,000 provided by financing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $1,710,000
in proceeds from a short-term note. The Company also made $2,561,190 in payments on notes payable, including the short-term notes
payable, payments of $194,500 to convertible notes payable. 

We
are currently seeking up to $20,000,000 in debt or equity financing in order to fully implement our business plan.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the
United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application
of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the
following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials.  

Costs
of acquiring mining properties and any exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred unless proven and probable reserves
exist and the property is a commercially mineable property. Mine development costs incurred either to develop new gold and silver
deposits, expand the capacity of operating mines, or to develop mine areas substantially in advance of current production are
capitalized. Costs incurred to maintain current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations.
Costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment. The Company evaluates, at least quarterly, the carrying
value of capitalized mining costs and related property, plant and equipment costs, if any, to determine if these costs are in
excess of their net realizable value and if a permanent impairment needs to be recorded. The periodic evaluation of carrying value
of capitalized costs and any related property, plant and equipment costs are based upon expected future cash flows and/or estimated
salvage value.  

The
Company capitalizes costs for mining properties by individual property and defers such costs for later amortization only if the
prospects for economic productions are reasonably certain. Capitalized costs are expensed in the period when the determination
has been made that economic production does not appear reasonably certain.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

For
recent accounting pronouncements, please refer to the notes to financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include disclosure under this item.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in
our periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer (principal financial officer),
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under
the 1934 Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, because of the Company s limited
resources and limited number of employees, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of September 30, 2016.  

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the financial statements of the Company in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, or GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

With
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). Based on our evaluation
and the material weaknesses described below, management concluded that the Company s internal controls were not effective
based on financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 based on the COSO framework criteria. Management has
identified control deficiencies regarding the lack of segregation of duties, tax compliance issues and the need for a stronger
internal control environment. Management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the
Company s accounting staff and reliance on outside consultants for external reporting. The small size of the Company s
accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future, such as segregation of duties, due to the cost/benefit of such remediation.  

To
mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions,
along with the use of legal and outside accounting consultants. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which
will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework.  

These
control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement to our consolidated financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, we have
determined that these control deficiencies as described above together constitute a material weakness.  

In
light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our consolidated financial
statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated in accordance
with US GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses, our consolidated financial statements for
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP.  

This
Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly
Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS   

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued the following equity securities:  

On
July 15, 2016, the Company issued 9,090 shares of common stock to Jonathan Shane per a negotiated debt settlement agreement.  These
shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder since, among other things, the transactions
did not involve a public offering.   

On
July 29, 2016, 881,057 shares of common stock were issued for the conversion of debt obligation to Trent D Ambrosio.  These
shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended pursuant
to Section 3(a)(9) of the Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder since, among other things, the transactions
did not involve a public offering.   

On
August 8, 2016, the Company issued 150,000 shares of common stock to Red Rock Marketing Media, Inc. pursuant to a consulting agreement.
 These shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder
since, among other things, the transactions did not involve a public offering.   

On
September 6, 2016, the Company issued 150,000 shares of common stock per the consulting agreement with Red Rock Marketing Media,
Inc.  These shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements

since, among other things, the transactions did not involve a public offering.   

ITEM
3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES   

None.  

ITEM
4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES   

Not
applicable as the Company conducts no mining operations in the U.S. or its territories.  

ITEM
5. OTHER INFORMATION   

On
August 30, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company, pursuant to Article II of the Company s Articles of Incorporation,
approved the designation of fifty-one (51) shares of its authorized capital stock as  Series A Preferred Stock . The
Certificate of Designation for the Series A Preferred Stock was filed on August 31, 2016. As of the date of this filing, there
are no shares of preferred stock issued.  

     Effective
                                         October 2, 2016, the Company renegotiated the convertible notes payable containing derivative
                                         features that were assumed in the Merger that closed October 2, 2016 (including those
                                         promissory notes issued to Claymore Management, GAIA Ltd, Legends Capital, LWB Irrevocable
                                         Trust, MDL Ventures, LLC, and Silverbrook Corporation). These Note Amendment and Extension
                                         Agreements amended the terms of the original notes by removing the conversion feature
                                         entirely and extending the payment due date until December 31, 2017. All remaining characteristics
                                         of the original notes remained the same. As a result of these Note Amendments and Extension
                                         Agreements being executed, the Company will recognize a gain on extinguishment of debt
                                         and a gain in the change in derivative liability for the period ending December 31, 2016.  

On
November 21, 2016, the Company filed a 10-K/A with restated financials to correct a miscalculation in the Company s derivative
liability. The Company believes that the Note Amendments and Extension Agreements it negotiated with its noteholders will benefit
the Company by removing the conversion feature and thereby reducing the complexity of the calculation of the Company s derivative
liability in the future and likely resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt and a gain in the change in derivative liability
for next reporting period.
