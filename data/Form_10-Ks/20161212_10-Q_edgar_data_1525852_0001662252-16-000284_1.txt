Description of Business   

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 30, 2010 originally under the name Lifetech Industries, Inc. Effective August 2, 2013, the name was changed from "Lifetech Industries, Inc." to "mCig, Inc." reflecting the new business model.  

All agreements related to the Lifetech business were terminated and closed as of April 30, 2014. It will not have any impact on the current and future operations because all of these agreements are related to the previous business directions of the Company.  

Since 2013, the Company manufactures, markets, and distributes electronic cigarettes, vaporizers, and accessories under the mCig brand name in the United States. It offers electronic cigarettes and related products through its online store mcig.org, as well as through the company s wholesale, distributor, and retail programs.  

In FY 2016 the Company expanded its products and services to include construction management. The Company continues to look at strategic acquisitions and product and service developments for future growth.  

Subsidiaries of the Company   

The Company's current business operations are conducted through three subsidiaries; Scalable Solutions, LLC, VitaCig, Inc., and mCig Internet Sales, Inc.  

VitaCig, Inc.   

We distribute and wholesale the VitaCig product lines   affordable loose-leaf eCigs. Designed in the USA   with unique formulas, trade secrets, VitaCig provides a smoking experience by heating plant material, waxes, and oils delivering a smoother inhalation experience.  

On June 22, 2016 the Company acquired the business operations from VitaCig, Inc., in exchange for 172,500,000 shares of stock of VitaCig, Inc., owned by the Company and $91,276, which was a drawdown of the outstanding balance owed by VitaCig, Inc., to the Company.  

Scalable Solutions, LLC   

Scalable Solutions, LLC was organized by the Company on March 6, 2016, provides construction services in the cultivation and growing industry. Scalable began operations in December 2015, but was not officially incorporated until March 2016. The Company owns 80% of Scalable. Zoha Development, LLC maintains an option to acquire 40% of Scalable for a nominal fee.  

     7     

mCig Internet Sales, Inc.   

On June 1, 2016, the Company incorporated mCig Internet Sales, Inc., ( mCig Internet ) in order to consolidate all online retail sales from various websites and to provide streamlining of administrative and documentation services, consolidation of inventories, and support economy of scale.  

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Principles of Consolidation   

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the wholly owned subsidiaries of mCig Internet Sales, Inc., and VitaCig, Inc., and the majority owned subsidiary of Scalable Solutions, LLC for the quarter ended October 31, 2016. Significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Inventory   

Inventory consists of finished product, mCig products valued at the lower of cost or market valuation under the first-in, first-out method of costing.     

Accounts Receivable   

The Company s accounts receivable is primarily from its vendor tasked with accepting all credit card payments for purchases from its customers, and are held in escrow for potential chargebacks, and are reported at the amount due from the vendor. The Company did not report any accounts receivable from any of its retail customers.  

Intangible Assets   

The Company s intangible assets consist primarily of certain website development costs and domain urls, and are amortized over their useful life. 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share   

The Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for earnings per share. Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) calculations are determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the three months. Diluted earnings per share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation.  

There are 38,532,412 shares in warrants and 16,000,000 shares in stock options in dilutive security as of October 31, 2016 and zero dilutive security or April 30, 2016.  

Concentration of Credit Risk   

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and trade receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the clients that comprise our customer base and their dispersion across different business and geographic areas. We estimate and maintain an allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts and such estimates have historically been within management's expectations. 

We rely almost exclusively on one Chinese factory as our principle supplier, for the manufacturing of mCig s. Therefore, our ability to maintain operations is dependent on this third-party manufacturer.  

Our cash balances are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located in the United States. The Company may occasionally maintain amounts on deposit with a financial institution that are in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000. The risk is managed by maintaining all deposits in high quality financial institutions. The Company had no deposits in excess of federally insured limits at October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016.

Cost-Basis Investments   

The Company s non-marketable equity investment in Vapolution, Inc., is recorded using the cost-basis method of accounting, and is classified within other long-term assets on the accompanying balance sheet as permitted by FASB ASC 325,  Cost Method Investments . During the three months ended October 31, 2016 there were no impairment losses.  

On September 30, 2015, the Company issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock valued at $67,500 for the second half of the Vapolution investment.  

The Company accounts for its approximately 8% ownership of Omni Health, Inc., (fka VitaCig, Inc.) as an  cost-basis investment. On October 31, 2016 the Company converted its Convertible Promissory Note into equity of Omni Health, Inc. As of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, there is a net book value of $152,023 and 0, respectively of the ownership of Omni Health, Inc.  

On June 22, 2016 the Company reduced its ownership of Omni Health, Inc., to 57,500,000 through a Separation and Transfer Agreement where the Company acquired the business operations of VitaCig in exchange for selling back to the treasury of Omni Health, Inc., 172,500,000 common shares. As a condition to the action, the Company s shares are non-dilutive for a period of 12 months.  

Warranties   

Warranty reserves include management s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact the Company s evaluation of historical data. Management reviews mCig s reserves at least quarterly to ensure that its accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and the Company will adjust its estimates as needed. Initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch of a product and accordingly, the adjustments that are recorded may be material.. As a result, the products that can be returned as a warranty replacement are extremely limited. As a result, due to the Company s warranty policy, the Company did not have any significant warranty expenses to report for the quarter ended October 31, 2016. Based on these actual expenses, the warranty reserve, as estimated by management as of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016 were at $0. Any adjustments to warranty reserves are to be recorded in cost of sales.  

Segment Information   

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company is required to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments. The Company identifies its operating segments as divisions based on how management internally evaluates separate financial information, business activities and management responsibility. In addition to the corporate segment, the Company segments and the subsidiaries associated with each segment are as follows:    

Segment    

Subsidiary     

Construction

mCig Internet Sales, Inc.    

Wholesale   

VitaCig, Inc.       

Note 3. Going Concern   

The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Because the business is new and has a limited history and relatively few sales, no certainty of continuation can be stated. The accompanying financial statements for the three months and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

The Company has suffered losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  

Management is taking steps to raise additional funds to address its operating and financial cash requirements to continue operations in the next twelve months. Management has devoted a significant amount of time in the raising of capital from additional debt and equity financing. However, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is not dependent upon raising additional funds through debt and equity financing and generating revenue. There are no assurances the Company will receive the necessary funding or generate revenue necessary to fund operations. The financial statements contain no adjustments for the outcome of this uncertainty. 

       9        

Note 4. Notes Payable   

On June 15, 2016, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $25,000 for future legal work. The note is due on June 14, 2017 and bears interest at 10% per annum. The loan becomes convertible 180 days after date of the note. The loan can then be converted into shares of the Company s common stock at a rate of 80% multiplied by the market price, which is the average of the closing price on the preceding five (5) trading days.  On October 3, 2016 the Company entered into agreement with the Note Holder to convert the promissory note into restricted common shares of the Company at market price and without interest.   

Note 5. Property, Plant and Equipment

Note 7. Business Segments  

This summary reflects the Company's current segments, as described below.

The parent company provides overall management and corporate reporting functions for the entire organization.

We will continue to expand our offering in the construction and modular facilities in multiple facets as the industry continues to seek better and improved ways of production.

The wholesale division works with mass distribution channels in eCig, wholesale CBD, marijuana cigarettes (Rollies), and all other operations not directly classified in the other reportable segments. 

Information concerning the revenues and operating income (loss) for the three months and six months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, and the identifiable assets for the segments in which the Company operates are shown in the following table: 

10     

Note 8. Non-GAAP Accounting and GAAP Reconciliation   Net Income and EBITDA  

The Company reports all financial information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company believes, however, that evaluating its ongoing operating results will be enhanced if it also discloses certain non-GAAP information because it is useful to understand MCIG s performance that many investors believe may obscure MCIG s ongoing operational results.  

For example, MCIG uses non-GAAP net income (Adjusted Net Income), which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets, costs from acquisitions, restructurings and other infrequently occurring  items, non-cash deferred tax provision and litigation and related settlement costs. MCIG uses EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, which adjusts net income (loss) for amortization of intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, costs related to acquisitions, restructuring and other infrequently occurring items, settlement of litigation, gains or losses on dispositions, pro forma adjustments to exclude lines of business that have been acquired during the periods presented, current cash tax provision, depreciation, and interest expense (income), net.  

The company believes that excluding certain costs from Adjusted Net Income and EBITDA provides a meaningful indication to investors of the expected on-going operating performance of the company. Whenever MCIG uses such historical non-GAAP financial measures, it provides a reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 

The following tables reflect the non-GAAP Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three month period and six months ending October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.    

The following tables is a reconciliation of the EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP measures) to the Net Income with the GAAP Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three month period and six months ending October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.     

Note 9. Acquisitions   

VitaCig, Inc.

The purchase price of VitaCig was $68,123.  The purchase price was derived from the amount of the reduction in Due from VitaCig in excess of $95,000.  In addition, the company returned 172,500,000 shares of VitaCig Common Stock which had no recorded net present value.

Overview  

mCig, Inc. (mCig) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 30, 2010 originally under the name Lifetech Industries, Inc. Effective August 2, 2013, the name was changed from "Lifetech Industries, Inc." to "mCig, Inc." reflecting the new business model. Since October 2013, we have positioned ourselves as a company focused on two long-term secular trends:  

(1) the decriminalization and legalization of marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes - legalizing medicinal and recreational marijuana usage is steadily on the rise not only domestically but also internationally. Marijuana has been decriminalized in over twenty countries, in over five continents.  

On November 8, 2016, as management predicted, eight of the nine states who had referendums for the legalization of marijuana, either for medical purposes and recreational use passed.  Management believes that due to these measure the marijuana industry will quadruple in size in a relatively short period of time.       

(2) The adoption of electronic vaporizing cigarettes (commonly known as  eCigs ), as smokers move away from traditional cigarettes onto e-cigarettes. Smoking tobacco causes numerous health problems, including disease and death. Smoking becomes very addicting quickly, and the most difficult part is cessation. The Company contends that e-cigarettes offer a safer and healthier alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes. E-cigarettes operate by heating a mixture of liquid nicotine and flavoring, which is then inhaled and exhaled in the same manner as a cigarette. However, e-cigarettes do not contain any tobacco or other dangerous additives. Scientific research has shown that the leading cause of cancer in smokers comes from the carcinogens in tobacco. As the movement towards personal health grows, smokers are trying to quit their harmful habits.  

Since 2013, the Company manufactures, markets, and distributes electronic cigarettes, vaporizers, and accessories under the mCig brand name in the United States. It offers electronic cigarettes and related products through its online store mcig.org, as well as through the company s wholesale, distributor, and retail programs.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to uncollectible receivables, inventory valuation, deferred compensation and contingencies.   

We base our estimates on historical performance and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  These estimates allow us to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 

We believe the following accounting policies are our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that may be uncertain.  If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. 

15     

Revenue Recognition  

Our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which requires the recognition of sales when there is evidence of a sales agreement, the delivery of goods has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determined and the collectability of revenue is reasonably assured. 

The Company recognizes revenue for sales online either direct to consumer or through our Wholesaler, Distributor, Reseller (WDR) program. For online sales, revenue is recognized by the Company at the time of order fulfillment. Since mCig collects payment for each online order at the time of sale, the point of shipping revenue recognition method ensures that the Company recognizes the revenue collected within 24-48 hours after the order is received and the funds are collected.  

Amounts billed or collected in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. 

Operating Results   

Our operating results for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:    

Adjusted Net Income   

Our adjusted operating results for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:    

Adjusted Operating Expenses  

Our adjusted operating expenses decreased by $405,799 to $216,088 for the six months ended October 31, 2016, from $621,887 for the six months ended October 31, 2015. 

The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $408,958.  There was an increase in professional fees of $2,249 and an increase in amortization and depreciation of $921. 

Our total adjusted operating expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2016 of $507,682 consisted of $85,436 of selling, general and administrative expenses, $21,930 of professional fees, $107,812 in consulting fees, and $921 in depreciation expenses. Our general and administrative expenses consist of professional fees, bank charges, telephone expenses, meals and entertainments, computer and internet expenses, postage and delivery, office supplies and other expenses. 

Adjusted Net Income/Loss  

We generated an adjusted net income of $131,279 for the six months ended October 31, 2016, while we generated a net loss of $393,267 for the six months ending October 31, 2015, a net improvement of $524,546. The net improvement in net income compared to the prior period s net loss is primarily a result of the decrease in operating expenses of $401,799 and the increase in gross profit of $64,832, the gain from conversion of convertible promissory note of $53,915, and an increase in interest income of $3,108. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that we consider material.  

Going Concern   

Our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Because the business is relatively new and has a short history and relatively few sales, no certainty of continuation can be stated. The accompanying financial statements for the three months and six months ended October 31, 2016 have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company has suffered losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

We are a smaller reporting company and therefore, we are not required to provide information required by this Item of Form 10-Q.  

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2016. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.  

Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives. Additionally, in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures, management is required to apply its reasonable judgment. Based on the evaluation described above, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report because we did not document our Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 internal controls and procedures. 

As funds become available to us, we expect to implement additional measures to improve disclosure controls and procedures such as implementing and documenting our internal controls procedures.  

20     

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting   

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls     

A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met.  The Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and its Principal Financial Officer, do not expect that the Company s disclosure controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.  The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION     

Item 1. Legal Proceedings   

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Except as set forth below we are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.  

Item 1A. Risk Factors   

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.  

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
