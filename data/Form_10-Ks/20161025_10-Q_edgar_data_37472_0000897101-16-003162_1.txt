  FOR
THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

1.    The
                                         consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Flexsteel Industries,
                                         Inc. and Subsidiaries (the  Company  or  Flexsteel ), without
                                         audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
                                         ( SEC ). The information furnished in the consolidated financial statements
                                         includes normal recurring adjustments and reflects all adjustments, which are, in the
                                         opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of such consolidated financial
                                         statements. Operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily
                                         indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.
                                         Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial
                                         statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
                                         United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant
                                         to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are
                                         adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Except to the extent updated
                                         or described below, the significant accounting policies set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated
                                         financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
                                         June 30, 2016, appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status
                                         of accounting policies and are incorporated by reference.    

DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS   Flexsteel was incorporated in 1929 and is one of the oldest and largest manufacturers, importers and marketers
of residential and commercial upholstered and wood furniture products in the United States. Product offerings include a wide variety
of upholstered and wood furniture such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, reclining and rocker-reclining chairs, swivel rockers, sofa
beds, convertible bedding units, occasional tables, desks, dining tables and chairs and bedroom furniture. The Company s
products are intended for use in home, office, hotel, healthcare and other commercial applications. A featured component in most
of the upholstered furniture is a unique steel drop-in seat spring from which our name  Flexsteel  is derived. The
Company distributes its products throughout the United States through the Company s sales force and various independent
representatives.  

2.    INVENTORIES   

A
comparison of inventories is as follows:  

3.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

The
Company s cash, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, notes payable and certain accrued liabilities
are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. Generally accepted accounting
principles on fair value measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities require that each asset and liability carried
at fair value be classified into one of the following categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical
assets and liabilities; Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; or
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in
measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period.  

The
Company maintains unfunded supplemental retirement plans, collectively referred to as the Supplemental Plan, which provides for
additional annual defined contributions toward retirement benefits to certain of the Company s executive officers. Funds
of the Supplemental Plan are held in a Rabbi Trust. The assets held in the Rabbi Trust are not available for general corporate
purposes. The Rabbi Trust is subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency, but otherwise must be used only for purposes
of providing benefits under the plans. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s Supplemental Plan assets, held in the Rabbi
Trust, were invested in stock and bond funds and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair market value. As of September
30, 2016, the Supplemental Plan assets were $1.7 million, with $0.8 million of the Supplemental Plan assets classified as  other
current assets  and $0.9 million as  other assets  in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2016,
the Supplemental Plan assets were $2.3 million, with $1.5 million classified as  other current assets  and $0.8 million
classified as  other assets  in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are classified as Level 2 in accordance
with fair value measurements as described above.  

4   

4.    CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS   

The
Company maintains an unsecured credit agreement that provides short-term working capital financing up to $10.0 million with interest
of LIBOR plus 1% (1.53% at September 30, 2016), including up to $4.0 million of letters of credit. Letters of credit outstanding
at September 30, 2016, totaled $2.3 million. Other than the aforementioned letters of credit, the Company did not utilize borrowing
availability under the credit facility, leaving borrowing availability of $7.7 million as of September 30, 2016. The credit agreement
expires June 30, 2017. At September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained in the
credit agreement.  

A
director of the Company is a director at a bank where the Company maintains an additional unsecured $10.0 million line of credit,
with interest at prime minus 2% (1.50% at September 30, 2016), and where its routine banking transactions are processed. No amount
was outstanding on the line of credit at September 30, 2016. This line of credit matures December 31, 2016. In addition, the supplemental
retirement plan assets, held in a Rabbi Trust, of $1.7 million are administered by this bank s trust department. The Company
receives no special services or pricing on the services performed by the bank due to the directorship of this director.  

5.    STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  

The
Company has two stock-based compensation methods available when determining employee compensation.  

(1)       Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans   

The
long-term incentive compensation plan provides for shares of common stock to be awarded to officers and key employees based
on performance targets set by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the  Committee ). In December
2013, the Company s shareholders approved 700,000 shares to be issued under the plan. As of September 30, 2016, 61,969
shares have been issued. The Committee selected fully-diluted earnings per share as the performance goal for the three-year
performance periods July 1, 2014   June 30, 2017 (2015-2017) and July 1, 2015   June 30, 2018 (2016-2018). The
Committee selected fully-diluted earnings per share and total shareholder return as the performance goals for the three-year
performance period July 1, 2016   June 30, 2019 (2017-2019). Stock awards will be issued to participants as soon as practicable
following the end of the performance periods subject to verification of results and Committee approval. The compensation cost
related to the number of shares to be granted under each performance period is fixed on the grant date, which is the date the
performance period begins.  

The
Company recorded expense of $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.
If the target performance goals for 2015-2017, 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 would be achieved, the total amount of compensation cost
recognized over the requisite performance periods would be $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively.  

(2)       Stock Plans   

Omnibus
Stock Plan   

The
Omnibus Stock Plan is for key employees, officers and directors and provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and performance units. In December 2013, the Company s
shareholders approved 700,000 shares to be issued under the plan.  

Under
the plans, options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date
of grant and exercisable for up to 10 years. All options were exercisable when granted. It is the Company s policy to issue
new shares upon exercise of stock options. The Company accepts shares of the Company s common stock as payment for the exercise
price of options. Shares received as payment are retired upon receipt. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015, $0.3 million and $0.2 million was expensed related to stock option grants, respectively.  

5   

The
Company issued 1,778 shares to non-executive directors as compensation and recorded expense of $0.1 million during the quarter
ended September 30, 2016. No shares were issued to directors during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  

At
September 30, 2016, 541,307 shares were available for future grants under the plan.  

2002,
2006 and 2009 Stock Option Plans   

The
stock option plans were for key employees, officers and directors and provided for granting incentive and nonqualified stock options.
Under the plans, options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the
date of grant and exercisable for up to 10 years. All options were exercisable when granted. No additional options can be granted
under the 2002, 2006 and 2009 stock option plans.  

A
summary of the status of the Company s stock plans as of June 30, 2015 and 2016, and September 30, 2016, and the changes
during the periods then ended is presented below:  

The
following table summarizes information for options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016:  

6.    EARNINGS PER SHARE  

Basic
earnings per share (EPS) of common stock are based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
Diluted earnings per share of common stock include the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding. The Company s
potential common shares outstanding are stock options, shares associated with the long-term management incentive compensation
plan and non-vested shares. The Company calculates the dilutive effect of outstanding options using the treasury stock method.
Anti-dilutive shares are not included in the computation of diluted EPS when their exercise price is greater than the average
closing market price of the common shares. The Company calculates the dilutive effect of shares related to the long-term management
incentive compensation plan and non-vested shares based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable if the end of
the fiscal period were the end of the contingency period.  

6   

In
computing EPS for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net income as reported for each respective period is divided
by the fully diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding:  

7.   
LITIGATION  

Indiana
Civil Litigation     In December 2013, the Company entered into a confidential agreement to settle the Indiana Civil
Litigation. During each of the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $0.1 million of legal
expenses pursuing insurance coverage. These expenses are included in  selling, general and administrative 
(SG A) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

The
Company continues to pursue the recovery of defense and settlement costs from insurance carriers. Based on policy language, insurance
coverage is in question. Coverage litigation is proceeding against the insurance carriers in Indiana.  

In
March 2016, the Company received a General Notice Letter for the Lane Street Groundwater Superfund Site located in Elkhart, Indiana
from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA has determined that the Company may be a responsible party
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The Company continues to believe that
it did not cause or contribute to the contamination. In April 2016, the EPA issued their proposed clean-up plan for groundwater
pollution and request for public comment. The Company responded to the request for public comment in May 2016. The EPA issued
a Record of Decision in August 2016 and estimated total costs to remediate of $3.6 million. As of September 30, 2016, the EPA
has not issued a special notice letter to Flexsteel which would indicate the EPA s intent to pursue Flexsteel for contribution
to the remediation cost. The Company has not recorded a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets because it is not possible
to reasonably estimate the amount, if any, of the estimated remediation cost as responsible parties have not been named by the
EPA.  

Other
Proceedings    From time to time, the Company is subject to various other legal proceedings, including lawsuits, which
arise out of, and are incidental to, the conduct of the Company s business. The Company does not consider any of such other
proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to its business or likely to result in
a material effect on its consolidated operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.  

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

GENERAL:  

The
following analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  

7   

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES:  

There
have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7,  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K.  

Overview   

The
following table has been prepared as an aid in understanding the Company s results of operations on a comparative basis
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Amounts presented are percentages of the Company s net sales.  

Results
of Operations for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2016 vs. 2015    

The
following table compares net sales for the quarter ended September 30, (in millions):  

Net
sales were $112.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the second highest first quarter, compared to $126.5 million
in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 11.4%. The residential and commercial net sales decreases were substantially due to lower
volume in the current quarter. Residential net sales for the quarter-ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $3 million
of net sales related to clearing the west coast port congestion. The current year quarter was negatively impacted by approximately
$6 million primarily due to discontinuing select leather imports that failed to meet Flexsteel s quality standards and delayed
availability of technology components for new products. Casegoods net sales declined approximately $4 million reflecting continued
weak demand at retail.   

Gross
margin as a percent of net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was 23.8% compared to 22.0% for the prior year quarter.
Gross margin improvements were partially offset by lower absorption of fixed costs.  

Selling,
general and administrative (SG A) expenses were 16.9% of net sales in the current year quarter, compared to 14.6% of net sales
in the prior year quarter. SG A expenses increased $1.1 million or 1.0% of net sales to enhance the consumer brand experience
at retail. The Company expended $0.5 million or 0.4% of net sales upgrading its business information system. The increase in SG A
as a percentage of net sales also reflects lower fixed cost leverage on decreased sales volume.  

The
effective income rate was 38.7% and 38.0% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The
above factors resulted in net income of $4.8 million or $0.61 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$5.8 million or $0.74 per share in the prior year quarter.  

All
earnings per share amounts are on a diluted basis.  

8   

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Working
capital (current assets less current liabilities) at September 30, 2016 was $145.7 million compared to $143.1 million at June
30, 2016. Primary changes in working capital include increases in cash of $5.9 million and accounts payable of $2.3 million and
decreases in payroll and related items of $2.2 million, other current assets of $1.9 million and accounts receivable of $1.8 million.  

For
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, capital expenditures were $4.5 million including $3.9 million for the upgrade of the Company s
business information system. Dividend payments were $1.4 million for the Company s 298th consecutive dividend.  

The
Company maintained a credit agreement which provided unsecured short-term working capital financing up to $10.0 million with interest
of LIBOR plus 1% (1.53% at September 30, 2016), including up to $4.0 million of letters of credit. Letters of credit outstanding
at September 30, 2016 totaled $2.3 million, leaving borrowing availability of $7.7 million. The credit agreement expires June
30, 2017.  

The
Company maintains an additional unsecured $10.0 million line of credit, with interest at prime minus 2% (1.5% at September 30,
2016). No amount was outstanding on the line of credit at September 30, 2016. This line of credit matures December 31, 2016.  

Net
cash provided by operating activities of $11.2 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was comprised primarily of net
income of $4.8 million, depreciation of $2.0 million, accounts payable increase of $2.3 million, and decreases in accounts receivable
of $1.9 million and other current assets of $1.2 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter ended September
30, 2015 was $8.5 million.  

Net
cash used in investing activities was $4.5 million and $2.1 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Capital expenditures were $4.5 million and $2.1 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Net
cash used in financing activities was $0.9 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to dividends paid of
$1.4 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $5.8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015 primarily from repayments
of current borrowings of $5.1 million and dividends paid of $1.3 million.  

Capital
expenditures are estimated to be $13 million for the remainder of fiscal 2017. Management believes that the Company has adequate
cash flows from operations and credit arrangements to meet its operating and capital requirements for fiscal year 2017. In the
opinion of management, the Company s liquidity and credit resources provide it with the ability to react to opportunities
as they arise, to pay quarterly dividends to its shareholders, and to purchase productive capital assets that enhance safety and
improve operations.  

Contractual
Obligations   

As
of September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations presented in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.  

Outlook   

The
Company believes that demand for furniture products in the United States will continue to be weak due to economic uncertainty
for the remainder of the fiscal year. During the first half of fiscal year 2016, the Company reported $6 million increase in net
sales related to clearing of west coast port congestion. Net sales for the Company are expected to remain soft for the next fiscal
quarter. The Company is focusing on streamlining product introductions to increase sales and controlling discretionary spending.  

For
the remainder of fiscal year 2017, the Company expects to have the following expenditures:  

$10 million for capital
expenditures and $3 million as SG A expense for upgrading its business information system to better meet market conditions,
customer requirements and increase operating efficiency; and  

$3 million in operating capital expenditures.

The
Company remains committed to its core strategies, which include providing a wide range of quality product offerings and price
points to the residential and commercial markets, combined with a conservative approach to business. The Company will maintain
its focus on a strong balance sheet through emphasis on cash flow and increasing profitability. The Company believes these core
strategies are in the best interest of our shareholders.  

Item
3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

General
   Market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused
by fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. As discussed below, management of the Company does
not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the Company s results of operations or cash
flows. The ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers
are located, disruptions associated with shipping distances and negotiations with port employees. Other risks related to furniture
product importation include government imposition of regulations and/or quotas; duties and taxes on imports; and significant fluctuation
in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Any of these factors could interrupt supply, increase costs and decrease
earnings.  

Inflation
   Increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined
by the marketplace. Inflation or other pricing pressures could impact raw material costs, labor costs and interest rates which
are important components of costs for the Company and could have an adverse effect on our profitability, especially where increases
in these costs exceed price increases on finished products.  

Foreign
Currency Risk    During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have sales, but has purchases
and other expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices is not
considered significant.  

Interest
Rate Risk    The Company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest
rates. At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any debt outstanding.  

Item
4.      Controls and Procedures  

(a)
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective
as of September 30, 2016.  

(b)
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no significant
changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control
over financial reporting.  

Cautionary
Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information for the Purpose of  Safe Harbor  Provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995    

The
Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements with respect to long-term
goals or anticipated results of the Company, including statements contained in the Company s filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and in its reports to stockholders.  

Statements,
including those in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which are not historical or current facts, are  forward-looking statements 
made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There are certain important
factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made herein. Investors
are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty. Some of the factors that could affect results
are the cyclical nature of the furniture industry, supply chain disruptions, litigation, the effectiveness of new product introductions
and distribution channels, the product mix of sales, pricing pressures, the cost of raw materials and fuel, retention and recruitment
of key employees, actions by governments including laws, regulations, taxes and tariffs, inflation, the amount of sales generated
and the profit margins thereon, competition (both U.S. and foreign), credit exposure with customers, participation in multi-employer
pension plans and general economic conditions. For further information regarding these risks and uncertainties, see the  Risk
Factors  section in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

10   

The
Company specifically declines to undertake any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statements that have been made
to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated
events.
