NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of Cheniere have been prepared in accordance with   GAAP   for interim financial information and with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by   GAAP   for complete financial statements.  In our opinion, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation, have been included.  Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior period information to the current presentation.  The reclassifications had no effect on our overall consolidated financial position, operating results or cash flows. 
    
  Directly and through our subsidiary, Cheniere Partners, we are developing, constructing and operating liquefaction projects near Corpus Christi, Texas   (the  CCL Project )   and at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in Cameron Parish,  Louisiana   (the  SPL Project )  , respectively.  In 2016, we started production at the   SPL Project  .  As a result, we introduced a new line item entitled  cost of sales  and modified the components of activity included in  operating and maintenance expense  on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  To conform to the new presentation, reclassifications were made to the prior periods.  Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly for the production and delivery of LNG from the   SPL Project   such as natural gas feedstock, variable transportation and storage costs, derivative gains and losses associated with economic hedges to secure natural gas feedstock for the   SPL Project  , vessel chartering costs and other costs related to converting natural gas into LNG, all to the extent not utilized for the commissioning process.  These costs were reclassified from operating and maintenance expense.  Also included in cost of sales are purchase and delivery costs of our LNG and natural gas marketing business incurred by Cheniere Marketing.  Operating and maintenance expense now primarily includes costs associated with operating and maintaining the   SPL Project   such as third-party service and maintenance contract costs, payroll and benefit costs of operations personnel, natural gas transportation and storage capacity demand charges, derivative gains and losses related to the sale and purchase of LNG associated with the regasification terminal, insurance and regulatory costs.   
    
  Additionally, we distinguished and reclassified our historical  LNG terminal revenues  line item into  regasification revenues  and  LNG revenues.   Regasification revenues include LNG regasification capacity reservation fees that are received pursuant to our TUAs and tug services fees that are received by Sabine Pass Tug Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of SPLNG.  Substantially all of our regasification revenues, which are generated by our LNG terminal segment, are received from our   two   long-term TUA customers.  LNG revenues include fees that are received pursuant to our SPAs and related LNG marketing activities.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we received   44%   and   50%  , respectively, of our net LNG revenues from   one   SPA customer, which were generated by our LNG terminal segment. 
    
  Results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that will be realized for the year ending December 31,   2016  . 
    
  For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

NOTE 2 RESTRICTED CASH 
    
  Restricted cash consists of funds that are contractually restricted as to usage or withdrawal and have been presented separately from cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands):  

Under the indentures governing the senior notes issued by SPLNG   (the  SPLNG Indentures )  , except for permitted tax distributions, SPLNG may not make distributions until certain conditions are satisfied, including: (1) there must be on deposit in an interest payment account an amount equal to   one  -sixth of the semi-annual interest payment multiplied by the number of elapsed months since the last semi-annual interest payment, and (2) there must be on deposit in a permanent debt service reserve fund an amount equal to   one   semi-annual interest payment.  Distributions are permitted only after satisfying the foregoing funding requirements, a fixed charge coverage ratio test of   2  :1 and other conditions specified in the   SPLNG Indentures  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , SPLNG made distributions of   $230.4 million   and   $267.9 million  , respectively, after satisfying all the applicable conditions in the   SPLNG Indentures  . 
    
  In February 2016, Cheniere Partners entered into a   $2.8 billion   credit facility   (the  2016 CQP Credit Facilities )  .  Cheniere Partners, and Cheniere Investments and CTPL as Cheniere Partners  guarantor subsidiaries, are subject to limitations on the use of cash under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   and the related depositary agreement governing the extension of credit to Cheniere Partners.  Specifically, Cheniere Partners, Cheniere Investments and CTPL may only withdraw funds from collateral accounts held at a designated depositary bank on a monthly basis and for specific purposes, including for the payment of operating expenses.  In addition, distributions and capital expenditures may only be made quarterly and are subject to certain restrictions. 

NOTE 3 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , accounts and other receivables consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Pursuant to the accounts agreement entered into with the collateral trustee for the benefit of SPL s debt holders, SPL is required to deposit all cash received into reserve accounts controlled by the collateral trustee.  The usage or withdrawal of such cash is restricted to the payment of liabilities related to the   SPL Project   and other restricted payments.

NOTE 4 INVENTORY 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): 

NOTE 5 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
    
  Property, plant and equipment consists of LNG terminal costs and fixed assets and other, as follows (in thousands): 

During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we realized offsets to LNG terminal costs of   $68.3 million   and   $214.3 million  , respectively, that were related to the sale of commissioning cargoes because these amounts were earned prior to the start of commercial operations, during the testing phase for the construction of Trains 1 and 2 of the   SPL Project  . 

NOTE 6 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  
    
  We have entered into the following derivative instruments that are reported at fair value: 
             
    interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to volatility in a portion of the floating-rate interest payments under certain of our credit facilities   ( Interest Rate Derivatives )  ; 
                
    commodity derivatives to hedge the exposure to price risk attributable to future: (1) sales of our LNG inventory and (2) purchases of natural gas to operate the Sabine Pass LNG terminal   ( Natural Gas Derivatives )  ; 
                
    commodity derivatives consisting of natural gas supply contracts for the commissioning and operation of the   SPL Project     ( Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives )   and associated economic hedges   ( Financial Liquefaction Supply Derivatives , and collectively with the Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives, the  Liquefaction Supply Derivatives )  ; 
                
    financial derivatives to hedge the exposure to the commodity markets in which we have contractual arrangements to purchase or sell physical LNG   ( LNG Trading Derivatives )  ; and 
                
    foreign currency exchange ( FX ) contracts to hedge exposure to currency risk associated with operations in countries outside of the United States   ( FX Derivatives )  .

CHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
  (unaudited) 

None of our derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedging instruments, and changes in fair value are recorded within our Consolidated   Statements of Operations  . 
    
  The following table (in thousands) shows the fair value of our derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which are classified as   other current assets  ,   non-current derivative assets  ,   derivative liabilities   or non-current derivative liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

We value our   Interest Rate Derivatives   using valuations based on the initial trade prices.  Using an income-based approach, subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model including interest rate curves, risk adjusted discount rates, credit spreads and other relevant data.  The estimated fair values of our economic hedges related to the   LNG Trading Derivatives   and our   Natural Gas Derivatives   are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged currently between willing parties.  We value these derivatives using observable commodity price curves and other relevant data.  We estimate the fair values of our   FX Derivatives   with a market approach using observable FX rates and other relevant data. 
    
  We acquired   $0.8 million   of certain LNG Trading Derivatives during the first quarter of 2016, which we transferred into Level 1 during the second quarter of 2016.  We transferred these   LNG Trading Derivatives   to Level 1 due to the use of unadjusted quoted exchange prices to calculate the fair value of these LNG Trading derivative positions, which were previously Level 2 as the fair value was calculated using adjusted quoted exchange prices.  There were   no   transfers in and out of Level 2 during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The fair value of substantially all of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   is developed through the use of internal models which are impacted by inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace.  As a result, the fair value of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.  The curves used to generate the fair value of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   are based on basis adjustments applied to forward curves for a liquid trading point.  In addition, there may be observable liquid market basis information in the near term, but terms of a particular   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   contract may exceed the period for which such information is available, resulting in a Level 3 classification.  In these instances, the fair value of the contract incorporates extrapolation assumptions made in the determination of the market basis price for future delivery periods in which applicable commodity basis prices were either not observable or lacked corroborative market data.  Internal fair value models include conditions precedent to the respective long-term natural gas supply contracts.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , some of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   existed within markets for which the pipeline infrastructure is under development to accommodate marketable physical gas flow.  Accordingly, our internal fair value models are based on market prices that equate to our own contractual pricing due to: (1) the inactive and unobservable market and (2) conditions precedent and their impact on the uncertainty in the timing of our actual receipt of the physical volumes associated with each forward.  The fair value of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   is predominantly driven by market commodity basis prices and our assessment of the associated conditions precedent, including evaluating whether the respective market is available as pipeline infrastructure is developed.  Upon the completion and placement into service of relevant pipeline

infrastructure to accommodate marketable physical gas flow, we recognize a gain or loss based on the fair value of the respective natural gas supply contracts as of the reporting date.  
    
  As all of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   are either purely index-priced or index-priced with a fixed basis, we do not believe that a significant change in market commodity prices would have a material impact on our Level 3 fair value measurements.  The following table includes quantitative information for the unobservable inputs for our Level 3   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   as of   September 30, 2016  :

    Transferred to Level 2 as a result of observable market for the underlying natural gas supply contracts.  
     Derivative assets and liabilities arising from our derivative contracts with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis, as all counterparty derivative contracts provide for net settlement.  The use of derivative instruments exposes us to counterparty credit risk, or the risk that a counterparty will be unable to meet its commitments in instances when our derivative instruments are in an asset position.      
    
  Interest Rate Derivatives 
    
  SPL Interest Rate Derivatives    
    
  SPL has entered into interest rate swaps   ( SPL Interest Rate Derivatives )   to protect against volatility of future cash flows and hedge a portion of the variable interest payments on the credit facilities it entered into in June 2015   (the  2015 SPL Credit Facilities )  .  The   SPL Interest Rate Derivatives   hedge a portion of the expected outstanding borrowings over the term of the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  . 
    
  In March 2015, SPL settled a portion of the SPL Interest Rate Derivatives and recognized a derivative loss of   $34.7 million   within our Consolidated   Statements of Operations   in conjunction with the termination of approximately   $1.8 billion   of commitments under the previous credit facilities. 
    
  CQP Interest Rate Derivatives    
    
  In March 2016, Cheniere Partners entered into interest rate swaps   ( CQP Interest Rate Derivatives )   to protect against volatility of future cash flows and hedge a portion of the variable interest payments on the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  .  The   CQP Interest Rate Derivatives   hedge a portion of the expected outstanding borrowings over the term of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  .

  CCH has entered into interest rate swaps   ( CCH Interest Rate Derivatives )   to protect against volatility of future cash flows and hedge a portion of the variable interest payments on its credit facility   (the  2015 CCH Credit Facility )  .  The   CCH Interest Rate Derivatives   hedge a portion of the expected outstanding borrowings over the term of the   2015 CCH Credit Facility  .  The   CCH Interest Rate Derivatives   have a   seven  -year term and were contingent upon reaching a final investment decision with respect to the   CCL Project  , which was reached in May 2015.  Upon meeting the contingency related to the   CCH Interest Rate Derivatives   in May 2015, we paid   $50.1 million   related to contingency and syndication premiums, which is included in derivative gain (loss), net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the following Interest Rate Derivatives outstanding:

  SPL has entered into index-based physical natural gas supply contracts and associated economic hedges to purchase natural gas for the commissioning and operation of the   SPL Project  .  The terms of the physical natural gas supply contracts primarily range from approximately   one   to   seven   years and commence upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including but not limited to the date of first commercial operation of specified Trains of the   SPL Project  .  We recognize our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   are reported in earnings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , SPL has secured up to approximately

1,982.0 million     MMBtu   of natural gas feedstock through natural gas supply contracts.  The notional natural gas position of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   was approximately   1,069.0 million     MMBtu   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Our   Financial Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   are executed through over-the-counter contracts which are subject to nominal credit risk as these transactions are settled on a daily margin basis with investment grade financial institutions.  We are required by these financial institutions to use margin deposits as credit support for our   Financial Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   activities. 
    
  LNG Trading Derivatives    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have entered into certain   LNG Trading Derivatives   representing a short position of   12.6 million   MMBtu, and we may from time to time enter into certain financial derivatives in the form of swaps, forwards, options or futures to economically hedge exposure to the commodity markets in which we have contractual arrangements to purchase or sell physical LNG.  We have entered into   LNG Trading Derivatives   to secure a fixed price position to minimize future cash flow variability associated with such LNG transactions. 
    
  Natural Gas Derivatives    
    
  Our   Natural Gas Derivatives   were executed through over-the-counter contracts which were subject to nominal credit risk as these transactions settled on a daily margin basis with investment grade financial institutions.  We were required by these financial institutions to use margin deposits as credit support for our   Natural Gas Derivatives   activities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did   no  t have any open   Natural Gas Derivatives   positions or margin deposits at financial institutions. 
    
  We recognize all commodity derivative instruments, including our   Liquefaction Supply Derivatives  ,   LNG Trading Derivatives   and   Natural Gas Derivatives     (collectively,  Commodity Derivatives )  , as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of our   Commodity Derivatives   are reported in earnings.

  FX Derivatives    
    
  Cheniere Marketing has entered into   FX Derivatives   to protect against the volatility in future cash flows attributable to changes in international currency exchange rates.  The   FX Derivatives   economically hedge the foreign currency exposure arising from cash flows expended for both physical and financial LNG transactions and general and administrative expenses related to operations in countries outside of the United States.  The total notional amount of our   FX Derivatives   was   $14.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .

NOTE 7 OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , other non-current assets consisted of the following (in thousands): 

NOTE 8 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY 
    
  Cheniere Holdings 
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  .  This guidance changed (1) the identification of variable interests, (2) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination.   
    
  Cheniere Holdings is a limited liability company formed by us in 2013 to hold our Cheniere Partners limited partner interests.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   80.1%   of Cheniere Holdings as well as the director voting share.  The director voting share is the sole share entitled to vote in the election of Cheniere Holdings  board of directors and allows us to remove members of the board of directors at any time and for any reason.  If we cease to own greater than   25%   of the common shares of Cheniere Holdings or if we choose to relinquish the director voting share, the director voting share will be extinguished.  
    
  The board of directors makes all major operating and financial decisions on behalf of Cheniere Holdings.  Because ownership of the director voting share allows us to control Cheniere Holdings, irrespective of our majority ownership interest, and the director voting share cannot be removed from our control by the other equity holders of Cheniere Holdings, we have determined that  
  
   15 

CHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
  (unaudited) 

Cheniere Holdings is now a variable interest entity.  However, this determination has not changed the consolidation of Cheniere Holdings as we have determined that we are its primary beneficiary.  Therefore, the determination that Cheniere Holdings is now a variable interest entity had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.   

NOTE 9 NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST 
    
  As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we owned   80.1%   of Cheniere Holdings as well as the director voting share, with the remaining non-controlling interest held by the public.  Cheniere Holdings owns a   55.9%   limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners in the form of   12.0 million   common units,   45.3 million   Class B units and   135.4 million   subordinated units, with the remaining non-controlling interest held by Blackstone CQP Holdco LP and the public.  We also own   100%   of the general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights in Cheniere Partners.    

NOTE 10 ACCRUED LIABILITIES

(1) 
    Must be redeemed or repaid concurrently with the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   if the obligations under the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   are satisfied with borrowings under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  .  See    Note 20 Subsequent Events    for additional details about the redemption of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  . 
              (2) 
    Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, which require debt issuance costs related to term notes to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, rather than as an asset, retrospectively

  SPL Senior Notes  
    
  In June and September 2016, SPL issued the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  , respectively, for aggregate principal amounts of   $1.5 billion   each.  Net proceeds of the offerings of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and   2027 SPL Senior Notes   were approximately   $1.3 billion   and   $1.4 billion  , respectively, after deducting commissions, fees and expenses and incremental interest required under the respective senior notes during construction.  The net proceeds were used to prepay a portion (for the   2026 SPL Senior Notes  ) or all (for the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  ) of the outstanding borrowings and terminate commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  , resulting in a write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   of   $25.8 million   and   $51.8 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The remaining proceeds from the   2027 SPL Senior Notes   are being used to pay a portion of the capital costs in connection with the construction of Trains 1 through 5 of the   SPL Project   in lieu of the terminated portion of the commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  .  The   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and   2027 SPL Senior Notes   accrue interest at fixed rates of   5.875%   and   5.00%  , respectively, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears.  The terms of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and   2027 SPL Senior Notes   are governed by the same common indenture as the other senior notes of SPL, which contains customary terms and events of default, covenants and redemption terms. 
    
  In connection with the issuance of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  , SPL entered into registration rights agreements   (the  SPL Registration Rights Agreements )  .  Under the terms of the   SPL Registration Rights Agreements  , SPL has agreed, and any future guarantors will agree, to use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC and cause to become effective registration statements relating to offers to exchange any and all of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and   2027 SPL Senior Notes   for like aggregate principal amounts of debt securities of SPL with terms identical in all material respects to the respective senior notes sought to be exchanged (other than with respect to restrictions on transfer or to any increase in annual interest rate), within   360 days   after June 14, 2016 and September 23, 2016, respectively.  Under specified circumstances, SPL has also agreed, and any future guarantors will also agree, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective shelf registration statements relating to resales of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  .  SPL will be obligated to pay additional interest on these senior notes if it fails to comply with its obligation to register them within the specified time period. 
    
  2024 CCH Senior Notes    
    
  In May 2016, CCH issued an aggregate principal amount of   $1.25 billion   of the   2024 CCH Senior Notes  , which are jointly and severally guaranteed by its subsidiaries, CCL, CCP and Corpus Christi Pipeline GP, LLC ( CCP GP , and collectively with CCL and CCP, the  Guarantors ).  Net proceeds of the offering of approximately   $1.1 billion  , after deducting commissions, fees and expenses and incremental interest required under the   2024 CCH Senior Notes   during construction, were used to prepay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the   2015 CCH Credit Facility  , resulting in a write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the   2015 CCH Credit Facility   of   $29.0 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Borrowings under the   2024 CCH Senior Notes   accrue interest at a fixed rate of   7.000%  , and interest on the   2024 CCH Senior Notes   is payable semi-annually in arrears. 
    
  The indenture governing the   2024 CCH Senior Notes     (the  CCH Indenture )   contains customary terms and events of default and certain covenants that, among other things, limit CCH s ability and the ability of CCH s restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions on membership interests or subordinated indebtedness or purchase, redeem or retire membership interests; sell or transfer assets, including membership or partnership interests of CCH s restricted subsidiaries; restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries to CCH or any of CCH s restricted subsidiaries; incur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; dissolve, liquidate, consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of the properties or assets of CCH and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole; or permit any Guarantor to dissolve, liquidate, consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets.

Under specified circumstances, CCH and the Guarantors have also agreed, and any future guarantors of the   2024 CCH Senior Notes   will also agree, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective a shelf registration statement relating to resales of the   2024 CCH Senior Notes  .

  2016 CQP Credit Facilities 
    
  In February 2016, Cheniere Partners entered into the   $2.8 billion     2016 CQP Credit Facilities  , which consist of: (1) a   $450.0 million   CTPL tranche term loan that was used to prepay the   $400.0 million     CTPL Term Loan   in February 2016, (2) an approximately   $2.1 billion   SPLNG tranche term loan that will be used to redeem or repay the approximately   $2.1 billion   of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   and the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   (which must be redeemed or repaid concurrently under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  ), (3) a   $125.0 million   debt service reserve credit facility   (the  DSR Facility )   that may be used to satisfy a   six  -month debt service reserve requirement and (4) a   $115.0 million   revolving credit facility that may be used for general business purposes.  
    
  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   accrue interest at a variable rate per annum equal to   LIBOR or the base rate   (equal to the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus   0.50%   and adjusted one month LIBOR plus   1.0%  ), plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margin for LIBOR loans is   2.25%   per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans is   1.25%   per annum, in each case with a   0.50%   step-up beginning on February 25, 2019.  Interest on LIBOR loans is due and payable at the end of each applicable LIBOR period (and at the end of every three month period within the LIBOR period, if any), and interest on base rate loans is due and payable at the end of each calendar quarter.  
    
  Cheniere Partners incurred   $48.7 million   of debt issuance costs as of   September 30, 2016  , and will incur an additional   $21.5 million   of debt issuance costs when the SPLNG tranche is funded.  The prepayment of the   CTPL Term Loan   resulted in a write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of   $1.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  Cheniere Partners pays a commitment fee equal to an annual rate of   40%   of the margin for LIBOR loans multiplied by the average daily amount of the undrawn commitment, payable quarterly in arrears.  The   DSR Facility   and the revolving credit facility are both available for the issuance of letters of credit, which incur a fee equal to an annual rate of   2.25%   of the undrawn portion with a   0.50%   step-up beginning on February 25, 2019.   
    
  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   mature on February 25, 2020, and the outstanding balance may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, except for interest hedging and interest rate breakage costs.  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   contain conditions precedent for extensions of credit, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and limit Cheniere Partners  ability to make restricted payments, including distributions, to once per fiscal quarter as long as certain conditions are satisfied.  Under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  , Cheniere Partners is required to hedge not less than   50%   of the variable interest rate exposure on its projected aggregate outstanding balance, maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of at least   1.15  x at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning March 31, 2019 and have a projected debt service coverage ratio of   1.55  x in order to incur additional indebtedness to refinance a portion of the existing obligations.

SPL Senior Notes  ;   2027 SPL Senior Notes  ; and   2024 CCH Senior Notes     (collectively, the  Senior Notes )  .  The Level 2 estimated fair value was based on quotes obtained from broker-dealers or market makers of the   Senior Notes   and other similar instruments. 
           (2) 
    The Level 3 estimated fair value approximates the principal amount because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates and the debt may be repaid, in full or in part, at any time without penalty.  
              (3) 
    Includes   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  ,   SPL Working Capital Facility  ,   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  ,   2015 CCH Credit Facility   and   Cheniere Marketing trade finance facilities  . 
              (4) 
    The Level 3 estimated fair value was calculated based on inputs that are observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, including our stock price and interest rates based on debt issued by parties with comparable credit ratings to us and inputs that are not observable in the market.  
              (5) 
    The Level 1 estimated fair value was based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities that we had the ability to access at the measurement date.  

NOTE 12 RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE 
     
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated certain organizational changes to simplify our corporate structure, improve our operational efficiencies and implement a strategy for sustainable, long-term stockholder value creation through financially disciplined development, construction, operation and investment.  As a result of these efforts, we recorded   $26.2 million   and   $49.2 million   of restructuring charges and other costs associated with restructuring and operational efficiency initiatives during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, for which the majority of these charges required, or will require, cash expenditure.  Included in these amounts are   $20.9 million   and   $42.9 million   for share-based compensation during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  All charges were recorded within the line item entitled  restructuring expense  on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and substantially all related to severance and other employee-related costs.

Operational efficiency initiatives remain ongoing and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2016. 

NOTE 13 INCOME TAXES 
     
  We are not presently a taxpayer for federal or state income tax purposes and have not recorded a provision for federal or state income taxes in any of the periods included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  We have recorded a net benefit (provision) of   $(1.6) million   and   $0.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   $(1.9) million   and   $(0.1) million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, for foreign income taxes.

An analysis of the annual limitation on the utilization of our net operating losses   ( NOLs )   was performed in accordance with   IRC   Section 382.  It was determined that   IRC   Section 382 will not limit the use of our   NOLs   in full over the carryover period.  We will continue to monitor trading activity in our shares which may cause an additional ownership change which could ultimately affect our ability to fully utilize our existing   NOL   carryforwards.

26.6 million   shares, net of cancellations, have been granted under the   2011 Plan  .  The   2015 Plan   generally provides for cash-settled awards in the form of stock appreciation rights, phantom unit awards, performance unit awards, other-stock based awards and cash awards.

See    Note 20 Subsequent Events    regarding the termination of 2014-2018 Long-Term Cash Incentive Program ( 2014-2018 LTIP ) under the   2015 Plan  .  The   Inducement Plan   provides for the issuance of up to   1.0 million   shares of our common stock in the form of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, phantom stock awards and other stock-based awards deemed by the   Compensation Committee   to provide us with an opportunity to attract employees.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   0.2 million   shares of restricted stock have been granted under the   Inducement Plan  .   
    
  Total share-based compensation expense consisted of the following (in thousands): 

The total unrecognized compensation cost at   September 30, 2016   relating to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements was   $138.0 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.4 years  . 
    
  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $4.3 million   and   $5.6 million  , respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to the modification of share-based compensation awards resulting from employee terminations. 
    
  We received   $0.1 million   in each of the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $0.4 million   and   $2.3 million   in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 

NOTE 15 NET LOSS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS 
    
  Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders   ( EPS )   excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted   EPS   reflects potential dilution and is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued. 
    
  The following table (in thousands, except for loss per share) reconciles basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

(1) 
    Stock options and unvested stock of   5.8 million   shares and   5.7 million   shares for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   8.6 million   shares for each of the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , representing securities that could potentially dilute basic   EPS   in the future, were not included in the diluted net loss per share computations because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  Included in these numbers of shares are   5.1 million   shares for each of the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   5.4 million   shares for each of the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   of unvested stock that have performance conditions not yet satisfied as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  In addition,   16.2 million   shares in aggregate for the   three and nine months

ended September 30, 2016   and   15.6 million   shares in aggregate for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , issuable upon conversion of the   2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes   and the   2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes  , were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because the computation of diluted net loss per share utilizing the  if-converted  method would be anti-dilutive.  There were   no   shares included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for the   2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes   because substantive non-market-based contingencies underlying the eligible conversion date have not been met as of   September 30, 2016  . 

NOTE 16 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
    
  Cheniere has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executed contracts which do not meet the definition of a liability as of   September 30, 2016  , are not recognized as liabilities. 
    
  Parallax Litigation  
    
  In 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary, Cheniere LNG Terminals, LLC ( CLNGT ), entered into discussions with Parallax Enterprises, LLC ( Parallax Enterprises ) regarding the potential joint development of two liquefaction plants in Louisiana (the  Potential Liquefaction Transactions ).  While the parties negotiated regarding the Potential Liquefaction Transactions, CLNGT loaned Parallax Enterprises approximately   $46 million  , as reflected in a secured note dated April 23, 2015, as amended on June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and November 4, 2015 (the  Secured Note ).  The Secured Note was secured by all assets of Parallax Enterprises and its subsidiary entities.  On June 30, 2015, Parallax Enterprises  parent entity, Parallax Energy LLC ( Parallax Energy ), executed a Pledge and Guarantee Agreement further securing repayment of the Secured Note by providing a parent guaranty and a pledge of all of the equity of Parallax Enterprises in satisfaction of the Secured Note (the  Pledge Agreement ).  CLNGT and Parallax Enterprises never executed a definitive agreement to pursue the Potential Liquefaction Transactions.  The Secured Note matured on December 11, 2015, and Parallax Enterprises failed to make payment.  On February 3, 2016, CLNGT filed an action against Parallax Energy, Parallax Enterprises, and certain of Parallax Enterprises  subsidiary entities, styled Cause No. 4:16-cv-00286, Cheniere LNG Terminals, LLC v. Parallax Energy LLC, et al., in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (the  Texas Suit ).  CLNGT asserted claims in the Texas Suit for (1) recovery of all amounts due under the Secured Note and (2) declaratory relief establishing that CLNGT is entitled to enforce its rights under the Secured Note and Pledge Agreement in accordance with each instrument s terms and that CLNGT has no obligations of any sort to Parallax Enterprises concerning the Potential Liquefaction Transactions.  On March 11, 2016, Parallax Enterprises and the other defendants in the Texas Suit moved to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  On August 2, 2016, the court denied the defendants  motion to dismiss without prejudice and permitted the parties to pursue jurisdictional discovery, which is ongoing.  
    
  On March 11, 2016, Parallax Enterprises filed a suit against us and CLNGT styled Civil Action No. 62-810, Parallax Enterprises LLP v. Cheniere Energy, Inc. and Cheniere LNG Terminals, LLC, in the 25th Judicial District Court of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana (the  Louisiana Suit ), wherein Parallax Enterprises asserted claims for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation, detrimental reliance, unjust enrichment and violation of the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act.  Parallax Enterprises predicated its claims in the Louisiana Suit on an allegation that we and CLNGT breached a purported agreement to jointly develop the Potential Liquefaction Transactions.  Parallax Enterprises sought   $400 million   in alleged economic damages and rescission of the Secured Note.  On April 15, 2016, we and CLNGT removed the Louisiana Suit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, which subsequently transferred the Louisiana Suit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, where it was assigned Civil Action No. 4:16-cv-01628 and transferred to the same judge presiding over the Texas Suit for coordinated handling.  On August 22, 2016, Parallax Enterprises voluntarily dismissed all claims asserted against CLNGT and us in the Louisiana Suit without prejudice to refiling.  We do not expect that the resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse impact on our financial results. 
    
  Obligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts 
    
  Cheniere and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions with third parties.  These arrangements include financial guarantees, letters of credit and debt guarantees.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   liabilities recognized under these guarantee arrangements.

The forward-looking statements contained in this   quarterly   report are largely based on our expectations, which reflect estimates and assumptions made by our management.  These estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions and other factors.  Although we believe that such estimates are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control.  In addition, assumptions may prove to be inaccurate.  We caution that the forward-looking statements contained in this   quarterly   report are not guarantees of future performance and that such statements may not be realized or the forward-looking statements or events may not occur.  Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated or implied in forward-looking statements due to factors described in this   quarterly   report and in the other reports and other information that we file with the SEC.

  Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those discussed under  Risk Factors  in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31,

Overview of Business 
    
  Cheniere, a Delaware corporation, is a Houston-based energy company primarily engaged in LNG-related businesses.  Our vision is to be recognized as the premier global LNG company and provide a reliable, competitive and integrated source of LNG to our customers while creating a safe, productive and rewarding work environment for our employees.  We own and operate the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana through our ownership interest in and management agreements with Cheniere Partners, which is a publicly traded limited partnership that we created in 2007.  We own   100%   of the general partner interest in Cheniere Partners and   80.1%   of Cheniere Holdings, which is a publicly traded limited liability company formed in 2013 that owns a   55.9%   limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners.  We are currently developing and constructing two natural gas liquefaction and export facilities.   
    
  The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, on the Sabine-Neches Waterway less than four miles from the Gulf Coast.  The Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification facilities owned by Cheniere Partners  wholly owned subsidiary, SPLNG, that include existing infrastructure of five LNG storage tanks with capacity of approximately 16.9   Bcfe  , two marine berths that can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4.0   Bcf/d  .  Cheniere Partners is developing and constructing natural gas liquefaction facilities   (the  SPL Project )   at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities through a wholly owned subsidiary, SPL.  Cheniere Partners plans to construct up to six Trains, which are in various stages of development and construction.  Trains 1 and 2 have commenced operating activities, Train 3 is undergoing commissioning, Trains 4 and 5 are under construction and Train 6 is fully permitted.  Each Train is expected to have a nominal production capacity of approximately 4.5   mtpa   of LNG.  Cheniere Partners also owns a 94-mile pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines   (the  Creole Trail Pipeline )   through a wholly owned subsidiary, CTPL.   
    
  We are developing and constructing a second natural gas liquefaction and export facility at the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, which is on nearly   2,000   acres of land that we own or control near Corpus Christi, Texas, and a pipeline facility   (collectively, the  CCL Project )   through wholly owned subsidiaries CCL and CCP, respectively.  The   CCL Project   is being developed for up to three Trains, with expected aggregate nominal production capacity of approximately 13.5   mtpa   of LNG, three LNG storage tanks with capacity of approximately 10.1   Bcfe   and two marine berths that can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters.  The   CCL Project   is being developed in stages.  The first stage   ( Stage 1 )   includes Trains 1 and 2, two LNG storage tanks, one complete marine berth and a second partial berth and all of the   CCL Project   s necessary infrastructure facilities.  The second stage   ( Stage 2 )   includes Train 3, one LNG storage tank and the completion of the second partial berth.  The   CCL Project   also includes a 23-mile, 48-inch natural gas supply pipeline that will interconnect the Corpus Christi LNG terminal with several interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines   (the  Corpus Christi Pipeline )  .   

31 

Corpus Christi Liquefaction Stage III, LLC and Cheniere Corpus Christi Pipeline Stage III, LLC (the  CCL Stage III entities ), our wholly owned subsidiaries separate from the CCH Group, are also developing two additional Trains and one LNG storage tank at the Corpus Christi LNG terminal adjacent to the   CCL Project  , along with a second natural gas pipeline.  
    
  Cheniere Marketing is engaged in the LNG and natural gas marketing business and is developing a portfolio of long-term, short-term and spot   SPA  s.  Cheniere Marketing has entered into   SPA  s with SPL and CCL to purchase, at Cheniere Marketing s option, LNG produced by the   SPL Project   and the   CCL Project  . 
    
  We are also in various stages of developing other projects which, among other things, will require acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make a final investment decision   ( FID )  .  We have proposed the development of a pipeline with expected capacity of up to 1.4   Bcf/d   connecting new gas production in the Anadarko Basin to Gulf Coast markets, including markets serving the   SPL Project   and the   CCL Project  .  We expect the regulatory pre-filing process to commence imminently and to file formal applications for the required regulatory permits in 2017.  We are also exploring the development of a midscale liquefaction project using electric drive modular Trains, with an expected aggregate nominal production capacity of approximately 9.5 mtpa of LNG.  

Overview of Significant Events  
    
  Our significant accomplishments since January 1,   2016   and through the filing date of this Form 10-Q include the following:   
             
    SPL commenced production and shipment of LNG commissioning cargoes from Trains 1 and 2 of the   SPL Project   in February and August 2016, respectively, and achieved substantial completion and commenced operating activities in May and September 2016, respectively. 
                
    In September 2016, SPL initiated the commissioning process for Train 3 of the   SPL Project  . 
                
    In October 2016, the previously announced planned outage to improve performance of the flare systems at the   SPL Project  , as well as to perform scheduled maintenance to Train 1 and other facilities, was completed on schedule and budget. 
                
    In May 2016, our Board of Directors appointed Jack Fusco as our President and Chief Executive Officer. 
                
    In February 2016, Cheniere Partners entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement for the incurrence of debt of up to an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 billion   (the  2016 CQP Credit Facilities )  .  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   consist of: (1) a   $450.0 million   CTPL tranche term loan that was used to prepay the   $400.0 million   term loan facility   (the  CTPL Term Loan )   in February 2016, (2) an approximately   $2.1 billion   SPLNG tranche term loan that will be used to redeem or repay the approximately   $2.1 billion   of the 7.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 issued by SPLNG   (the  2016 SPLNG Senior Notes )   and the 6.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 issued by SPLNG   (the  2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  and collectively with the 2016 SPLNG Senior Notes, the  SPLNG Senior Notes )   (which must be redeemed or repaid concurrently under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   ), (3) a   $125.0 million   debt service reserve credit facility   (the  DSR Facility )   that may be used to satisfy a   six  -month debt service reserve requirement and (4) a   $115.0 million   revolving credit facility that may be used for general business purposes. 
                
    In May 2016, CCH issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion of 7.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2024   (the  2024 CCH Senior Notes )  .  Net proceeds of the offering of approximately $1.1 billion, after deducting commissions, fees and expenses and incremental interest required under the   2024 CCH Senior Notes   during construction, were used to prepay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its credit facility   (the  2015 CCH Credit Facility )  .  
                
    In June and September 2016, SPL issued 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2026   (the  2026 SPL Senior Notes )   and 5.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2027   (the  2027 SPL Senior Notes )  , respectively, for aggregate principal amounts of   $1.5 billion   each.  Net proceeds of the offerings of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and   2027 SPL Senior Notes   were approximately   $1.3 billion   and   $1.4 billion  , respectively, after deducting commissions, fees and expenses and incremental interest required under the respective senior notes during construction.  The net proceeds were used to prepay a portion (for the   2026 SPL Senior Notes  ) or all (for the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  ) of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities we entered into in June 2015   (the  2015 SPL Credit Facilities )  .  The remaining proceeds from the   2027 SPL Senior Notes   are being used to pay a portion of the capital costs in connection with the construction of Trains 1 through 5 of the   SPL Project   in lieu of the terminated portion of the commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  . 
                
    On September 30, 2016, we submitted a proposal to Cheniere Holdings  board of directors to acquire the publicly held shares of Cheniere Holdings not already owned by us in a stock for stock exchange.  There can be no assurance that any discussions that may occur between us and Cheniere Holdings in connection with our proposal will result in the entry  
     
   32 

into a definitive agreement concerning a transaction or, if such a definitive agreement is reached, will result in the consummation of a transaction provided for in such definitive agreement. 
             
    In October 2016, SPLNG issued a notice of redemption to redeem all of its outstanding   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  .  The redemption date will be November 30, 2016 (the  Redemption Date ) and the price will be equal to 103.250% of the principal amount of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   to, but not including, the Redemption Date.  Concurrently with the redemption of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  , SPLNG intends to repay all of its outstanding   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  , which mature on the Redemption Date, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   to, but not including, the Redemption Date. 
      
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Although results are consolidated for financial reporting, Cheniere, Cheniere Holdings, Cheniere Partners, SPL, SPLNG and the CCH Group operate with independent capital structures.  We expect the cash needs for at least the next twelve months will be met for each of these independent capital structures as follows:   
     SPLNG through operating cash flows, existing unrestricted cash and debt offerings or equity contributions; 
     SPL through project debt and borrowings, equity contributions from Cheniere Partners and operating cash flows; 
             
    Cheniere Partners through operating cash flows from SPLNG, SPL and CTPL, existing unrestricted cash and debt or equity offerings; 
        Cheniere Holdings through distributions from Cheniere Partners;  
     CCH Group through project financing and equity contributions from Cheniere; and 
             
    Cheniere through project financing, existing unrestricted cash, debt and equity offerings by us or our subsidiaries, operating cash flows, services fees from Cheniere Holdings, Cheniere Partners and its other subsidiaries and distributions from our investments in Cheniere Holdings and Cheniere Partners.  
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $990.1 million   available to Cheniere.  In addition, we had current and non-current restricted cash of   $858.7 million   (which included current and non-current restricted cash available to us and our subsidiaries) designated for the following purposes:   $192.8 million   for the   CCL Project  ;   $325.6 million   for the   SPL Project  ;   $127.5 million   due to restrictions under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  ;   $129.1 million   for interest payments related to the   SPLNG Senior Notes  ; and   $83.7 million   for other restricted purposes.    
    
  In November 2014, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion Convertible Unsecured Notes due 2021   (the  2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes )  .  The   2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes   are convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at the then applicable conversion rate, provided that the closing price of our common stock is greater than or equal to the conversion price on the date of conversion.  The initial conversion price was $93.64 and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events.  We have the option to satisfy the conversion obligation with cash, common stock or a combination thereof. 
    
  In March 2015, we issued the $625.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2045   (the  2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes )  .  We have the right, at our option, at any time after March 15, 2020, to redeem all or any part of the   2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes   at a redemption price equal to the accreted amount of the   2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes   to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to such redemption date.  The conversion rate will initially equal 7.2265 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the   2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes  , which corresponds to an initial conversion price of approximately $138.38 per share of our common stock.  The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events.  We have the option to satisfy the conversion obligation with cash, common stock or a combination thereof. 
  
   33 

Cheniere Holdings 
    
  Cheniere Holdings was formed by us to hold our Cheniere Partners limited partner interests, thereby allowing us to segregate our lower risk, stable, cash flow generating assets from our higher risk, early stage development projects and marketing activities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had an   80.1%   direct ownership interest in Cheniere Holdings.  We receive dividends on our Cheniere Holdings shares from the distributions that Cheniere Holdings receives from Cheniere Partners, and we receive management fees for managing Cheniere Holdings.  We received   $11.1 million   and $11.0 million in dividends on our Cheniere Holdings common shares during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and $0.8 million of management fees from Cheniere Holdings during each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  
    
  Cheniere Partners 
    
  Our ownership interest in the Sabine Pass LNG terminal is held through Cheniere Partners.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we own   80.1%   of Cheniere Holdings, which owns a 55.9% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners in the form of   11,963,488   common units,   45,333,334   Class B units and   135,383,831   subordinated units.  We also own 100% of the general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights in Cheniere Partners.   
    
  Prior to the initial public offering by Cheniere Holdings, we received quarterly equity distributions from Cheniere Partners related to our limited partner and 2% general partner interests.  We will continue to receive quarterly equity distributions from Cheniere Partners related to our 2% general partner interest, and we receive fees for providing services to Cheniere Partners, SPLNG, SPL and CTPL.  We received $1.5 million in distributions on our general partner interest during each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , and we received   $100.1 million   and $66.4 million in total service fees from Cheniere Partners, SPLNG, SPL and CTPL, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.   
    
  Cheniere Partners  common unit and general partner distributions are being funded from accumulated operating surplus.  We have not received distributions on our subordinated units with respect to the quarters ended on or after June 30, 2010.  Cheniere Partners will not make distributions on our subordinated units until it generates additional cash flow from SPLNG, SPL, CTPL or other new business, which would be used to make quarterly distributions on our subordinated units before any increase in distributions to the common unitholders. 
    
  Cheniere Partners  Class B units are subject to conversion, mandatorily or at the option of the Class B unitholders under specified circumstances, into a number of common units based on the then-applicable conversion value of the Class B units.  The Cheniere Partners Class B units are not entitled to cash distributions except in the event of a liquidation of Cheniere Partners, a merger, consolidation or other combination of Cheniere Partners with another person or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Cheniere Partners.  On a quarterly basis beginning on the initial purchase date of the Class B units, the conversion value of the Class B units increases at a compounded rate of 3.5% per quarter, subject to an additional upward adjustment for certain equity and debt financings.  The accreted conversion ratio of the Class B units owned by Cheniere Holdings and Blackstone CQP Holdco LP (   Blackstone CQP Holdco   ) was   1.80   and   1.77  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  .  We expect the Class B units to mandatorily convert into common units within 90 days of the substantial completion date of Train 3 of the   SPL Project  , which Cheniere Partners currently expects to occur before June 30, 2017.  If the Class B units are not mandatorily converted by July 2019, the holders of the Class B units have the option to convert the Class B units into common units at that time.  The holders of   Class B units   have a preference over the holders of the subordinated units in the event of our liquidation or a merger, consolidation or other combination of us with another person or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.  
     
  The Class B units were issued at a discount to the market price of the Cheniere Partners common units into which they are convertible.  This discount, totaling $2,130.0 million, represents a beneficial conversion feature.  The beneficial conversion feature is similar to a dividend that will be distributed with respect to any Class B unit from its issuance date through its conversion date, resulting in an increase in Class B unitholders  equity and a decrease in common and subordinated unitholders  equity, including our equity interest in Cheniere Partners.  Cheniere Partners amortizes the beneficial conversion feature assuming a conversion date of August 2017, although actual conversion may occur prior to or after this assumed date.  Deemed dividends represented by the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature allocated to the Class B units held by   Blackstone CQP Holdco   are included in net loss attributable to non-controlling interest and result in a reduction of income available to common stockholders.  The impact to net loss attributable to non-controlling interest due to the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature was $6.8 million and $9.3 million during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The anticipated impact to net loss attributable to non-controlling interest due to the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature based on the assumed  
  
   34 

conversion date and ownership interest as of September 30, 2016, is approximately $33 million and $725 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017.  
    
  LNG Terminal Business 
    
  Sabine Pass LNG Terminal 
    
  Regasification Facilities 
    
  The Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification capacity of approximately 4.0   Bcf/d   and aggregate LNG storage capacity of approximately 16.9   Bcfe  .  Approximately 2.0   Bcf/d   of the regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal has been reserved under two long-term third-party   TUA  s, under which SPLNG s customers are required to pay fixed monthly fees, whether or not they use the LNG terminal.  Each of Total Gas   Power North America, Inc.   ( Total )   and Chevron U.S.A. Inc.   ( Chevron )   has reserved approximately 1.0   Bcf/d   of regasification capacity and is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $125 million annually for 20 years that commenced in 2009.  Total S.A. has guaranteed   Total   s obligations under its   TUA   up to $2.5 billion, subject to certain exceptions, and Chevron Corporation has guaranteed   Chevron   s obligations under its   TUA   up to 80% of the fees payable by   Chevron  .  
    
  The remaining approximately 2.0   Bcf/d   of capacity has been reserved under a   TUA   by SPL.  SPL is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $250 million annually, continuing until at least 20 years after SPL delivers its first commercial cargo at the   SPL Project  .  SPL entered into a partial TUA assignment agreement with   Total  , whereby SPL will progressively gain access to   Total   s capacity and other services provided under   Total   s TUA with SPLNG.  This agreement will provide SPL with additional berthing and storage capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal that may be used to accommodate the development of Trains 5 and 6, provide increased flexibility in managing LNG cargo loading and unloading activity starting with the commencement of commercial operations of Train 3 and permit SPL to more flexibly manage its LNG storage capacity with the commencement of Train 1.  Notwithstanding any arrangements between   Total   and SPL, payments required to be made by   Total   to SPLNG will continue to be made by   Total   to SPLNG in accordance with its TUA. 
    
  Under each of these   TUA  s, SPLNG is entitled to retain 2% of the LNG delivered to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.   
    
  Liquefaction Facilities 
    
  The   SPL Project   is being developed and constructed at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities.  We have received authorization from the FERC to site, construct and operate Trains 1 through 6.  We commenced construction of Trains 1 and 2 and the related new facilities needed to treat, liquefy, store and export natural gas in August 2012.  In May 2016 and September 2016, Trains 1 and 2 achieved substantial completion, respectively.  Construction of Trains 3 and 4 and the related facilities commenced in May 2013.  In June 2015, we commenced construction of Train 5 and the related facilities.  In October 2016, the previously announced planned outage to improve performance of the flare systems at the   SPL Project  , as well as to perform scheduled maintenance to Train 1 and other facilities, was completed on schedule and budget. 
    
  The   DOE   has authorized the export of domestically produced LNG by vessel from Trains 1 through 4 of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to   FTA countries   for a 30-year term, which commenced on May 15, 2016, and to   non-FTA countries   for a 20-year term, which commenced on June 3, 2016, in an amount up to a combined total of the equivalent of 16   mtpa   (approximately 803   Bcf/yr   of natural gas).  The   DOE   further issued orders authorizing SPL to export domestically produced LNG by vessel from Trains 1 through 4 of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to   FTA countries   for a 25-year term and non-FTA countries for a 20-year term, in an amount up to a combined total of the equivalent of approximately 203   Bcf/yr   of natural gas.  Additionally, the   DOE   issued orders authorizing us to export domestically produced LNG by vessel from Trains 5 and 6 of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to   FTA countries   and   non-FTA countries   for a 20-year term, in an amount up to a combined total of 503.3   Bcf/yr   of natural gas (approximately 10 mtpa).  A party to the proceedings requested rehearings of the orders above related to the export of 803   Bcf/yr  , 203   Bcf/yr   and 503.3   Bcf/yr   to non-FTA countries.  The   DOE   issued orders denying rehearing of the orders related to 803   Bcf/yr   and 503.3   Bcf/yr   but has not yet issued a final ruling on the rehearing request related to the 203   Bcf/yr  .  In July 2016, the same party petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the DOE order related to the export of 503.3 Bcf/yr to non-FTA countries and the order denying the request for rehearing of the same.  The appeal is pending.  In each case, the terms of these authorizations begin on the earlier of the date of first export thereunder or the date specified in the particular order, which ranges from five to 10 years from the date the order was issued.  In addition, we have a three-year makeup period with respect to each of the non-FTA orders for LNG volumes we were unable to export during the initial 20-year export period of  
  
   35 

such order.  Furthermore, in January 2016, the DOE issued an order authorizing us to export domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to   FTA countries   and   non-FTA countries   over a two-year period commencing on January 15, 2016, in an aggregate amount up to the equivalent of 600   Bcf   of natural gas (however, exports to   non-FTA countries   under this order, when combined with exports to   non-FTA countries   under the orders related to Trains 1 through 4 above, may not exceed 1,006   Bcf/yr  ). 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Trains 1 and 2 of the   SPL Project   had achieved substantial completion.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the overall project completion percentage for Trains 3 and 4 of the   SPL Project   was approximately   91.8%  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the overall project completion percentage for Train 5 of the   SPL Project   was approximately   42.8%   with engineering, procurement, subcontract work and construction approximately   90.8%  ,   62.0%  ,   41.9%   and   4.6%   complete, respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the overall project completion of each of our Trains was ahead of the contractual schedule.  We produced our first LNG from Train 1 of the   SPL Project   in February 2016 and achieved substantial completion in May 2016.  We produced our first LNG from Train 2 of the   SPL Project   in August 2016 and achieved substantial completion in September 2016.  Based on our current construction schedule, Trains 3 and 4 are expected to achieve substantial completion in 2017 and Train 5 is expected to achieve substantial completion in 2019. 
    
  Customers 
    
  SPL has entered into six fixed price, 20-year   SPA  s with third parties to make available an aggregate amount of LNG that equates to approximately 19.75   mtpa   of LNG, which is approximately 88% of the expected aggregate nominal production capacity of Trains 1 through 5.  The obligation to make LNG available under the SPAs commences from the date of first commercial delivery for Trains 1 through 5, as specified in each SPA.  Under these   SPA  s, the customers will purchase LNG from SPL for a price consisting of a fixed fee (a portion of which is subject to annual adjustment for inflation) per MMBtu of LNG plus a variable fee equal to 115% of   Henry Hub   per   MMBtu   of LNG.  In certain circumstances, the customers may elect to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, in which case the customers would still be required to pay the fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes that are not delivered as a result of such cancellation or suspension.  The   SPA  s and contracted volumes to be made available under the   SPA  s are not tied to a specific Train; however, the term of each   SPA   commences upon the start of operations of a specified Train.   
    
  In aggregate, the fixed fee portion to be paid by the third-party SPA customers is approximately $2.9 billion annually for Trains 1 through 5, with the applicable fixed fees starting from the date of first commercial delivery from the applicable Train.  These fixed fees equal approximately $411 million, $564 million, $650 million, $648 million and $588 million for each of Trains 1 through 5, respectively.   
    
  In addition, Cheniere Marketing has entered into an   SPA   with SPL to purchase, at Cheniere Marketing s option, any LNG produced by SPL in excess of that required for other customers.   
    
  Natural Gas Transportation, Storage and Supply 
    
  To ensure SPL is able to transport adequate natural gas feedstock to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, it has entered into transportation precedent and other agreements to secure firm pipeline transportation capacity with CTPL and third-party pipeline companies.  SPL has entered into firm storage services agreements with third parties to assist in managing volatility in natural gas needs for the   SPL Project  .  SPL has also entered into enabling agreements and long-term natural gas supply contracts with third parties in order to secure natural gas feedstock for the   SPL Project  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , SPL has secured up to approximately   1,982.0   million   MMBtu   of natural gas feedstock through long-term natural gas supply contracts. 
    
  Construction 
    
  SPL entered into lump sum turnkey contracts with Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc.   ( Bechtel )   for the engineering, procurement and construction of Trains 1 through 5, under which   Bechtel   charges a lump sum for all work performed and generally bears project cost risk unless certain specified events occur, in which case   Bechtel   may cause SPL to enter into a change order, or SPL agrees with   Bechtel   to a change order.   
    
  The total contract prices of the EPC contract for Trains 1 and 2, the EPC contract for Trains 3 and 4 and the EPC Contract for Train 5 of the   SPL Project   are approximately   $4.1 billion  ,   $3.9 billion   and   $3.0 billion  , respectively, reflecting amounts incurred under change orders through   September 30, 2016  .  Total expected capital costs for Trains 1 through 5 are estimated to be between  
  
   36 

$12.5 billion   and   $13.5 billion   before financing costs and between   $17.0 billion   and   $18.0 billion   after financing costs including, in each case, estimated owner s costs and contingencies.    
    
  Final Investment Decision on Train 6 
    
  We will contemplate making an   FID   to commence construction of Train 6 of the   SPL Project   based upon, among other things, entering into an   EPC   contract, entering into acceptable commercial arrangements and obtaining adequate financing to construct the Train. 
    
  Capital Resources 
    
  We currently expect that SPL s capital resources requirements with respect to Trains 1 through 5 of the   SPL Project   will be financed through one or more of the following: borrowings, equity contributions from Cheniere Partners and cash flows under the   SPA  s.  We believe that with the net proceeds of borrowings, available commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  , available commitments under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   (as defined below) and cash flows from operations, we will have adequate financial resources available to complete Trains 1 through 5 of the   SPL Project   and to meet our currently anticipated capital, operating and debt service requirements.  SPL began generating cash flows from operations from the   SPL Project   in May 2016, when Train 1 achieved substantial completion and initiated operating activities.  Additionally, during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we realized offsets to LNG terminal costs of   $68.3 million   and   $214.3 million  , respectively, that were related to the sale of commissioning cargoes because these amounts were earned prior to the start of commercial operations, during the testing phase for the construction of Trains 1 and 2 of the   SPL Project  . 
       
  Senior Secured Notes 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Cheniere Partners  subsidiaries had nine series of senior secured notes outstanding: 
             
  Interest on the   SPL Senior Notes   is payable semi-annually in arrears.  Subject to permitted liens, the   SPLNG Senior Notes   are secured on a   pari passu   first-priority basis by a security interest in all of SPLNG s equity interests and substantially all of SPLNG s operating assets.  The   SPL Senior Notes   are secured on a first-priority basis by a security interest in all of the membership interests in SPL and substantially all of SPL s assets. 
    
  SPLNG may redeem all or part of its   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of:  
     1.0% of the principal amount of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  ; or  
             
    the excess of: (1) the present value at such redemption date of (a) the redemption price of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   plus (b) all required interest payments due on the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over (2) the principal amount of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  , if greater. 

37 

SPLNG may redeem all or part of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   at any time on or after November 1, 2016 at fixed redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. 
    
  At any time prior to three months before the respective dates of maturity for each series of the   SPL Senior Notes  , SPL may redeem all or part of such series of the   SPL Senior Notes   at a redemption price equal to the  make-whole  price set forth in the common indenture governing the   SPL Senior Notes     (the  SPL Indenture )  , plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.  SPL may also, at any time within three months of the respective maturity dates for each series of the   SPL Senior Notes  , redeem all or part of such series of the   SPL Senior Notes   at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series of the   SPL Senior Notes   to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. 
    
  On October 14, 2016, SPLNG issued a notice of redemption to redeem all of its outstanding   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  .  The redemption date will be November 30, 2016 (the  Redemption Date ) and the price will be equal to 103.250% of the principal amount of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   to, but not including, the Redemption Date.  Concurrently with the redemption of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  , SPLNG intends to repay all of its outstanding   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  , which mature on the Redemption Date, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   to, but not including, the Redemption Date.  The redemption of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   and the repayment of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   will be funded with borrowings under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   Cheniere Partners entered into in February 2016, as further described below. 
    
  Under the indentures governing the   SPLNG Senior Notes     (the  SPLNG Indentures )  , except for permitted tax distributions, SPLNG may not make distributions until, among other requirements, deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts and a fixed charge coverage ratio test of 2:1 is satisfied.  Under the   SPL Indenture  , SPL may not make any distributions until, among other requirements, deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts as required and a debt service coverage ratio test of 1.25:1.00 is satisfied.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , SPLNG made distributions of   $230.4 million   and   $267.9 million  , respectively, after satisfying all the applicable conditions in the   SPLNG Indentures  . 
    
  The   SPL Indenture   includes restrictive covenants.  SPL may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including by issuing additional notes, and such indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and have different maturity dates and more restrictive covenants than the current outstanding indebtedness of SPL, including the   SPL Senior Notes  , the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   and the   SPL Working Capital Facility  .  
       
    2015 SPL Credit Facilities    
    
  In June 2015, SPL entered into the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   with commitments aggregating $4.6 billion.  The   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   are being used to fund a portion of the costs of developing, constructing and placing into operation Trains 1 through 5 of the   SPL Project  .  Borrowings under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   may be refinanced, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty; however, interest rate hedging and interest rate breakage costs may be incurred.  During 2016, in conjunction with the issuance of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  , SPL prepaid outstanding borrowings and terminated commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   for approximately   $2.6 billion  .  These prepayments and termination of commitments resulted in a write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   of   $25.8 million   and   $51.8 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , SPL had   $2.0 billion   of available commitments and   no   outstanding borrowings under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  .  
    
  Loans under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   accrue interest at a variable rate per annum equal to, at SPL s election,   LIBOR   or the base rate plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margin for   LIBOR   loans ranges from 1.30% to 1.75%, depending on the applicable   2015 SPL Credit Facility  , and the applicable margin for base rate loans is 1.75%.  Interest on   LIBOR   loans is due and payable at the end of each   LIBOR   period and interest on base rate loans is due and payable at the end of each quarter.  In addition, SPL is required to pay insurance/guarantee premiums of 0.45% per annum on any drawn amounts under the covered tranches of the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  .  The   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   also require SPL to pay a quarterly commitment fee calculated at a rate per annum equal to either: (1) 40% of the applicable margin, multiplied by the average daily amount of the undrawn commitment, or (2) 0.70% of the undrawn commitment, depending on the applicable   2015 SPL Credit Facility  .  The principal of the loans made under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   must be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing with the earlier of June 30, 2020 and the last day of the first full calendar quarter after the completion date of Trains 1 through 5 of the   SPL  
  
   38 

Project  .  Scheduled repayments are based upon an 18-year amortization profile, with the remaining balance due upon the maturity of the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  . 
    
  The   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   contain conditions precedent for borrowings, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants.  The obligations of SPL under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   are secured by substantially all of the assets of SPL as well as all of the membership interests in SPL on a   pari passu   basis with the   SPL Senior Notes   and   SPL Working Capital Facility  . 
    
  Under the terms of the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  , SPL is required to hedge not less than 65% of the variable interest rate exposure of its projected outstanding borrowings, calculated on a weighted average basis in comparison to its anticipated draw of principal.  Additionally, SPL may not make any distributions until certain conditions have been met, including that deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts and a debt service coverage ratio test of 1.25:1.00 is satisfied. 
    
    2013 SPL Credit Facilities    
    
   In May 2013, SPL entered into four credit facilities aggregating $5.9 billion   (collectively, the  2013 SPL Credit Facilities )   to fund a portion of the costs of developing, constructing and placing into operation Trains 1 through 4 of the   SPL Project  .  In June 2015, the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities   were replaced with the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  . 
    
  In March 2015, in conjunction with SPL s issuance of the   2025 SPL Senior Notes  , SPL terminated approximately $1.8 billion of commitments under the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities  .  This termination and the replacement of the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities   with the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   in June 2015 resulted in a write-off of debt issuance costs and deferred commitment fees associated with the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities   of $96.3 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
    CTPL Term Loan    
    
  In May 2013, CTPL entered into the   CTPL Term Loan  , which was used to fund modifications to the   Creole Trail Pipeline   and for general business purposes.  In February 2016, CTPL prepaid the full amount of $400.0 million outstanding under the   CTPL Term Loan   with capital contributions from Cheniere Partners, which in turn was funded with borrowings under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  .  This prepayment resulted in a write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $1.5 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
    2016 CQP Credit Facilities 
    
  In February 2016, Cheniere Partners entered into the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  .  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   consist of: (1) a   $450.0 million   CTPL tranche term loan that was used to prepay the   $400.0 million     CTPL Term Loan   in February 2016, (2) an approximately   $2.1 billion   SPLNG tranche term loan that will be used to redeem or repay the approximately   $2.1 billion   of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   and the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   (which must be redeemed or repaid concurrently under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   ), (3) the   $125.0 million     DSR Facility   that may be used to satisfy a   six  -month debt service reserve requirement and (4) a   $115.0 million   revolving credit facility that may be used for general business purposes.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Cheniere Partners had   $2.3 billion   of available commitments,   $7.5 million   aggregate amount of issued letters of credit and   $450.0 million   of outstanding borrowings under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  . 
    
  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   accrue interest at a variable rate per annum equal to LIBOR or the base rate (equal to the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50% and adjusted one month LIBOR plus 1.0%), plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margin for LIBOR loans is 2.25% per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans is 1.25% per annum, in each case with a 0.50% step-up beginning on February 25, 2019.  Interest on LIBOR loans is due and payable at the end of each applicable LIBOR period (and at the end of every three month period within the LIBOR period, if any), and interest on base rate loans is due and payable at the end of each calendar quarter.  
    
  Cheniere Partners incurred   $48.7 million   of debt issuance costs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and will incur an additional   $21.5 million   of debt issuance costs when the SPLNG tranche is funded.  Cheniere Partners pays a commitment fee equal to an annual rate of   40%   of the margin for LIBOR loans multiplied by the average daily amount of the undrawn commitment, payable quarterly in arrears.  The DSR Facility and the revolving credit facility are both available for the issuance of letters of credit, which incur a fee equal to an annual rate of   2.25%   of the undrawn portion with a   0.50%   step-up beginning on February 25, 2019.   
  
   39 

The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   mature on February 25, 2020, and the outstanding balance may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, except for interest hedging and interest rate breakage costs.  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   contain conditions precedent for extensions of credit, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and limit Cheniere Partners  ability to make restricted payments, including distributions, to once per fiscal quarter as long as certain conditions are satisfied.  Under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  , Cheniere Partners is required to hedge not less than   50%   of the variable interest rate exposure on its projected aggregate outstanding balance, maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of at least   1.15  x at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning March 31, 2019 and have a projected debt service coverage ratio of   1.55  x in order to incur additional indebtedness to refinance a portion of the existing obligations. 
    
  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   are unconditionally guaranteed by each subsidiary of Cheniere Partners other than: (1) SPL, (2) SPLNG until funding of its tranche term loan and (3) certain of the subsidiaries of Cheniere Partners owning other development projects, as well as certain other specified subsidiaries and members of the foregoing entities. 
    
    SPL Working Capital Facility    
    
  In September 2015, SPL entered into a $1.2 billion Amended and Restated Senior Working Capital Revolving Credit and Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement   (the  SPL Working Capital Facility )  , which replaced the $325.0 million Senior Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement that was entered into in April 2014.  The   SPL Working Capital Facility   is intended to be used for loans to SPL   ( Working Capital Loans )  , the issuance of letters of credit, as well as for swing line loans to SPL   ( Swing Line Loans )  , primarily for certain working capital requirements related to developing and placing into operation the   SPL Project  .  SPL may, from time to time, request increases in the commitments under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   of up to $760 million and, upon the completion of the debt financing of Train 6 of the   SPL Project  , request an incremental increase in commitments of up to an additional $390 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , SPL had   $764.5 million   of available commitments,   $337.0 million   aggregate amount of issued letters of credit and   $98.5 million   of loans outstanding under the   SPL Working Capital Facility  .  As of December 31, 2015, SPL had $1.1 billion of available commitments, $135.2 million aggregate amount of issued letters of credit and $15.0 million of loans outstanding under the   SPL Working Capital Facility  . 
    
  The   SPL Working Capital Facility   accrues interest at a variable rate per annum equal to LIBOR or the base rate (equal to the highest of the senior facility agent s published prime rate, the federal funds effective rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50% and one month LIBOR plus 0.50%), plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margin for LIBOR loans under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   is 1.75% per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   is 0.75% per annum.  Interest on   Swing Line Loans   and loans deemed made in connection with a draw upon a letter of credit   ( LC Loans )   is due and payable on the date the loan becomes due.  Interest on LIBOR   Working Capital Loans   is due and payable at the end of each applicable LIBOR period, and interest on base rate   Working Capital Loans   is due and payable at the end of each fiscal quarter.  However, if such base rate Working Capital Loan is converted into a LIBOR Working Capital Loan, interest is due and payable on that date.  Additionally, if the loans become due prior to such periods, the interest also becomes due on that date. 
    
  SPL pays (1) a commitment fee equal to an annual rate of 0.70% on the average daily amount of the excess of the total commitment amount over the principal amount outstanding without giving effect to any outstanding   Swing Line Loans   and (2) a letter of credit fee equal to an annual rate of 1.75% of the undrawn portion of all letters of credit issued under the   SPL Working Capital Facility  .  If draws are made upon a letter of credit issued under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   and SPL does not elect for such draw   (an  LC Draw )   to be deemed an LC Loan, SPL is required to pay the full amount of the   LC Draw   on or prior to the business day following the notice of the   LC Draw  .  An   LC Draw   accrues interest at an annual rate of 2.0% plus the base rate.  As of   September 30, 2016  , no   LC Draw  s had been made upon any letters of credit issued under the   SPL Working Capital Facility  .  
    
  The   SPL Working Capital Facility   matures on December 31, 2020, and the outstanding balance may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty upon three business days  notice.    LC Loans   have a term of up to one year.    Swing Line Loans   terminate upon the earliest of (1) the maturity date or earlier termination of the   SPL Working Capital Facility  , (2) the date 15 days after such Swing Line Loan is made and (3) the first borrowing date for a Working Capital Loan or Swing Line Loan occurring at least three business days following the date the Swing Line Loan is made.  SPL is required to reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all   Working Capital Loans   to zero for a period of five consecutive business days at least once each year.  

40 

The   SPL Working Capital Facility   contains conditions precedent for extensions of credit, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants.  The obligations of SPL under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   are secured by substantially all of the assets of SPL as well as all of the membership interests in SPL on a   pari passu   basis with the   SPL Senior Notes   and the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  . 
    
  Corpus Christi LNG Terminal 
    
  Liquefaction Facilities 
    
  The   CCL Project   is being developed and constructed at the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, on nearly 2,000 acres of land that we own or control near Corpus Christi, Texas.  In December 2014, we received authorization from the   FERC   to site, construct and operate Stages 1 and 2 of the   CCL Project  .  In May 2015, we commenced construction of   Stage 1   of the   CCL Project  .   
    
  Through the CCL Stage III entities, which are separate from the CCH Group, we are developing two additional Trains and one LNG storage tank at the Corpus Christi LNG terminal adjacent to the   CCL Project  , along with a second natural gas pipeline, and we commenced the regulatory approval process in June 2015.  
    
  The   DOE   has authorized the export of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the   CCL Project   to   FTA countries   for a 25-year term and to   non-FTA countries   for a 20-year term up to a combined total of the equivalent of 767   Bcf/yr   (approximately 15 mtpa) of natural gas.  Additionally, the DOE has authorized the export of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the two additional Trains being developed adjacent to the   CCL Project   to FTA countries for a 20-year term in an amount equivalent to 514 Bcf/yr (approximately 10 mtpa) of natural gas.  The application for authorization to export that same 514 Bcf/yr of domestically produced LNG by vessel to non-FTA countries is currently pending at the DOE.  In each case, the terms of these authorizations begin on the earlier of the date of first export thereunder or the date specified in the particular order, which ranges from 7 to 10 years from the date the order was issued.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the overall project completion percentage for   Stage 1   of the   CCL Project   was approximately   43.0%   with engineering, procurement and construction approximately   99.3%  ,   59.0%   and   14.4%   complete, respectively.  The construction of the   Corpus Christi Pipeline   is planned to commence in early 2017.  Based on our current construction schedule, we anticipate that Trains 1 and 2 of the   CCL Project   will achieve substantial completion in 2019.  
    
  Customers  
    
  CCL has entered into seven fixed price, 20-year   SPA  s with six third parties to make available an aggregate amount of LNG that equates to approximately 7.7   mtpa   of LNG, which is approximately 86% of the expected aggregate nominal production capacity of Trains 1 and 2.  The obligation to make LNG available under these SPAs commences from the date of first commercial delivery for Trains 1 and 2, as specified in each SPA.  In addition, CCL has entered into one fixed price, 20-year SPA with a third party for another 0.8 mtpa of LNG that commences with the date of first commercial delivery for Train 3.  Under these eight   SPA  s, the customers will purchase LNG from CCL for a price consisting of a fixed fee of $3.50 (a portion of which is subject to annual adjustment for inflation) per MMBtu of LNG plus a variable fee equal to 115% of   Henry Hub   per   MMBtu   of LNG.  In certain circumstances, the customers may elect to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, in which case the customers would still be required to pay the fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes that are not delivered as a result of such cancellation or suspension.  The   SPA  s and contracted volumes to be made available under the   SPA  s are not tied to a specific Train; however, the term of each   SPA   commences upon the start of operations of a specified Train. 
    
  In aggregate, the fixed fee portion to be paid by the third-party SPA customers is approximately $1.4 billion annually for Trains 1 and 2, and $1.5 billion if we make a positive   FID   with respect to   Stage 2   of the   CCL Project  , with the applicable fixed fees starting from the date of first commercial delivery from the applicable Train.  These fixed fees equal approximately $550 million, $846 million and $140 million for each of Trains 1 through 3, respectively.   
    
  In addition, Cheniere Marketing has entered into   SPA  s with CCL to purchase, at Cheniere Marketing s option, any LNG produced by CCL that is not required for other customers.

Natural Gas Transportation, Storage and Supply 
    
  To ensure CCL is able to transport adequate natural gas feedstock to the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, it has entered into transportation precedent agreements to secure firm pipeline transportation capacity with CCP and certain third-party pipeline companies.  CCL has entered into a firm storage services agreement with a third party to assist in managing volatility in natural gas needs for the   CCL Project  .  CCL has also entered into enabling agreements with third parties, and will continue to enter into such agreements, in order to secure natural gas feedstock for the   CCL Project  .  We expect to enter into gas supply contracts under these enabling agreements as and when required for the   CCL Project  . 
    
  Construction 
    
  CCL entered into separate lump sum turnkey contracts with   Bechtel   for the engineering, procurement and construction of Stages 1 and 2 of the   CCL Project   under which   Bechtel   charges a lump sum for all work performed and generally bears project cost risk unless certain specified events occur, in which case   Bechtel   may cause CCL to enter into a change order, or CCL agrees with   Bechtel   to a change order.   
    
  The total contract prices of the   EPC   contracts for Stages 1 and 2, which do not include the   Corpus Christi Pipeline  , are approximately   $7.6 billion   and   $2.4 billion  , respectively, reflecting amounts incurred under change orders through   September 30, 2016  .  Total expected capital costs for Stages 1 and 2 are estimated to be between   $12.0 billion   and   $13.0 billion   before financing costs, and between   $15.0 billion   and   $16.0 billion   after financing costs including, in each case, estimated owner s costs and contingencies.  Total expected capital costs for   Stage 1   only are estimated to be between   $9.0 billion   and   $10.0 billion   before financing costs, and between   $11.0 billion   and   $12.0 billion   after financing costs including, in each case, estimated owner s costs and contingencies.  
    
  Final Investment Decision on   Stage 2    
    
  We will contemplate making an   FID   to commence construction of   Stage 2   of the   CCL Project   based upon, among other things, entering into acceptable commercial arrangements and obtaining adequate financing to construct the facility. 
    
  Capital Resources 
    
  We expect to finance the construction costs of the   CCL Project   from one or more of the following: project financing, operating cash flow from CCL and CCP and equity contributions from Cheniere.  
    
  2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes    
    
   In May 2015, CCH HoldCo II issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 11% Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2025   (the  2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes )   on a private placement basis.  The $1.0 billion principal of the   2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes   will be used to partially fund costs associated with   Stage 1   of the   CCL Project   and the   Corpus Christi Pipeline  .  The   2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes   bear interest at a rate of 11.0% per annum, which is payable quarterly in arrears.  Prior to the substantial completion of Train 2 of the   CCL Project  , interest on the   2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes   will be paid entirely in kind.  Following this date, the interest generally must be paid in cash; however, a portion of the interest may be paid in kind under certain specified circumstances.  The   2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes   are secured by a pledge by us of 100% of the equity interests in CCH HoldCo II, and a pledge by CCH HoldCo II of 100% of the equity interests in CCH HoldCo I.  
    
  At   CCH HoldCo II   s option, the outstanding   2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes   are convertible into our common stock, provided that our total market capitalization at that time is not less than $10.0 billion, on or after the later of (1) 58 months from May 1, 2015, and (2) the substantial completion of Train 2 of the   CCL Project     (the  Eligible Conversion Date )  .  The conversion price for   2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes   converted at   CCH HoldCo II   s option is the lower of (1) a 10% discount to the average of the daily volume-weighted average price   ( VWAP )   of our common stock for the 90 trading day period prior to the date on which notice of conversion is provided, and (2) a 10% discount to the closing price of our common stock on the trading day preceding the date on which notice of conversion is provided.  At the option of the holders, the   2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes   are convertible on or after the six-month anniversary of the   Eligible Conversion Date   at a  
  
   42 

conversion price equal to the average of the daily   VWAP   of our common stock for the 90 trading day period prior to the date on which notice of conversion is provided.  Conversions are also subject to various limitations and conditions. 
    
  CCH HoldCo II is restricted from making distributions to Cheniere under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, Trains 1 and 2 of the   CCL Project   are in commercial operation and a historical debt service coverage ratio and a projected fixed debt service coverage ratio of 1.20:1.00 are achieved. 
    
  2024 CCH Senior Notes    
    
  In May 2016, CCH issued an aggregate principal amount of   $1.25 billion   of the   2024 CCH Senior Notes  .  Borrowings under the   2024 CCH Senior Notes   accrue interest at a fixed rate of   7.000%  , and interest on the   2024 CCH Senior Notes   is payable semi-annually in arrears. 
    
  The indenture governing the   2024 CCH Senior Notes     (the  CCH Indenture )   contains customary terms and events of default and certain covenants that, among other things, limit CCH s ability and the ability of CCH s restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions on membership interests or subordinated indebtedness or purchase, redeem or retire membership interests; sell or transfer assets, including membership or partnership interests of CCH s restricted subsidiaries; restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries to CCH or any of CCH s restricted subsidiaries; incur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; dissolve, liquidate, consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of the properties or assets of CCH and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole; or permit any guarantor to dissolve, liquidate, consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets.  
    
  At any time prior to January 1, 2024, CCH may redeem all or a part of the   2024 CCH Senior Notes   at a redemption price equal to the  make-whole  price set forth in the   CCH Indenture  , plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.  CCH also may at any time on or after January 1, 2024 through the maturity date of June 30, 2024, redeem the   2024 CCH Senior Notes  , in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the   2024 CCH Senior Notes   to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. 
    
  2015 CCH Credit Facility    
    
  In May 2015, CCH entered into the   2015 CCH Credit Facility  , which is being used to fund a portion of the costs associated with the development, construction, operation and maintenance of   Stage 1   of the   CCL Project   and the   Corpus Christi Pipeline  .  Borrowings under the   2015 CCH Credit Facility   may be refinanced, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty; however, interest rate hedging and interest rate breakage costs may be incurred.  In May 2016, in conjunction with the issuance of the   2024 CCH Senior Notes  , CCH prepaid approximately $1.1 billion of outstanding borrowings under the   2015 CCH Credit Facility  .  This prepayment resulted in a write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the   2015 CCH Credit Facility   of   $29.0 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , CCH had   $4.1 billion   of available commitments and   $3.3 billion   of outstanding borrowings under the   2015 CCH Credit Facility  . 
    
  The principal of the loans made under the   2015 CCH Credit Facility   must be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing on the earlier of (1) the first quarterly payment date occurring more than three calendar months following project completion and (2) a set date determined by reference to the date under which a certain LNG buyer linked to Train 2 of the   CCL Project   is entitled to terminate its   SPA   for failure to achieve the date of first commercial delivery for that agreement.  Scheduled repayments will be based upon a 19-year tailored amortization, commencing the first full quarter after the project completion and designed to achieve a minimum projected fixed debt service coverage ratio of 1.55:1.   
    
  Loans under the   2015 CCH Credit Facility   accrue interest at a variable rate per annum equal to, at CCH s election,   LIBOR   or the base rate, plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margins for   LIBOR   loans are 2.25% prior to completion of Trains 1 and 2 of the   CCL Project   and 2.50% on completion and thereafter.  The applicable margins for base rate loans are 1.25% prior to completion Trains 1 and 2 of the   CCL Project   and 1.50% on completion and thereafter.  Interest on   LIBOR   loans is due and payable at the end of each applicable interest period and interest on base rate loans is due and payable at the end of each quarter.  The   2015 CCH Credit Facility   also requires CCH to pay a commitment fee at a rate per annum equal to 40% of the margin for   LIBOR   loans, multiplied by the outstanding undrawn debt commitments.   
    
  The obligations of CCH under the   2015 CCH Credit Facility   are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of CCH and its subsidiaries and by a pledge by CCH HoldCo I of its limited liability company interests in CCH. 
  
   43 

Under the terms of the   2015 CCH Credit Facility  , CCH is required to hedge not less than 65% of the variable interest rate exposure of its senior secured debt.  CCH is restricted from making distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, the completion of the construction of Trains 1 and 2 of the   CCL Project  , funding of a debt service reserve account equal to six months of debt service and achieving a historical debt service coverage ratio and fixed projected debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00. 
  LNG and Natural Gas Marketing Business 
    
  Cheniere Marketing is engaged in the LNG and natural gas marketing business and is developing a portfolio of long-term, short-term and spot LNG   SPA  s.  Cheniere Marketing has purchased, transported and unloaded commercial LNG cargoes into the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and other LNG terminals worldwide and has used trading strategies intended to maximize margins on these cargoes.  Cheniere Marketing has secured the following rights and obligations to support its business: 
             
    pursuant to an   SPA   with SPL, the right to purchase, at Cheniere Marketing s option, any LNG produced by SPL in excess of that required for other customers; 
                
    pursuant to   SPA  s with CCL, the right to purchase, at Cheniere Marketing s option, any LNG produced by CCL that is not required for other customers; and 
                
    a portfolio of LNG vessel time charters. 
     In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , Cheniere Marketing has sold approximately   500 million   MMBtu of LNG to be delivered to counterparties between 2016 and 2023, with delivery obligations conditional in certain circumstances.  The cargoes have been sold with a portfolio of delivery points, either on a Free on Board basis (delivered to the counterparty at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal) or a Delivered at Terminal   ( DAT )   basis (delivered to the counterparty at their LNG receiving terminal).  Cheniere Marketing has chartered LNG vessels to be utilized in   DAT   transactions.  In addition, Cheniere Marketing has entered into a long-term agreement to sell LNG cargoes on a   DAT   basis.  The agreement is conditioned upon the buyer achieving certain milestones, including reaching an   FID   related to certain projects and obtaining related financing. 
    
  Cheniere Marketing entered into uncommitted trade finance facilities for up to $470.0 million primarily for the purchase of natural gas, LNG or other energy products for ultimate resale in the course of its business.  The finance facilities are intended to be used for advances, guarantees or the issuance of letters of credit or standby letters of credit on behalf of Cheniere Marketing.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Cheniere Marketing had   $18.8 million   in loans and   $5.8 million   in standby letters of credit and guarantees outstanding under the finance facilities.  Cheniere Marketing pays interest or fees on utilized commitments.  
    
  Corporate and Other Activities 
    
  We are required to maintain corporate and general and administrative functions to serve our business activities described above.  We are also in various stages of developing other projects which, among other things, will require acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make an   FID  .  We have proposed the development of a pipeline with expected capacity of up to 1.4   Bcf/d   connecting new gas production in the Anadarko Basin to Gulf Coast markets, including markets serving the   SPL Project   and the   CCL Project  .  We expect the regulatory pre-filing process to commence imminently and to file formal applications for the required regulatory permits in 2017.  We are also exploring the development of a midscale liquefaction project using electric drive modular Trains, with an expected aggregate nominal production capacity of approximately 9.5 mtpa of LNG.

Sources and Uses of Cash 
    
  The following table (in thousands) summarizes the sources and uses of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures, including accruals, which are referred to elsewhere in this report.  Additional discussion of these items follows the table.  

Operating Cash Flows 
    
  Operating cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $318.9 million   and   $367.2 million  , respectively.  The decrease in operating cash outflows in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily related to increased cash receipts from the sale of LNG cargoes, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses as a result of the commencement of operations of Trains 1 and 2 of the   SPL Project   in May and September 2016, respectively, and increased cash payout for phantom unit awards. 
    
  Investing Cash Flows 
    
  Investing cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $3.5 billion   and   $5.9 billion  , respectively, and are primarily used to fund the construction costs for Trains 1 through 5 of the   SPL Project   and Trains 1 and 2 of the   CCL Project  .  These costs are capitalized as construction-in-process until achievement of substantial completion.  Additionally, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we used   $51.3 million   and   $111.5 million  , respectively, primarily to pay municipal water districts for water system enhancements that will increase potable water supply to our export terminals, payments made for capital assets purchased pursuant to information technology services agreements, collateral payments for the   CCL Project   and for investments made in unconsolidated entities. 
    
  Financing Cash Flows 
    
  Financing cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $3.9 billion  , primarily as a result of: 
               
    issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $1.3 billion of the   2024 CCH Senior Notes   in May 2016, which were used to prepay $1.1 billion of the outstanding borrowings under the   2015 CCH Credit Facility  ; 
      
   45 

issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   in June 2016, which was used to prepay $1.3 billion of the outstanding borrowings under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  ; 
                
    issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion of the   2027 SPL Senior Notes   in September 2016, which was used to prepay $1.2 billion of the outstanding borrowings under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   and pay a portion of the capital costs in connection with the construction of Trains 1 through 5 of the   SPL Project  ; 
                
    $18.8 million of borrowings under the Cheniere Marketing trade finance facilities; 
                
    $313.5 million of borrowings and a $230.0 million repayment made under the   SPL Working Capital Facility  ; 
                
    $116.7 million   of debt issuance and deferred financing costs related to up-front fees paid upon the closing of these transactions;  
                
    $60.2 million   of distributions and dividends to non-controlling interest by Cheniere Partners and Cheniere Holdings; and 
                
    $18.6 million   paid for tax withholdings for share-based compensation. 
       
  Financing cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   were   $5.6 billion  , primarily as a result of: 
                  
    $519.7 million   of debt issuance and deferred financing costs related to up-front fees paid upon the closing of these transactions; 
                
    $60.2 million   of distributions and dividends to non-controlling interest by Cheniere Partners and Cheniere Holdings; and 
                
    $44.3 million   paid for tax withholdings for share-based compensation. 

Results of Operations 
    
  Our consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders was   $100.4 million  , or   $0.44     per share (basic and diluted), in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of   $297.8 million  , or   $1.31   per share (basic and diluted), in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  This   $197.4 million   decrease in net loss in 2016 was primarily a result of decreased derivative loss, net, and increased income from operations, which was partially offset by increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, and restructuring expense. 
    
  Our consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders was   $719.7 million  , or   $3.15   per share (basic and diluted), in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of   $684.0 million  , or   $3.02   per share (basic and diluted), in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This   $35.7 million   increase in net loss in 2016 was primarily a result of increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, and restructuring expense, which was partially offset by decreased loss from operations. 
    
  Revenues 

46 

We began recognizing LNG revenues from the   SPL Project   following the substantial completion of Trains 1 and 2 in May and September 2016, respectively.  Prior to these dates, amounts received from the sale of commissioning cargoes were offset against LNG terminal construction-in-process because these amounts were earned during the testing phase for the construction of those Trains of the   SPL Project  .  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we loaded a total of   60.3 million   MMBtu and   113.8 million   MMBtu of LNG, respectively, of which   50.8 million   MMBtu and   69.0 million   MMBtu, respectively, resulted in the recognition of revenues related to this volume.  The remaining   9.5 million   MMBtu and   44.8 million   MMBtu of LNG loaded during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, were recognized as offsets to LNG terminal costs as they related to the sale of commissioning cargoes.  Additionally, LNG revenues included revenues from Cheniere Marketing of $123.5 million and $163.3 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as well as derivative gains and losses related to commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives. 
    
  Operating costs and expenses 

Our total operating costs and expenses increased   $332.3 million   and   $452.7 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, primarily as a result of the commencement of operations of Trains 1 and 2 of the   SPL Project   in May and September 2016, respectively, compared to a significant cost recovery recorded during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This cost recovery was due to a $32.2 million increase in fair value for our natural gas supply contracts recorded for the period, which we recognized following the completion and placement into service of certain modifications to the underlying pipeline infrastructure and the resulting development of a market for physical gas delivery at locations specified in a portion of our natural gas supply contracts.  Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly for the production and delivery of LNG from the   SPL Project   such as natural gas feedstock, variable transportation and storage costs, derivative gains and losses associated with economic hedges to secure natural gas feedstock for the   SPL Project  , and other related costs to convert natural gas into LNG, all to the extent not utilized for the commissioning process, as well as cost of sales related to our LNG and natural gas marketing business by Cheniere Marketing.  Included in cost of sales during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was vessel charter costs of $20.8 million and $36.9 million, respectively, which were incurred throughout the period, including the period prior to substantial completion of Trains 1 and 2 of the   SPL Project  .  Operating and maintenance expense includes costs associated with operating and maintaining the   SPL Project   such as third-party service and maintenance contract costs, payroll and benefit costs of operations personnel, natural gas transportation and storage capacity demand charges, derivative gains and losses related to the sale and purchase of LNG associated with the regasification terminal, insurance and regulatory costs.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   as we began depreciation of our assets related to Trains 1 and 2 of the   SPL Project   upon reaching substantial completion.  Additionally, in 2015, we initiated certain organizational changes to simplify our corporate structure, improve our operational efficiencies and implement a strategy for sustainable, long-term stockholder value creation through financially disciplined development, construction, operation and investment.  As a result of these efforts, we recorded   $26.2 million   and   $49.2 million   of restructuring charges and other costs associated with restructuring and operational efficiency initiatives during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.   
    
  Offsetting the increases above was a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense, which was primarily due to the timing of share-based compensation recognition and the recognition of certain employee-related costs within restructuring expense during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   historically reported in selling, general and administrative expense, a reduction in certain professional services fees and reallocation of costs from selling, general and administrative activities to operating and maintenance activities following commencement of operations at the   SPL Project  .  Development expense also decreased during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , due to an FID made on Train 5 of the   SPL Project   in June 2015 and an FID made on Trains 1 and 2 of the   CCL Project   in May 2015. 

47 

Other expense (income) 

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased   $54.5 million   and   $91.7 million   in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of an increase in our indebtedness outstanding (before premium, discount and unamortized debt issuance costs), from $16.3 billion as of   September 30, 2015   to   $21.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , and the decrease in the portion of total interest costs that could be capitalized as Trains 1 and 2 of the   SPL Project   were no longer in construction.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $340.8 million   and   $951.3 million   of total interest cost, respectively, of which we capitalized   $192.7 million   and   $620.9 million  , respectively, which were directly related to the construction of the SPL Project and the CCL Project.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $286.0 million   and   $707.8 million   of total interest cost, respectively, of which we capitalized   $192.4 million   and   $469.2 million  , respectively, which were directly related to the construction of the SPL Project and the CCL Project. 
    
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt increased   $25.8 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015   whereas it decreased   $13.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Loss on early extinguishment of debt during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was attributable to the   $25.8 million   write-off of debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of outstanding borrowings and termination of commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   of approximately   $1.4 billion   in September 2016 in connection with the issuance of the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  .  Loss on early extinguishment of debt during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   further included a   $29.0 million   write-off of debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of approximately   $1.1 billion   of outstanding borrowings under the   2015 CCH Credit Facility   in May 2016 in connection with the issuance of the   2024 CCH Senior Notes  , a $26.0 million write-off of debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding borrowings under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   in June 2016 in connection with the issuance of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes  , and a   $1.5 million   write-off of debt issuance costs and unamortized discount in connection with the prepayment of the CTPL Term Loan in February 2016.  Loss on early extinguishment of debt during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was attributable to a $7.3 million write-off of debt issuance costs and deferred commitment fees related to the termination and replacement of the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities   with the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   in June 2015 and a $89.0 million write-off of debt issuance costs and deferred commitment fees related to the termination of approximately   $1.8 billion   of commitments under the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities   in March 2015. 
    
  Derivative loss (gain), net decreased   $190.8 million   from a loss of   $161.5 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to a gain of   $29.3 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a relative increase in the forward LIBOR curve in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Derivative loss, net did not significantly change between the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  Derivative loss, net during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to a decrease in the forward LIBOR curve during the period and an increase in the notional amounts of our interest rate derivatives.  Derivative loss, net recognized during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily due to a decrease in the forward LIBOR curve during the period, the loss incurred upon meeting the contingency related to the CCH Interest Rate Derivatives and the loss recognized upon the termination of interest rate swaps associated with approximately $1.8 billion of commitments that were terminated under the 2013 SPL Credit Facilities. 
    
  Other 

Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest increased   $20.7 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the increase in consolidated net loss recognized by Cheniere Partners in which the non-controlling interest is held.  The consolidated net loss recognized by Cheniere Partners increased from   $24.1 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to   $81.5 million   in the   three months ended September  
  
   48 

30, 2016   primarily due to increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, and increased loss on early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by decreased derivative loss and increased income from operations primarily as a result of the commencement of operations of Trains 1 and 2 of the   SPL Project  .  Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest decreased   $6.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increased income from operations, decreased loss on early extinguishment of debt and decreased derivative loss, net, which were partially offset by increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no transactions that met the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial position or operating results.  

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with   GAAP   requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes.  There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  Cash Investments 
    
  We have cash investments that we manage based on internal investment guidelines that emphasize liquidity and preservation of capital.  Such cash investments are stated at historical cost, which approximates fair market value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Marketing and Trading Commodity Price Risk 
    
  We have entered into commodity derivatives consisting of natural gas supply contracts to secure natural gas feedstock for the   SPL Project     ( Liquefaction Supply Derivatives )  .  In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the   Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   to changes in underlying commodity prices, management modeled a 10% change in the basis price for natural gas for each delivery location.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimated the fair value of the   Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   to be   $12.1 million  .  Based on actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase or decrease in the underlying basis prices would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the   Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   of   $0.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to $0.9 million as of   December 31, 2015  .  See    Note 6 Derivative Instruments    for additional details about our derivative instruments. 
    
  We have also entered into financial derivatives to hedge the exposure to the commodity markets in which we have contractual arrangements to purchase or sell physical LNG   ( LNG Trading Derivatives )  .  In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the   LNG Trading Derivatives   to changes in underlying commodity prices, management modeled a 10% change in the basis price for LNG.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimated the fair value of the   LNG Trading Derivatives   to be a liability of   $0.3 million  .  Based on actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase or decrease in the underlying basis price would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the   LNG Trading Derivatives   of   $4.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , whereas it was immaterial as of   December 31, 2015  .  See    Note 6 Derivative Instruments    for additional details about our derivative instruments. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  SPL has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to volatility in a portion of the floating-rate interest payments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities     ( SPL Interest Rate Derivatives )  .  In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the   SPL Interest Rate Derivatives   to changes in interest rates, management modeled a 10% change in the forward 1-month   LIBOR   curve across the remaining term of the   SPL Interest Rate Derivatives  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimated the fair value of the   SPL Interest Rate Derivatives   to be a liability of   $15.9 million  .  This 10% change in interest rates would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the   SPL Interest Rate Derivatives   of   $1.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to $3.1 million as of  
  
   49 

December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in the effect of change in interest rates was due to a decrease in the forward 1-month   LIBOR   curve during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Cheniere Partners has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to volatility in a portion of the floating-rate interest payments under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities     ( CQP Interest Rate Derivatives )  .  In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the   CQP Interest Rate Derivatives   to changes in interest rates, management modeled a 10% change in the forward 1-month   LIBOR   curve across the remaining term of the   CQP Interest Rate Derivatives  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimated the fair value of the   CQP Interest Rate Derivatives   to be a liability of   $12.2 million  .  This 10% change in interest rates would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the   CQP Interest Rate Derivatives   of   $3.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  CCH has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to volatility in a portion of the floating-rate interest payments under the   2015 CCH Credit Facility     ( CCH Interest Rate Derivatives )  .  In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the   CCH Interest Rate Derivatives   to changes in interest rates, management modeled a 10% change in the forward 1-month   LIBOR   curve across the remaining term of the   CCH Interest Rate Derivatives  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimated the fair value of the   CCH Interest Rate Derivatives   to be a liability of   $297.5 million  .  This 10% change in interest rates would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the   CCH Interest Rate Derivatives   of   $38.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to $55.6 million as of   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in the effect of change in interest rates was due to a decrease in the forward 1-month   LIBOR   curve during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
    
  We have entered into foreign currency exchange ( FX ) contracts to hedge exposure to currency risk associated with operations in countries outside of the United States   ( FX Derivatives )  .  In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the   FX Derivatives   to changes in FX rates, management modeled a 10% change in FX rate between the U.S. dollar and the applicable foreign currencies.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimated the fair value of the   FX Derivatives   to be a liability of   $1.2 million  .  This 10% change in FX rates would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the   FX Derivatives   of   $0.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
       
  We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the   Exchange Act  , is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the   SEC   s rules and forms.

ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

  Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality ( LDEQ ) Matter 
    
  Please see Part II, Item 1,  Legal Proceedings - LDEQ Matter  in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016. 
    
  Parallax Litigation 
    
  In 2015, Cheniere Energy Inc. s ( CEI ) wholly owned subsidiary, Cheniere LNG Terminals, LLC ( CLNGT ), entered into discussions with Parallax Enterprises, LLC ( Parallax Enterprises ) regarding the potential joint development of two liquefaction plants in Louisiana (the  Potential Liquefaction Transactions ).  While the parties negotiated regarding the Potential Liquefaction Transactions, CLNGT loaned Parallax Enterprises approximately $46 million, as reflected in a secured note dated April 23, 2015, as amended on June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and November 4, 2015 (the  Secured Note ).  The Secured Note was secured by all assets of Parallax Enterprises and its subsidiary entities.  On June 30, 2015, Parallax Enterprises  parent entity, Parallax Energy LLC ( Parallax Energy ), executed a Pledge and Guarantee Agreement further securing repayment of the Secured Note by providing a parent guaranty and a pledge of all of the equity of Parallax Enterprises in satisfaction of the Secured Note (the  Pledge Agreement ).  CLNGT and Parallax Enterprises never executed a definitive agreement to pursue the Potential Liquefaction Transactions.  The Secured Note matured on December 11, 2015, and Parallax Enterprises failed to make payment.  On February 3, 2016, CLNGT filed an action against Parallax Energy, Parallax Enterprises, and certain of Parallax Enterprises  subsidiary entities, styled Cause No. 4:16-cv-00286, Cheniere LNG Terminals, LLC v. Parallax Energy LLC, et al., in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (the  Texas Suit ).  CLNGT asserted claims in the Texas Suit for (1) recovery of all amounts due under the Secured Note and (2) declaratory relief establishing that CLNGT is entitled to enforce its rights under the Secured Note and Pledge Agreement in accordance with each instrument s terms and that CLNGT has no obligations of any sort to Parallax Enterprises concerning the Potential Liquefaction Transactions.  On March 11, 2016, Parallax Enterprises and the other defendants in the Texas Suit moved to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  On August 2, 2016, the court denied the defendants  motion to dismiss without prejudice and permitted the parties to pursue jurisdictional discovery, which is ongoing.  
    
  On March 11, 2016, Parallax Enterprises filed a suit against CEI and CLNGT styled Civil Action No. 62-810, Parallax Enterprises LLP v. Cheniere Energy, Inc. and Cheniere LNG Terminals, LLC, in the 25th Judicial District Court of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana (the  Louisiana Suit ), wherein Parallax Enterprises asserted claims for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation, detrimental reliance, unjust enrichment and violation of the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act.  Parallax Enterprises predicated its claims in the Louisiana Suit on an allegation that CEI and CLNGT breached a purported agreement to jointly develop the Potential Liquefaction Transactions.  Parallax Enterprises sought $400 million in alleged economic damages and rescission of the Secured Note.  On April 15, 2016, CEI and CLNGT removed the Louisiana Suit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, which subsequently transferred the Louisiana Suit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, where it was assigned Civil Action No. 4:16-cv-01628 and transferred to the same judge presiding over the Texas Suit for coordinated handling.  On August 22, 2016, Parallax Enterprises voluntarily dismissed all claims asserted against CLNGT and CEI in the Louisiana Suit without prejudice to refiling.  CEI does not expect that the resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial results.
