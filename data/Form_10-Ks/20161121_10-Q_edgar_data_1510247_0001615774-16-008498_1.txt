Note 1. Nature of Business  

Throughout this report, the terms  our, 
 we,   us,  and the  Company  refer to LifeApps Brands Inc., including its subsidiaries.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of LifeApps Digital Media Inc. at September 30, 2016
and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial
statements, instructions to Form 10-Q, and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In management's opinion, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)
considered necessary for a fair presentation to make our financial statements not misleading have been included. The results of
operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full year. The December 31, 2015 balance sheet has been derived from our audited financial statements included in our
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

We are building health, fitness and
sports communities across multiple digital platforms including mobile apps, digital sports and fitness publications, sports and
fitness products, sporting events, gateway platforms, online websites and social media. 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies  

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), which contemplates our continuation
as a going concern. We have incurred losses to date of $2,701,003. To date we have funded our operations through advances from
a related party, issuance of convertible debt, and the sale of our common stock. We intend to raise additional funding through
third party equity or debt financing. There is no certainty that funding will be available as needed. These factors raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue operating as a going concern. Our ability to continue our operations as a going concern, realize
the carrying value of our assets, and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent upon our ability
to raise capital sufficient to fund our commitments and ongoing losses, and ultimately generate profitable operations. 

Principles of Consolidation  

 The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries, LifeApps Inc. and Sports One Group Inc. All
material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Financial Instruments  

 The estimated fair values for financial
instruments were determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information. These estimates involved uncertainties
and could not be determined with precision. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
approximated fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of notes payable approximated
to their carrying value as generally their interest rates reflected our effective annual borrowing rate.

Intangibles  

 Intangibles, which include websites
and databases acquired, internet domain name costs, and customer lists, are being amortized over the expected useful lives which
we estimate to be three to five years. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 350  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other  ( ASC 350 ), the
costs to obtain and register internet domain names were capitalized. 

Fixed Assets  

 Fixed assets consists of furniture
and equipment and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives used for financial statement
purposes is 3 years. 

Derivative Financial Instruments:   

 We do not use derivative instruments
to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if
such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments
that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued
at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial
instruments, we used a Black Scholes valuation model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation
dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as
equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current
or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months
of the balance sheet date. 

Revenue Recognition  

 Revenue is derived primarily from the
sale of sports and fitness apparel and equipment, and software applications designed for use on mobile devices such as smart phones
and tablets. Revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, the
product or service has been delivered, and collectability is probable. 

We sell our software directly via Internet
download through third party agents. We recognize revenue when payment is received from the agent. Payment is received net of
commission paid to the agent, usually 70% to us and 30% to the agent. We record the net amount received as revenue. 

We also publish and sell digital magazines
through the internet. Magazines can be purchased as individual volumes or as a subscription. To date we have not had any subscription
sales. 

Cost of Revenue  

 Cost of revenue includes the cost of
amounts paid for articles, photography, editorial and production cost of the magazine and ongoing web hosting costs. Cost of revenue
related to product sales includes the direct cost of those products sold. 

Research and development, Website
Development Costs, and Software Development Costs  

 All research and development costs
are expensed as incurred. Software development costs eligible for capitalization under ASC 350-50,  Website Development Cost ,
and ASC 985-20,  Software-Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed , were not material to our financial statements
for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Research and development expenses amounted to $0 and $0 for three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $200 and $7,797 for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Research and development expenses were included in general and administrative expenses.

Advertising Costs  

 We recognize advertising expense when
incurred. Advertising expense was $130 and $185 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $130
and $3,036 for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Rent Expense  

 We recognize rent expense on a straight-line
basis over the reasonably assured lease term as defined in ASC Topic 840,  Leases  ( ASC 840 ). Our lease is
short term and will be renewed on a month to month basis. Rent expense was $2,110 and $1,252 for the for three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $5,685 and $4,606 for the for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Equity-Based Compensation  

 Stock-based compensation is presented
in accordance with the guidance of ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ). Under
the provisions of ASC 718, companies are required to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant
using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense
over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations. 

Income Taxes  

  The provision for income taxes is
determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ). Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive
model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements, uncertain tax positions
taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements
when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must
initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

For the for three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 we did not have any interest, penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. 

Earnings per share   

 We calculate earnings per share in
accordance with ASC Topic 260  Earnings Per Share , which requires a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per
share. Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted
earnings per share represent basic earnings per share adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of outstanding stock
options and warrants. The diluted earnings per share were not calculated because we recorded net losses for the for three months
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the outstanding stock options and warrants are anti-dilutive. 

Recent Pronouncements  

 From time to time, new accounting pronouncements
are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date. We believe that the recently issued standards that are not yet effective
may not have an impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Note 5. Amounts Due Related Parties  

Parties, which can be a corporation
or an individual, are considered to be related if we have the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise
significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related
if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. 

Amount
due to related parties represent cash advances, salary accruals and amounts paid on our behalf by officers and shareholders of
the Company. These advances are non-interest bearing, short term in nature and due on demand. The balance at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, was $494,539 and $329,554, respectively. Salary accruals for each period amounted to $112,500    and
net cash advances amounted to $52,485 and $72,750, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

On March 25, 2015, we entered into
a debt conversion agreement with our CEO and principal stockholder. The agreement provided the CEO with the right to convert $31,250
owed to him for working capital loans made to the Company for 1,666,667 restricted shares of our common stock. The conversion
price was based on the following formula - equal to the lesser of $1.02 or 60% of the lowest trade price ($0.0025) in the 25 trading
days previous to the conversion. (In the event that Conversion Shares are not deliverable by DWAC, an additional 10% discount
shall apply; if the shares are ineligible for deposit into the DTC system and only eligible for Xclearing deposit, an additional
5% discount shall apply; and in the case of both, an additional cumulative 15% discount shall apply.) The conversion price as
calculated was $0.01875 per share (post-split basis). We recognized a loss on conversion of $47,500, the difference between the
conversion price and the closing trading price on the date of the conversion. 

Note 6. Convertible Notes Payable  

During 2014, we executed a Promissory
Note (the  Note ) and received three draws totaling $135,000. The Note is due March 17, 2016 and provides for an original
issue discount of $15,185, which was to be amortized over 24 months, and face interest rate of 12% per annum. The Lender had the
right, at any time at its election to convert all or part of the outstanding and unpaid principal and accrued interest into shares
of our common stock. The conversion price is the lesser of $0.0485 or 60% of the lowest trading price in the 25 trading days prior
the conversion. The Note provides for additional penalties if we cannot deliver the underlying common stock on a timely basis.
The Note also provides that the principal amount may be increased, with the consent of the lender to $445,000. 

We evaluated the terms of the conversion
features of the convertible debenture in accordance with ASC Topic No. 815 - 40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's
Own Stock and determined it is indexed to the Company's common stock and that the conversion features meet the definition of a
liability and therefore bifurcated the conversion feature and accounted for it as a separate derivative liability. 

We valued the conversion feature at
origination of all draws at $230,408 using the Black Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of
zero, 1.25 to 2 years to maturity, risk free interest rate of 0.38% to 0.58% and annualized volatility of 97.34% to 146%. $135,000
of the value assigned to the derivative liability was recognized as a debt discount on the convertible debenture. The debt discount
was recorded as reduction (contra-liability) to the convertible debenture and is being amortized over the life of the convertible
debenture. The balance of $95,408 of the value assigned to the derivative liability was recognized as origination interest on
the derivative liability and expensed on origination.

 September 30, 2016 and 2015 

 (Unaudited) 

We valued the derivative liability
and the end of each accounting period the difference in value is recognized as gain or loss. At September 30, 2015 we determined
the valuation using the Black-Sholes valuation model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of zero, 0.96 years to maturity,
risk free interest rate of 0.56% and annualized volatility of 167%. We recognized $189,660 of expense for the change in value
of the derivative for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, the lender converted $96,054 of the principal of the Note into 6,508,500 shares of our $0.001 common stock. The loans
were fully converted to common stock during August of 2015. 

Note 7. Stockholders  Equity  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2015 we issued 13,816,186 shares of common stock as a result of conversion of debt. As more fully described in Notes 5 and
6 above, of the shares issued, 6,508,500 were to an unrelated note holder and 7,307,686 were to officers and/or directors of the
Company. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 we issued 597,545 shares of common stock in settlement of $8,058 in previously accrued legal services. 

Note 8. Stock Based Compensation  

In prior periods, our Board of Directors
adopted the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2012 Plan ), which was approved by our shareholders. The 2012 Plan provided
for the issuance of up to 666,667 shares of our common stock. During October 2015 the Board of Directors amended the plan to increase
the number of shares issuable under the LifeApps Digital Media Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan to 20,000,000, on a post-Reverse
Stock Split basis. The plan provides for the award of options, stock appreciation rights, performance share awards, and restricted
stock and stock units. The plan is administered by the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the 2012 Plan our Board of Directors granted
options to purchase 418,333 shares of our common stock in periods prior to December 31, 2015. All of those options have been cancelled
or lapsed as of September 30, 2016. On May 24, 2016 our Board of Directors granted options to purchase 15,000,000 shares of our
common stock to officers and or directors and a consultant. The options are exercisable quarterly from the grant date over a four-year
term. 

The fair value of the options granted,
$39,000, was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the following assumptions: 

Expected life (in years)    
        4     
 
     Volatility    
        383  %  
 
     Risk Free interest rate    
        0.68  %  
 
     Dividend yield (on common stock)    
        -     

Stock based compensation expense for
the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $2,437. There was no stock based compensation expense
recorded for the period ended September 30, 2015 as the prior year options were fully vested during 2014.

 September 30, 2016 and 2015 

 (Unaudited) 

In accordance with ASC 740, at December
31, 2015 we determined that a valuation allowance should be recognized against deferred tax assets because, based on the weight
of available evidence, it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% probability) that some portion or all of the deferred
tax asset will not be realized in the future. We recognized a reserve of 100% of the amounts of the deferred tax benefit in the
amount of $663,700. 

As of September 30, 2016 we had cumulative
net operating loss carry forwards of $1,314,000 which expire from 2032 through 2036. 

There are open statutes of limitations
for taxing authorities in federal and state jurisdictions to audit our tax returns from 2010 through the current period. Our policy
is to account for income tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
There have been no income tax related interest or penalties assessed or recorded. 

Note 11. Business Segments  

We currently have two business segments;
(i) the sale of physical products ( Products ) and (ii) digital publishing ( Publishing ). The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. 

The publishing segment does not meet
the quantitative threshold for disclosure as outlined ASC Topic 280  Segment Reporting.  

All of our revenue is generated in
the United States and accordingly no geographic segment reporting is included. 

No customers accounted for more than
10% of our revenues in the periods September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Note 12. Subsequent Events  

Management has evaluated all activity
and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in these financial statements or disclosure
in the notes to these financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion should
be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Quarterly
Report ), including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related notes. References in this Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section to  us,   we,   our, 
and similar terms refer to LifeApps Brands Inc., a Delaware corporation. This discussion includes forward-looking statements,

Overview   

LifeApps Brands Inc. is an emerging
growth company and developer and designer of applications, medical and fitness products, new media, digital magazines, publications,
and next-generation social networks for sports, health, fitness and entertainment enthusiasts. We have a multimarket revenue strategy
that incorporates mobile apps, digital magazines, publications, fitness training devices, web, social media and internet TV to
engage consumers in multiple areas of sports, health, fitness and entertainment interests including medical, yoga, golf, tennis,
running, soccer, cycling, and other health, fitness and sports topics. Although we have determined to shift our business focus
to the medical, health and wellness sectors, we expect that our mobile apps will continue to be represented on the Apple App Store
and our MD Workout  mobile app will continue to be represented in the IMS Health App Script program. 

LifeApps  is a licensed developer
and publisher of apps for the Apple App Store for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini. LifeApps  is also a licensed developer
on both Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android. LifeApps  has distributed apps/publications on all three platforms. Moving
forward, LifeApps  is developing new apps, and exploring new opportunities pairing apps with physical retail and e-commerce/mobile-commerce
products. 

16   

Plan of Operation   

LifeApps  is aggressively pushing
forward on a strategy for utilizing mobile applications related to healthcare with the LifeApps Health initiative. LifeApps Health,
building on the success of the LifeApps MDWorkout  mobile app platform, will bring together consumer mHealth lifestyle products,
like-minded medical health organizations and medically based health and fitness research organizations to create apps. The convergence
of consumer apps with medical programs and clinical research is an exciting milestone in the mHealth marketplace. LifeApps 
believes that its unique position as an established market participant in providing medically based mHealth fitness lifestyle
apps will make LifeApps Health the desired partner for medical organizations who are looking for guidance, app development and
distribution into the mHealth marketplace. We believe that we will drive revenues by targeting sports, health and fitness specific
communities and developing a relationship with their participants, delivering lifestyle content, social networking, skills and
drills training, consumer fitness devices and nutritional content across multiple platforms including, but not limited to, Apple
iOS and Google Android systems. LifeApps  plans to invest in these sports, health and fitness communities through partnerships
with trusted medical organizations, increasing brand awareness and delivering digital content of interest and digitally enhanced
physical consumer products that enrich and improve the user s sports, health and fitness lifestyle. We intend to decrease
our activities related to our Sports One digital platform due to slowing sales and increased competition as we position ourselves
for new opportunities. At the same time, we intend to focus on merger and acquisition candidates in the medical, health and wellness
sectors and/or try to develop innovative products related to these sectors internally. 

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates  

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), which contemplates our continuation
as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, we have incurred losses of $2,701,003. To date we have funded our operations through
advances from a related party, issuance of convertible debt, and the sale of our common stock. We intend to raise additional funding
through third party equity or debt financing. There is no certainty that funding will be available as needed. These factors raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue operating as a going concern. Our ability to continue our operations as a going
concern, realize the carrying value of our assets, and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent
upon our ability to raise capital sufficient to fund our commitments and ongoing losses, and ultimately generate profitable operations. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Fair Value Measurements:   

ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which
are required about fair value measurements. Specifically, ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy
prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted prices are available
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included in
Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Level 2   Pricing inputs are
other than quoted prices in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types
of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, or priced with
models using highly observable inputs. 

Level 3   Significant inputs
to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with
inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine
the fair value of financial transmission rights. 

17   

Our financial instruments consist of
cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables, accruals and convertible notes payable. The
carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables, and accruals approximate
fair value because of the short term maturities of these instruments. 

Inventory  

Inventory consists of finished goods,
sports and fitness products, and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a first-in
first-out basis. 

Intangibles  

Intangibles, which include websites
and databases acquired, internet domain name costs, and customer lists, are being amortized over the expected useful lives which
we estimate to be three to five years. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ), Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 350 Intangibles   Goodwill and Other ( ASC 350 ), the costs
to obtain and register internet domain names were capitalized. 

Derivative Financial Instruments:

We do not use derivative instruments
to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if
such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments
that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued
at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial
instruments, we used a Black Scholes valuation model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation
dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as
equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current
or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months
of the balance sheet date. 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue is derived primarily from the
sale of sports and fitness apparel and equipment, and software applications designed for use on mobile devices such as smart phones
and tablets. Revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, the
product or service has been delivered, and collectability is probable. 

We sell our software directly via Internet
download through third party agents. We recognize revenue when payment is received from the agent. Payment is received net of
commission paid to the agent, usually 70% to us and 30% to the agent. We record the net amount received as revenue. 

We also publish and sell digital magazines
through the internet. Magazines can be purchased as individual volumes or as a subscription. To date we have not had any subscription
sales. 

Cost of Revenue  

Cost of revenue includes the cost of
amounts paid for articles, photography, editorial and production cost of the magazine and ongoing web hosting costs. Cost of revenue
related to product sales includes the direct cost of those products sold. 

18   

Equity Based Payments  

Equity based payments are accounted
for in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. The compensation cost is based upon fair value
of the equity instrument at the date grant. The fair value has been estimated using the Black-Sholes option pricing model. 

Results of Operations  

Three months ended September
30, 2016 compared with the respective period ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues for the three months ended
September, 2016 and 2015 were $147 and $19,260, respectively. Revenues for both periods were derived primarily from the sale of
sports apparel and health and fitness products. The decrease in revenues is due to an across the board downturn in our business. 

Cost of revenue normally includes our
cost of products sold and amounts paid for articles, photography, editorial and production cost of the magazine. In the future
we will incur direct cost related to revenue such as webhosting and direct cost for our customer support. For the foreseeable
future we anticipate outsourcing such costs. Cost of revenue related to product sales includes the direct cost of those products
sold. 

Cost of revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $51 (34.8%) and $26,411 (137.1%), respectively. This resulted in a gross profit (loss) for
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $96 (62.5%) and $(7,151) (-37.1%), respectively. Costs were primarily the cost
of products sold. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to product mix. 

We had net losses of $56,799 and $137,384
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The following is a breakdown of our
selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Costs for personnel, professional fees,
marketing and rent did not vary significantly during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Stock related expenses during the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 are related to the vesting of stock options during the quarter. These expenses are expected to continue
quarterly over a four-year period. 

Other expenses decreased by $3,128
(136.4%) as a result of decreased business activity. These expenses include bank and credit card charges, web hosting and general
business services. 

Expenses for the quarter ended September
30, 2015 also included a charge of $63,462 related to the conversion of related party loans into shares of our common stock. 

19   

We had operating losses of $56,799
and $73,351 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared with the respective period ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $11,168 and $129,262 respectively. Revenues for both periods were derived primarily from the
sale of sports apparel and health and fitness products. The decrease in revenues is due to an across the board downturn in our
business. 

Cost of revenue normally includes our
cost of products sold and amounts paid for articles, photography, editorial and production cost of the magazine. In the future
we will incur direct cost related to revenue such as webhosting and direct cost for our customer support. For the foreseeable
future we anticipate outsourcing such costs. Cost of revenue related to product sales includes the direct cost of those products
sold. 

Cost of revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $8,122 (72.7%) and $106,485 (82.4%) respectively. This resulted in a gross profit for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $3,046 (27.3%) and $22,777 (17.6%), respectively. Costs were primarily the cost
of products sold and the margin varies depending on products sold has been sold. The decrease in gross margin is primarily to
product mix. 

We had net losses of $178,247 and $590,407
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The following is a breakdown of our
selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Personnel costs decreased $17,549 (15.5%)
from $130,770 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $113,221 for the nine months ended September30, 2016. The decrease
is a result of decreases in our number of employees from four in 2015 to one (our CEO) in 2016. 

Professional fees decreased $24,134
(78%) from $55,064 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $30,930 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease
is a result of decreases in our cost of SEC compliance and decreased activity that required legal counsel. 

Marketing and advertising expenses
decreased $23,696 (1,250.4%) from $25,591 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,895 for the nine months ended September30,
2016. The decrease is a result of changes in our business strategy by focusing less effort on product sales. Also, the nine-month
period of 2015 included trade show expenses that have not recurred. 

Research and development includes website
and applications development costs. Research and development expenses decreased $7,597 (3,798.5%) from $7,797 for 2015 to $200
for 2016. We made no major changes to our applications in 2016 whereas in 2015 we updated most of our applications. Development
is an ongoing cost and we anticipate that our development costs both for website and applications may increase in future periods. 

20   

Travel and entertainment decreased
$1,500 from $1,500 in 2015 to $0 in 2016. 

All of our other operating costs decreased
as result of generally keeping cost down. 

We had operating losses of $178,247
and $261,119 for 2016 and 2015 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

We value the derivative liability and
the end of each accounting period the difference in value is recognized as gain or loss. We recognized $189,660 of loss for the
change in value of the derivative for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We had no derivative liabilities in the first
nine months of 2016. In addition, we had losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $110,692 on conversion of debt
due to officers, directors and shareholders of the Company. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We were financed primarily by capital
contributions from members of LifeApps LLC, the predecessor to LifeApps, from short term borrowings, and through our private placement
which we completed in October 2012. Our existing sources of liquidity may not be sufficient for us to implement our initial business
plan. Our need for future capital will be dependent upon the speed at which we expand our product offerings. There are no assurances
that we will be able raise additional capital as needed. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had negative
working capital of $(608,696) as compared to $(450,517) at December 31, 2015. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, operations used cash of $54,918 and $87,324 respectively. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we used no cash in investing activities. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $52,485 and $72,750, respectively. 

Additionally, we received or (repaid)
net amounts of $2,350 and $24,750 of cash advances from our chief executive officer and net amounts of $52,135 and $48,000 of
cash advances from a director and a shareholder during the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Also during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 our chief executive officer converted $31,250 of cash advances into 1,666,667 shares
of common stock at a conversion rate based on the trading value of our common stock during a predetermined period. 

We will continue to seek out additional
capital in the form of debt or equity under the most favorable terms we can find. 

Going Concern  

Our financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the
normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We have incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit
of approximately $2,701,003 as of September 30, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of our business raising
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
our generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay
our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over
the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and/or additional officer and shareholder advances. These financials do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications
of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. 

21   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We are a smaller reporting company
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) and are
not required to provide the information required under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures  

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of
the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial
Officer ( CFO ) (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective , due to a lack of audit committee and segregation of duties caused by limited
personnel, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits
under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s
CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Limitations on Effectiveness of
Controls and Procedures  

Our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), does not expect that
our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because
of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Management believes that the material
weakness set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. 

22   

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting  

There have been no changes in the Company's
internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED
SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

of common stock to our corporate /securities counsel in consideration of their agreement to temporarily defer payment of legal
fees due to it for services rendered. 

On October 27, 2016 we issued 4,545,455
shares of our common stock to a lender in connection with the conversion of $25,000 in loan principal and the waiver of accrued
interest due thereon. 

The forgoing issuances were made in
reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

ITEM 5.
OTHER INFORMATION  

On October 27, 2016 we entered into
a Debt Conversion Agreement with an individual lender pursuant to which the lender converted the $25,000 principal amount of a
November 9, 2015 loan into 4,545,455 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of $0.0055 per share which was the closing
price for our common stock on October 27, 2016. At that time, the Lender waived the accrued interest due on the loan. 

On April 5, 2016 we received a $15,000
loan from an individual lender, the repayment terms for which had never been reduced to writing. On October 27, 2016 we evidenced
