CHINA LONGYI GROUP INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED  Notes to
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements September 30,
2016   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) for financial information
and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by US GAAP for annual financial statements. These unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary
for a fair presentation have been included. The unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements of China Longyi Group International Holdings
Limited (the  Company  or  China Longyi ) include the accounts of China Longyi
and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  1.         
  BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND ORGANIZATION   
 We are a holding company that only
operates through our indirect Chinese subsidiaries Beijing SOD and Chongqing
SOD. Through our Chinese subsidiaries, we develop, manufacture and market our
SOD products in China. SOD is a naturally occurring enzyme which may act as a
potent antioxidant defense in cells that are exposed to oxygen.  
 The following chart reflects our
organizational structure as of the date of this report.

1.   
     
        BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND ORGANIZATION
      (Continued)    

CONTROL BY PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS   

The directors, executive officers, affiliates and related
      parties own, beneficially and in the aggregate, the majority of the voting
      power of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company.
      Accordingly, if they voted their shares uniformly, directors, executive
      officers and affiliates would have the ability to control the approval of
      most corporate actions, including increasing the authorized capital stock
      of China Longyi and the dissolution, merger or sale of the Company's
      assets.   

GOING CONCERN   

The Company has earned only insignificant revenues since
      its inception. As at September 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital
      deficiency of $1,167,729 and accumulated deficit from recurring net losses
      of $30,731,204 incurred for the current and prior years as of September
      30, 2016. As at September 30, 2016, the Company has cash and cash
      equivalents of $152,912.   

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern
      ultimately is dependent on the management s ability to obtain equity or
      debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, and achieve
      profitable operations. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim
      financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
      recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and
      classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
      not be able to continue as a going concern.   

2.   
     
        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
  POLICIES    

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION   

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
      statements for all periods presented include the financial statements of
      China Longyi Group International Holdings Limited, and its subsidiaries:
      Top Team Holdings Limited, Full Ample Group Limited (Daykeen Group, BVI),
      Top Time International Limited (HK), Beijing SOD, and Chongqing SOD. The
      unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been
      prepared in accordance with US GAAP. All significant intercompany accounts
      and transactions have been eliminated.   

The Company has determined the People s Republic of China
      Chinese Yuan Renminbi ( RMB ) to be its functional currency. The
      accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements
      are presented in United States (US) dollars. The unaudited condensed
      consolidated interim financial statements are translated into US dollars
      from RMB at quarter-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and
      weighted average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Capital
      accounts are translated at their historical exchange rates when the
      capital transactions occurred.   

RMB is not freely convertible into the currency of other
      nations. All such exchange transactions must take place through authorized
      institutions. There is no guarantee the RMB amounts could have been, or
      could be, converted into US dollars at rates used in
  translation.

2.   
     
        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
      (Continued)    

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN SUBSIDIARIES   

The Company owns 90% of the equity interests in Beijing
      SOD, and the remaining 10% is owned by Miss Ran Wang. Therefore, the
      Company records non-controlling interest charge in the statement of
      operations to allocate 10% of the results of operations of the Beijing SOD
      to Miss Ran Wang, its non-controlling shareholder.   

The Company owns 81% of the equity interest in Chongqing
      SOD of which 9% is owned by Miss Ran Wang, and the remaining 10% by Mr.
      Guoqing Tan. Therefore, the Company records non-controlling interest
      charge in the statement of operations to allocate 19% of the results of
      operations of Chongqing SOD to its non-controlling shareholders.   

USE OF ESTIMATES   

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
      with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
      affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
      contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
      and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
      Actual results could differ from those estimates.   

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES   

Several areas require significant management estimates
      relating to uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible that there
      will be a material change in the near term. The more significant areas
      requiring the use of management estimates related to determination of net
      realizable value of inventory, allowance for doubtful accounts, property
      and equipment, accrued liabilities, and the useful lives for
      depreciation.   

REVENUE RECOGNITION   

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
      arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, delivery has
      occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales
      proceeds. The Company generally obtains purchase authorizations from its
      customers for a specified amount of products at a specified price and
      considers delivery to have occurred when the customer takes title of the
      products.   

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT   

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
      Significant additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and
      maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Equipment purchased for
      specific research and development projects with no alternative uses are
      expensed. Assets under construction are not depreciated until construction
      is completed and the assets are ready for their intended use. Gains and
      losses from the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recorded in
      loss on disposal and impairment of property, plant and equipment included
      in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).   

Depreciation and amortization are provided for financial
      reporting purposes primarily on the straight-line method over the
      estimated useful lives of the respective assets as
  follows:     

Estimated   

Useful Life   
   
     Transportation equipment  
     5 years   
   
     Furniture and office equipment

     Production equipment  
     10 years   
   
     Building and improvements  
     20 years

        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
      (Continued)    

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS   

Cash and Cash Equivalents as of September 30, 2016 were
      $152,912 and $29,429 in December 31, 2015.   

INVENTORY   

Prior to January 1, 2015, inventories are stated at the
      lower of cost or replacement cost with respect to raw materials and the
      lower of cost or market with respect to finished goods and work in
      progress. The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued
      Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-11 ( ASU 2015-11 ),
      Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which the Company adopted on
      January 1, 2015. Subsequent to January 1, 2015, inventories are stated at
      the lower of cost or replacement cost with respect to raw materials and
      the lower of cost or net realizable value with respect to finished goods
      and work in progress. The cost of work in progress and finished goods is
      determined on a weighted average cost basis and includes direct material,
      direct labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value represents the
      anticipated selling price, net of distribution cost, less estimated costs
      to completion for work in progress.   

Inventories as of September 30, 2016 were $333,210 and
      $359,194 in December 31, 2015.   

INCOME TAXES   

Income tax expense is based on reported income before
      income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary
      differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for
      financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for
      income tax purposes. In accordance with ASC Topic 740 (formerly SFAS No.
      109,  Accounting for income taxes ) these deferred taxes are measured by
      applying currently enacted tax laws.   

The Company did not provide any current or deferred
      income tax provision or benefit for any period presented to date because
      it has experienced operating losses since inception. The benefit of any
      tax income (loss) carry forwards is fully offset by a valuation allowance,
      as there is a more than fifty percent chance that the Company will not
      realize those benefits.   

There are net operating loss carry forwards allowed under
      the Hong Kong and China Governments  tax system.

        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
      (Continued)    

SHIPPING AND HANDLING   

Costs relating to shipping and handling are part of
      general and administrative expenses in the unaudited consolidated
      statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Insignificant amount of
      shipping and handling costs incurred during the nine months ended
      September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

EARNING (LOSS) PER SHARE   

Basic earnings (loss) per common share ("LPS") is
      calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of
      common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per
      common share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding
      shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock
    options.   

There were no stock options and potentially dilutive
      securities outstanding as at September 30, 2016.   

STOCK - BASED COMPENSATION   

Compensation expense for costs related to all share-based
      payments, including grants of stock options, is recognized through a
      fair-value based method. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing
      model to determine the grant date fair value for stock options. The
      Company uses the grant date stock price to determine the grant date fair
      value of restricted shares. The Company has elected to recognize
      share-based compensation costs using the straight-line method over the
      requisite service period with a graded vesting schedule, provided that the
      amount of compensation costs recognized at any date is at least equal to
      the portion of the grant date value of the awards that are vested at that
      date. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
      necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial
      estimates. Share based compensation costs are recorded net of estimated
      forfeitures such that expense is recorded only for those awards that are
      expected to vest.   

The Company had no such compensation expense for the nine
      months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

COMPARATIVE FIGURES   

Certain comparative figures have been reclassified in
      order to conform with the presentation adopted in the current
    period.   

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)   

The Company s comprehensive income (loss) consists of net
      income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments.   

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDDARDS   

There were no changes to the new accounting
      pronouncements as described in our Annual Report on Form 10- K for the
      fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 except for the
  following:

CHINA LONGYI GROUP INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED  Notes to
condensed consolidated financial statements (Unaudited)  September 30, 2016

2.   
     
        SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
      (Continued)    

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
      Board ("FASB") issued guidance which amends the existing accounting
      standards for leases. Consistent with existing guidance, the recognition,
      measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a
      lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification. Under the
      new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize right-of-use assets
      and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective
      for us from November 1, 2020, and interim periods in the following year.
      Early adoption of this guidance is permitted and we will be required to
      adopt using a modified retrospective approach. We are evaluating the
      timing and the impact of adopting this guidance on our unaudited condensed
      consolidated financial statements and disclosures.   

In January 2016, FASB issued amendments to address
      certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure
      of financial instruments. The standard requires entities to measure equity
      investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for
      under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair
      value in net income. The provisions under this amendment are effective for
      us from November 1, 2018, and for interim periods in the following year
      and early adoption is not permitted. We are evaluating the impact of
      adopting this guidance to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
      statements.   

In November 2015, FASB issued guidance intended to
      simplify accounting for deferred taxes. Beginning on November 1, 2017 and
      including the interim periods following that date, we will be required to
      present all deferred tax balances as non-current. Existing GAAP guidance
      requires us to record deferred tax balances as either current or
      non-current in accordance with the classification of the underlying
      attributes. Early adoption of this guidance is permitted and may be
      applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented.
      We expect to early adopt this guidance prospectively at the end of the
      second quarter of fiscal year 2016, but we are still evaluating how
      significant the impact of the adoption will be on our consolidated balance
      sheet.   

Other amendments to GAAP in the U.S. that have been
      issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require
      adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on
      our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements upon
      adoption.

        STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY    

The Company's capital structure as of September 30, 2016
      and December 31, 2015 was as follows:     

As of September 30, 2016, the Company
had accumulated deficit of $30,731,204.

        INVESTMENT    

On January 5, 2010, the Company acquired 20% equity
      interest in Cangshan Duoha Vegetable Food Company ( Duoha ) by issuing

  Overview of our Business   
 We are a holding company that only operates through our
indirect Chinese subsidiaries Beijing SOD and Chongqing SOD. Through our Chinese
subsidiaries, we develop, manufacture and market our SOD products in China. SOD
is a naturally occurring enzyme which may act as a potent antioxidant defense in
cells that are exposed to oxygen. Certain research has shown that under certain
biological conditions, SOD revitalizes cells and reduces the rate of cell
destruction. It neutralizes the most common free radical superoxide radical by
converting it into hydrogen peroxide and water. Because superoxide is harmful to
human cells, and certain forms of SOD exist naturally in most humans, many
studies show that SOD is valuable in protecting human cells from the harmful
effects of superoxide. SOD is thought to be more powerful than antioxidant
vitamins as it activates the body's productions of its own antioxidants. As a result, SOD is referred to as the  enzyme of
life.  Commercially, SOD has a wide range of applications and is widely applied
in foods, drinks, skin care productions, pharmaceuticals, to combat ailments
ranging from sunburn to rheumatoid arthritis.

Third Quarter of 2016 Financial Performance
Highlights   
 The following are some financial highlights for the three
months ended September 30, 2016:  

Revenue : Revenue increase $880,247, to $1,034,223 for the three
  months ended September 30, 2016, from $153,976 for the same period in 2015.

Expense from operations : Expense from operations increased $179,525,
  or 147.59%, to $301,162 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from
  $121,637 for the same period in 2015.  
   
    Net profit : Net profit increased $225,267, or 1349.06%, to $241,965
  for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $16,698 for the same
  period in 2015.  
   
    Fully diluted net income per share : Fully diluted net income per
  share was $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0
  for the same period in 2015.    
   Provision for Income Taxes    

United States : China Longyi Group International Holding Limited is
  subject to United States tax at a tax rate of 34%. No provision for income
  taxes in the United States has been made as China Longyi Group International
  Holding Limited had no income subject to United States taxation in the third
  quarter of 2016.  
   
    British Virgin Islands : Our wholly owned subsidiary Top Team
  Holdings Limited was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, or the BVI,
  and, under the current laws of the BVI, is not subject to income taxes.  
   
    China : Before the implementation of the enterprise income tax, or
  EIT, Foreign Invested Enterprises or FIEs, established in the PRC were
  generally subject to an EIT rate of 33.0%, which includes a 30.0% state income
  tax and a 3.0% local income tax. On March 16, 2007, the National People s
  Congress of China passed the new Corporate Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and on
  November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed the Implementing Rules
  for the EIT Law, or Implementing Rules, which took effect on January 1, 2008.
  The EIT Law and Implementing Rules impose a unified EIT of 25.0% on all
  domestic- invested enterprises and FIEs, unless they qualify under certain
  limited exceptions. Therefore, nearly all FIEs are subject to the new tax rate
  alongside other domestic businesses rather than benefiting from the old tax
  laws applicable to FIEs, and its associated preferential tax treatments,
  beginning January 1, 2008.  Despite these pending changes, the EIT Law
  gives the FIEs established before March 16, 2007, or Old FIEs, such as our
  subsidiaries Beijing SOD and Chongqing SOD, a five-year grandfather period
  during which they can continue to enjoy their existing preferential tax
  treatments. During this five-year grandfather period, the Old FIEs which
  enjoyed tax rates lower than 25% under the original EIT Law shall gradually
  increase their EIT rate by 2% per year until the tax rate reaches 25%. In
  addition, the Old FIEs that are eligible for the  two-year exemption and
  three-year half reduction  or  five-year exemption and five-year
  half-reduction  under the original EIT Law, are allowed to remain to enjoy
  their preference until these holidays expire. The discontinuation of any such
  special or preferential tax treatment or other incentives would have an
  adverse effect on any organization s business, fiscal condition and current
  operations in China.  In addition to the changes to the current tax
  structure, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with
   de facto management bodies  within China is considered a resident enterprise
  and will  normally be subject to a EIT of 25.0%
on its global income. The Implementing Rules define the term  de facto
management bodies  as  an establishment that exercises, in substance, overall
management and control over the production, business, personnel, accounting,
etc., of a Chinese enterprise.  If the PRC tax authorities subsequently
determine that we should be classified as a resident enterprise, then our
consolidated global income will be subject to PRC income tax of 25.0% .

We incurred no income taxes in either the three months ended
September 30, 2016 or the three months ended September 30, 2015.

the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $26,547 from $169,667

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 We had $152,912 in cash and cash equivalents as of September
30, 2016. As of such date, we also had total current assets of $851,334 and
total assets of $1,231,699. We had total current liabilities (consisting of
accounts payable, accrued liabilities, due to directors and other payables) in
the amount of $2,019,063. Our stockholders  equity as of September 30, 2016 was
$(787,364). Since inception, we have accumulated a net loss of $30,731,204.  
 The following table summarizes the statements of cash flows
from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015:  
 
  Operating Activities   
 Net cash provided by operating activities was $202,802 for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 representing an increase of $150,515
from $52,287 of net cash provided by the operating activities for the same
period of 2015. The increase in the cash provided by operating activities was
mainly attributable to changes in Net income, Account receivables, Deposits and
prepayment, and other payables. Cash flows provided by Net Income increased
$523,369 to $305,335 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from
($218,034) for the same period in 2015. Cash flow used in Account receivables
increased $173,029 to $173,029 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
from $0 for the same period in 2015. Cash flows used in Deposits and prepayment
increased $81,765, to $90,864 for nine months ended September 30, 2016, from
$9,099 for the same period in 2015. Cash flow provided by other payables
decreased $74,938, to $203,929 for nine months ended September 30, 2016, from
$278,867 for the same period in 2015.  
  Investing Activities   
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016 was $6,335 as compared with $67,219 of net cash used in
investing activities for the same period of 2015. We did not have any investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the
same period of 2015. 
  Financing Activities   
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016 was $81,674 as compared to $6,479 used in financing
activities for the same period in 2015. We repaid certain short term loans and
loans from directors in an amount of $57,788 and $23,886, respectively, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 The Company did not have any bank loans as of September 30,
2016. 
 18  

We expect to generate approximately $2 million to $2.5 million
of revenues from the sale of our products during the next 12 months. If our cash on hand and cash flow from
operations do not meet our expected capital expenditure and working capital
requirements for the next 12 months, we expect that our directors will provide
more cash as loans to the company. However, we may in the future require
additional cash resources due to changed business conditions, implementation of
our strategy to expand our production capacity or other investments or
acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our own financial resources are
insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional
equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of
additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The
incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations
and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would
restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms
acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on
terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our business
operations and could harm our overall business prospects. 
  Critical Accounting Policies   
  Foreign Currencies   The company has determined that
RMB to be its functional currency. The accompanying unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. The unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements are translated into US
dollars from RMB at period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and
weighted average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Capital accounts are
translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions
occurred.  

Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  
 Several areas require significant management estimates relating
to uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible that there will be a
material change in the near term. The more significant areas requiring the use
of management estimates related to determination of net realizable value of
inventory, allowance for doubtful accounts, property and equipment, accrued
liabilities and, the useful lives for depreciation.  
  Revenue Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue
in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.104  Revenue recognition  ( ASC
Topic 605 ). Revenues are recognized as earned when the following four criteria
are met: (1) a customer issues purchase orders or otherwise agrees to purchase
products; (2) products are delivered to the customer; (3) pricing is fixed or
determined in accordance with the purchase order or agreement; and (4)
collectability is reasonably assured.  
 19  

Inflation   
 Inflation does not materially affect our business or the
results of our operations.  
  Seasonality   
 We may experience seasonal variations in our future revenues
and our operating costs, however, we do not believe that these variations will
be material. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to investors.  
  ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK   
 Not Applicable.  
  ITEMS 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   Disclosure Controls and Procedures     
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, Ms. Jie Chen and Mr. Xinmin Pan,
respectively, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by a company in the reports, such as this report, that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on that evaluation, Ms. Jie Chen and Mr. Xinmin Pan concluded that as of
September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level.    
   Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting    
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation performed that occurred during the fiscal quarter
covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
