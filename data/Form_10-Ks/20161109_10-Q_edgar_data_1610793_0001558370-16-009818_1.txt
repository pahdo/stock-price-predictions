1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Description of Business 

State National Companies, Inc. (the  Company ) refers to a group of companies that conducts insurance-related activities along two major segments.  The Company s Program Services segment generates fee income, in the form of ceding fees, by offering issuing carrier capacity to both specialty general agents and other producers ( GAs ), who sell, control, and administer books of insurance business that are supported by third parties that assume reinsurance risk.  Substantially all of the underwriting risk associated with the Program Services segment is ceded to unaffiliated, highly rated reinsurance companies or other reinsurers that provide collateral.  The Company s Lender Services segment generates premiums primarily from the sale of collateral protection insurance ( CPI ), which insures automobiles or other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions, banks and specialty finance companies. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Company includes the results of operations of an acquired business in its consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. 

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial reporting.  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

The interim financial data as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 is unaudited.  However, in the opinion of the Company s management ( Management ), the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly state the results for the interim period.  The results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. 

Refer to  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 for information on accounting policies that we consider critical in preparing consolidated financial statements. 

Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 

Earnings Per Share 

The computation of earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the effect of common shares potentially issuable (in periods in which they have a dilutive effect).

Table of Contents  

Income Taxes 

For any uncertain tax positions not meeting the  more likely than not  recognition threshold, accounting standards require recognition, measurement, and disclosure in the financial statements.  There were no uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Stock-based Compensation 

Compensation expense for stock-based payments is recognized based on the measurement-date fair value for awards that will settle in shares.  Compensation expense for restricted stock grants and stock option awards that contain a service condition are recognized on a straight line pro rata basis over the vesting period.  For restricted stock awards that contain a performance condition, the expense is recognized based on the awards expected to vest and the cumulative expense is adjusted whenever the estimate of the number of awards to vest changes.  See Note 7    Stock-based Payments  for related disclosures. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2014-09),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606).  The core guidance of the ASU presents a comprehensive revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  The ASU provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized and requires additional disclosures sufficient to describe the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows for these transactions.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to defer the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that period.  Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  As insurance contracts are excluded from this ASU, the Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, this ASU will have on financial results and disclosures and which adoption method to apply. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2015-03),  Interest   Imputation of Interest  (Topic 835).  The new guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The guidance in ASU 2015-03 does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.  The FASB therefore issued ASU 2015-15  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  which clarified that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  For public business entities, the guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016. 

In May 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2015-09),  Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts  (Topic 944) intended to make targeted improvements to disclosure requirements for insurance companies that issue short-duration contracts.  The amendments in this update are expected to increase transparency of significant estimates made in measuring those liabilities, improve comparability by requiring consistent disclosure of information, and provide financial statement users with additional information to facilitate analysis of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from contracts issued by insurance entities and the development of loss reserve estimates.  This ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating what impact this ASU will have on disclosures. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2015-16),  Business Combinations - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  (Topic 805) which applies to all entities that have   

8 

Table of Contents  

reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this update require that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this update require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The only disclosures required at transition will be the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle. An entity should disclose that information in the first annual period of adoption and in the interim periods within the first annual period if there is a measurement-period adjustment during the first annual period in which the changes are effective. The Company adopted the provisions of this ASU on January 1, 2016.  

In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2016-01),  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  (Sub-Topic 825-10).  The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income.  The amendments are expected to improve financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entity s equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income.  This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating what impact this ASU will have on financial results and disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2016-02),  Leases  (Topic 842) that requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements.  The FASB is issuing this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not plan to early adopt and is currently evaluating what impact this ASU will have on financial results and disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2016-08),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).   The new standard requires an entity to determine whether it is a principal or an agent in a transaction in which another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer by evaluating the nature of its promise to the customer.  An entity is a principal and therefore records revenue on a gross basis if it controls the promised good or service before transferring the good or service to the customer.  An entity is an agent and records as revenue the net amount it retains for its agency services if its role is to arrange for another entity to provide the goods or services.  The amendments clarify how an entity should identify the unit of accounting for the principal versus agent evaluation, and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements, such as service transactions, by explaining what a principal controls before the specified good or service is transferred to the customer.  This ASU s effective date and transition requirements are the same as those of the new revenue recognition standard which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that period.  The Company is currently evaluating what impact, if any, this ASU will have on financial results and disclosures. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2016-09),  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   Under the new guidance, companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in capital (APIC).  Instead, companies will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, and APIC pools will be eliminated.  For interim reporting purposes, companies will account for excess tax benefits and tax   

9 

Table of Contents  

deficiencies as discrete items in the period in which they occur.  In addition, the guidance eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them.  The guidance requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity.  This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company prospectively adopted the provisions of this ASU on January 1, 2016 and the impact was immaterial to financial results.  There would have been no impact to prior periods. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2016-12),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.   The amendments clarify that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all (or substantially all) of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy GAAP.  The amendments also clarify how an entity should evaluate the collectibility threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria.  This ASU s effective date and transition requirements are the same as those of the new revenue recognition standard which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that period.  The Company will be evaluating what impact, if any, this ASU will have on financial results and disclosures. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2016-13),  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The standard will replace today s  incurred loss  approach with an  expected loss  model for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances for available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount, as they do today under the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) model. It also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.  This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company will be evaluating what impact this ASU will have on financial results and disclosures.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (ASU 2016-14),  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This ASU amends guidance related to debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and corporate-owned life insurance, distributions received from equity method investees and beneficial interests in securitization transactions.  The guidance will generally be applied retrospectively and is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years.  The Company does not expect financial results and disclosures to be significantly impacted by this ASU. 

Reclassifications 

The Company adopted ASU 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest  on January 1, 2016.  Presentation of  Other Assets  and  Debt, net  on the prior year balance sheet have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of this ASU.  The 2015 presentation of each line was adjusted by $760 thousand to reflect the netting of unamortized debt issuance costs.

2.   Investments 

The following table summarizes information on the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and the fair value of investment securities by class: 

Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market, and credit risk.  Fair values of securities fluctuate based on the magnitude of changing market conditions; significant changes in market conditions could materially affect the portfolio fair value in the near term. 

11 

Table of Contents  

The following tables show the gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position: 

The determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in fair value and the associated amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of Management and a regular review of the Company s investments.  Management reviewed all securities with unrealized losses in accordance with the Company s impairment policy described in Note 1    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.  Management believes that the temporary impairments are primarily the result of widening credit spreads, and that despite the wider credit spreads, the securities are only temporarily impaired due to the strength of the issuing companies  balance sheets, as well as their available liquidity options.  For structured securities, future cash flow projections were used to determine potential impairment. For those securities where cash flow projections showed less than 100% principal recovery, a net present value test was done to determine any credit related losses.  There were 70 securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016.  Over 66% of these investments were investment-grade at September 30, 2016.  We do not intend to sell or believe we will be required to sell any of our temporarily-impaired fixed maturities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.  Management has the intent and ability to hold the equity securities in an unrealized loss position until the recovery of their fair value.    

12 

Table of Contents  

Therefore, Management does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016. 

Proceeds from sales of investments in fixed-maturity, equity and short-term securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $55.1 million and $22.1 million, respectively. 

The Company holds convertible securities with embedded derivatives.  The embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract if all of the following criteria are met: the combined instrument is not accounted for in its entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings; the terms of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract; and a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument.  These embedded derivatives are presented together with the host contract and carried at estimated fair value.  Changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are reflected in  Realized net investment gains  in the condensed consolidated statements of income, while changes in the estimated fair value of the underlying fixed maturity securities are reflected in  Unrealized holding gains (losses)  in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

The following table presents the Company s gross realized gains (losses) for the periods ended September 30: 

The Company had two non-cash exchanges of investment securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and four non-cash exchanges for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Non-cash consideration received for these exchanges was $533 thousand and $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 respectively.  Gains of $153 thousand and $72 thousand were recognized on these exchanges and are reflected in  Realized net investment gains  on the condensed consolidated statements of income.

Table of Contents  

The following schedule details the maturities of the Company s fixed-maturity securities, available-for-sale, as of September 30, 2016: 

Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

The Company s investment portfolio includes $0.9 million of mortgage-backed securities collateralized by subprime residential loans, which represent approximately 0.26% of the Company s total investments as of September 30, 2016.  The Company does not own mortgage derivatives. 

Net investment income for the periods ended September 30, consists of the following: 

The Company s insurance subsidiaries, State National Insurance Company, Inc. ( SNIC ), National Specialty Insurance Company ( NSIC ), United Specialty Insurance Company ( USIC ) and United National Specialty Insurance Company ( UNSIC ) are required to maintain deposits in various states where they are licensed to operate.  These deposits consisted of fixed-maturity securities at fair values totaling $76.9 million and $53.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

3. Income Tax Provision 

The Company computes its provision for income taxes in interim periods by applying its estimated annual effective tax rate against income (loss) before income taxes for the period.  In addition, non-recurring or discrete items are recorded during the period in which they occur.  The magnitude of the impact that discrete items have on the Company s quarterly effective tax rate is dependent on the level of income in the period.  A reconciliation of federal income tax expense computed by applying the federal statutory tax rate to income (loss) before income taxes for the nine month periods ended September 30 is as follows: 

4. Reinsurance 

Through unaffiliated general agents, the Company s insurance subsidiaries write property and casualty lines of business in the Program Services segment.  This business is written and reinsured pursuant to quota share and excess of loss reinsurance contracts and general agency agreements that are tripartite agreements executed by the Company s insurance subsidiaries, the reinsurer, and the general agent.  Substantially all of the underwriting risk associated with this business is borne by the reinsurer.  As compensation for writing this business, the Company s insurance subsidiaries receive ceding fees from the producers and, accordingly, the related ceding fees receivable are reflected as accounts receivable from agents.  In most instances, if the producer defaults on its obligation to pay these fees (or any other amount due), the reinsurer is obligated to make the payment under the guarantee contained in the contracts. 

Certain insurance subsidiaries write business in the Lender Services segment through an affiliated general agent.  The Company is party to a reinsurance agreement in which it cedes 30% of certain CPI policies to CUMIS Insurance Society, Inc. ( CUNA Mutual ) and receives a ceding commission related to these policies. 

The Company earns minimum ceding fees on certain programs based on estimates of annual premiums to be written for those programs that are subject to minimum premium levels and related ceding fees.    The Company re-estimated its 2015 annual projection for such programs during the third quarter 2015, which resulted in an additional $1.9 million of minimum ceding fees earned for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015.  The Company re-estimated its 2016 annual projection for such programs during the third quarter 2016, which resulted in an additional $0.6 million of minimum ceding fees earned for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016.

The Company s insurance subsidiaries remain liable for unearned premiums and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reinsurance ceded should the reinsurer be unable to meet its obligations.  Management considers the possibility of a reinsurer becoming unable to meet its obligations as remote due to the reinsurers  financial stability, A.M. Best Company rating, size, security funds available, and other factors as appropriate.  Following is a summary of these balances: 

The fair value of all collateral held by the Company s insurance subsidiaries for reinsurers for whom we require collateral is approximately 135% of the related reinsurance recoverables as of September 30, 2016, with the lowest ratio for any such reinsurer being 103%. 

5. Fair Value Measurements 

Assets and liabilities reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements at fair value are required to be classified according to a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation methodologies into three levels.  The hierarchy gives the highest ranking to fair values determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest ranking to fair values determined using methodologies and models with unobservable inputs (Level 3).  An asset s or liability s classification is based on the lowest level input that is significant to its measurement.  For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable (Level 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3).  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date.     

Level 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices from those willing to trade in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data for the term of the instrument.  These inputs include market interest rates and volatilities, spreads, and yield curves.     

Level 3: Inputs are unobservable.  Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.     

A description of the Company s valuation techniques used to measure its assets at fair value is as follows: 

Available-for-sale, fixed-maturity securities: All fixed-maturity investments are currently reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs.  For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from either an independent pricing service using quoted prices or from its third-party investment managers.  These Level 2 inputs are valued by either the pricing service or the investment managers utilizing observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus, prepayment speeds, credit information, and the security s terms and conditions, among other things.     

Available-for-sale equity securities: Equity securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service using quoted prices or from its third-party investment managers. These Level 2 inputs are valued by either the pricing

service or the investment managers utilizing observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus, prepayment speeds, credit information, and the security s terms and conditions, among other things.     

Embedded derivatives: The Company invests in convertible securities that have embedded derivatives. Embedded derivatives are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value reported in the consolidated statements of net income. The estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives is calculated by the Company s third-party investment managers using observable inputs.     

Management has reviewed the processes used by the pricing services and has determined that they result in fair values consistent with requirements for Level 2 investment securities.  Based on an analysis of the inputs, the Company s investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis have been categorized as follows: 

The fair value of embedded derivatives included in Level 2 securities was $8.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Table of Contents  

There was no Level 3 activity including gains or losses recognized, purchases, or sales transaction during the periods ending September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period.  There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

6. 401(k) Profit-Sharing Plan and Trust 

The Company has a 401(k) profit-sharing plan for employees that covers all officers and employees who are at least 18 years of age.  The Company is required to make a matching contribution of 100% of the first 1% and 50% of the next 5% of employees  contributions.  Also, the Company may make additional matching and profit-sharing contributions that are discretionary and are determined at the end of each plan year.  The employer contribution expense included in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $347 thousand (2015 - $226 thousand) and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.1 million (2015 - $901 thousand). 

7. Stock-based Payments 

On May 29, 2014, the Company s shareholders approved the 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan ( 2014 Plan ), which provides for an aggregate of 4.4 million shares of common stock that may be issued to employees and non-employee directors.  Awards under the 2014 Plan may be in the form of stock options (including incentive stock options that meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and non-statutory stock options), restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and performance units. 

The fair value of the restricted shares granted is determined based on the most recent trading price of the stock as of the grant date.  The fair value of each stock option grant is established on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  There were no options granted during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  The Company granted 575,000 options during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  The following table summarizes the assumptions used to value these options:

The Company monitors the financial stability of these institutions regularly, and Management does not believe there is significant credit risk associated with deposits in excess of federally insured amounts. 

The Company s writings in California, Texas, Florida and New York comprised 57% and 56% of gross premiums written for the periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The four largest reinsurers with unsecured reinsurance recoverables, all of which are rated A or higher by A.M. Best, accounted for approximately 17%, 13%, 7%, and 6% of the Company s unsecured reinsurance recoverables at September 30, 2016. 

9  .    Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings incidental to its normal business activities.  Management of the Company does not anticipate that the outcome of such legal actions will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

The Company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to assessments from various insurance regulatory agencies related to insurance company insolvencies.  Management is not aware of any material assessments for which notice has not yet been received.  However, to the extent that such assessments are made, the Company has the contractual right to recover these amounts from the underlying reinsurers. 

The Company has a Collateral Protection Alliance (the  Alliance ) with CUMIS Insurance Society, Inc., a subsidiary of CUNA Mutual, to administer and write CPI business for CUNA Mutual s customers.  The Alliance includes an agency

12. Common Stock 

On October 12, 2015, the Company announced a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $50 million in shares of the Company's common stock through December 31, 2016. Repurchases are made in accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b-18 and may be made pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased 697,098 shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price including commissions of $7.1 million.  The excess cost of the repurchased shares over par value was charged to retained earnings. 

A summary of common stock repurchases for the period October 1, 2016 through November 9, 2016 (subsequent to September 30, 2016) and for the period ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

13. Debt 

The Company has three statutory business trusts (the  Trusts ) that were formed between 2002 and 2004, for the sole purpose of issuing $44.5 million of trust preferred securities in private offering transactions.  The Trusts used the proceeds from these offerings, together with the equity proceeds received from the Company upon their initial formation to purchase variable-rate subordinated debentures issued by the Company.  All voting securities of the Trusts are owned by the Company, and the debentures are the sole assets of the trusts.  The Trusts meet the obligations of the trust preferred securities with the interest and principal paid on the debentures.  The Company does not have a variable interest in the Trusts and therefore does not consolidate the Trusts.  These debentures  interest rates range from 3.80% to 4.10% plus the 3-month LIBOR.  All of the debentures mature between 2032 and 2034 and are reflected net of debt issuance costs in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

On March 31, 2016, the Company, through its subsidiary T.B.A. Insurance Group, Ltd. ( TBA ), entered into a loan agreement ( credit agreement ), which provides for a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $15 million.  The credit agreement matures on April 30, 2018.  Under the credit agreement, TBA may request advances up to the aggregate amount of the unused commitment under the credit facility, on a revolving basis, prior to the maturity of the credit agreement.  Borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.85% per annum; provided, however, that LIBOR shall be subject to a floor of 0.15%.  TBA shall also pay a commitment fee on the daily average unused commitment amount for the period running from the closing date to the maturity date at a rate of 0.125% per annum.  The credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default, as well as a financial covenant requiring TBA and the Company to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of at least $150 million. TBA s obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the Company and are secured by a securities account in the name of TBA and maintained with the creditor, in which TBA must maintain assets with a market value of at least $25 million.

Overview 

We are a leading specialty provider of property and casualty insurance services operating in two niche markets across the United States.  In our Program Services segment, we leverage our  A  (Excellent) A.M. Best rating, expansive licenses and reputation to provide access to the U.S. property and casualty insurance market in exchange for ceding fees.  In our Lender Services segment, we specialize in providing collateral protection insurance  CPI , which insures personal automobiles and other vehicles held as collateral for loans made by credit unions, banks and specialty finance companies. 

Our Program Services segment generates significant fee income, in the form of ceding fees, by offering issuing carrier ( fronting ) capacity to both specialty general agents and other producers ( GAs ), who sell, control, and administer books of insurance business that are supported by third parties that assume reinsurance risk.  These reinsurers are domestic and foreign insurers and institutional risk investors ( capacity providers ) that want to access specific lines of U.S. property and casualty insurance business.  Issuing carrier arrangements refer to our business in which we write insurance on behalf of a capacity provider and then reinsure the risk under these policies with the capacity provider in exchange for ceding fees.  We reinsure substantially all of the underwriting risks in connection with our fronting arrangements to our capacity providers.  As such, this segment generates very large gross premiums with no net premiums (except for the run-off of the retained business as described below).  In many cases, we hold significant collateral to secure the associated reinsurance recoverables.  Furthermore, to the extent funds related to settling balances

Table of Contents  

(premiums, commissions and losses) between the GAs and the reinsurers are not the obligation of the Company, no receivables or payables are reflected in the Company s financial statements for these amounts.  In exchange for providing our insurance capacity, licensing and rating to our GA and insurer clients, we receive ceding fees averaging in excess of 5% of gross written premiums. 

Our Lender Services segment generates premiums primarily from providing collateral protection insurance or CPI to our credit union, bank and specialty finance company clients.  Lenders purchase CPI to provide coverage for automobiles or other vehicles of borrowers who do not uphold their obligation to insure the collateral underlying the loan.  Our lender clients pay us directly for CPI and then add the cost of CPI to the borrower s loan.  Our CPI business is fully vertically integrated: we manage all aspects of the CPI business cycle, including sales and marketing, policy issuance, policy administration, underwriting and claims handling. 

Recent Developments 

On October 12, 2015, the Company announced a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $50 million in shares of the Company's common stock through December 31, 2016.  Repurchases are made in accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b-18 and may be made under Rule 10b5-1, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased 697,098 shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price including commissions of $7.1 million.  The excess cost of the repurchased shares over par value was charged to retained earnings. 

On September 28, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a non-admitted property and casualty shell company.  The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.   

On September 30, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of United National Specialty Insurance Company ( UNSIC ), an admitted shell company with licenses in 49 states.        The purpose of the acquisition is to provide exclusive capacity for one of our programs. 

Factors Affecting Our Operating Results 

Trending Market Opportunities.    We believe that macroeconomic conditions will provide us with growth opportunities in each of our business segments.  Increasing automobile sales should expand lenders  loan portfolios to improve our Lender Services results.  Over the past decade, alternative capital has been entering the reinsurance market at an accelerating pace.  This influx of capital has had the effect of compressing rates for reinsurance, which in the past was primarily written to reinsure catastrophe-exposed property insurance.  These lower reinsurance rates are now driving industry capital to seek opportunity in U.S. primary insurance markets for both property and casualty lines.  These market dynamics should provide growth opportunities in our Program Services segment. 

In our Lender Services business, we believe that organic growth from our existing lender clients will be driven by overall growth in lenders  portfolios as a result of rising automobile sales, higher average auto loan balances and an aging U.S. automobile fleet.  We expect that new sales from our alliance with CUNA Mutual and potential new business from banks and specialty finance companies will produce additional premiums. 

We believe that the increased role of capital market alternatives to reinsurance, including the capitalization of hedge fund-backed reinsurers and the availability of capital in the non-U.S. reinsurance market, is driving demand for our Program Services, as these firms typically do not have direct access to the U.S. insurance market.  We are well positioned to meet this demand due to our highly rated and broadly licensed insurance subsidiaries in addition to our proven model to provide fronting for a fee. 

We currently have a significant program with Nephila Capital, Ltd. ( Nephila ) under which we granted Nephila the exclusive right to utilize the Company as issuing carrier for U.S. catastrophe exposed property insurance from 2015 through 2019.  Nephila is a hedge fund with approximately $11 billion in assets under management that participates in the market for catastrophe exposed property business.  In exchange for this exclusive right, Nephila has agreed to pay State National contractual minimum ceding fees totaling $51.5 million through 2019. The minimum ceding fees are   

24 

Table of Contents  

subject to State National maintaining its  A  A.M. Best rating and potential reductions to the extent that State National is unable to provide production year capacity or is otherwise constrained from writing premium.  Also, under certain circumstances, Nephila may terminate the exclusivity, which would reduce the contractual minimum ceding fees to a total of $32.5 million for 2016 through 2019.  In the event of such a termination, State National would have the ability to write the catastrophe exposed property business for other capacity providers.  The timing and actual amount of gross premiums written for Nephila will impact the timing and amount of ceding fees earned each period under this program.  See   Principal Revenue and Expense Items Minimum ceding fees.   In addition, State National and Nephila have an alliance under which State National acquired one admitted property and casualty insurance shell company and has entered into an agreement to acquire one non-admitted property and casualty insurance shell company, which will be used exclusively to write the direct business produced by Nephila.  Nephila will have a three year option to purchase these companies beginning three years after the shell companies first write premium. In the event that the option is exercised, contractual minimum payments to State National will extend for an additional two years.   

Run-off of the Retained Business  .  In the past, the Company has participated to a limited extent on a quota share basis in certain programs in the Program Services segment.  From 2007 until 2011, California had required USIC to retain 10% of the risks written.  After this requirement was lifted in early 2012, the Company reinsured to inception the retained business under most of the active contracts, but others continue to run-off.  The Company has no active retained contracts and has no present intention of participating in future contracts.  We refer to this business as  the run-off of the retained business.   As of September 30, 2016, we had net reserves of $3.8 million related to this business. 

Seasonality of Our Business  .  Our Lender Services segment typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in written premium.  The fourth quarter tends to generate the greatest amount of written premium, whereas the first quarter of the year tends to generate the least.  We believe this trend follows loan delinquency patterns for the industry.  We generally do not experience seasonality in our Program Services segment. 

Principal Revenue and Expense Items 

Premiums earned.    Premiums earned are the earned portion of our net premiums written, which are predominately CPI premiums.  As the CPI product is not a traditional insurance product, the premium recognition is likewise different.  We do not record premiums until we collect them from our accounts since they have the right to waive the placement of insurance on any of their loans.  There is a high level of policy cancellations since borrowers often purchase insurance at the traditional rates that provides protection for them in addition to their lender.  Due to this high level of policy cancellations, we split the premium into two pieces:  (1) an allowance for future cancellations and (2) premiums that we expect to earn, which we refer to as  stick premiums.   We earn stick premiums on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies.  The CPI premiums written as presented in this document reflect the effects of the allowance for policy cancellations including any adjustments related to re-estimation of the allowance.  As such, our recorded CPI premiums written are those that we expect to earn while those that are expected to cancel are included in the allowance for policy cancellations.  At the end of each reporting period, stick premium written that is not earned is classified as unearned premium, which is earned in subsequent periods over the remaining terms of the policies.  Our policies typically have a term of one year, although the average duration of our CPI policies is typically less than six months due to policy cancellations. 

Ceding fees.    Ceding fees are fees we receive in the Program Services segment in exchange for providing access to the U.S. property and casualty insurance market and are based on the gross premiums we write on behalf of our GA and capacity provider clients.  We earn ceding fees in a manner consistent with the recognition of the gross premiums earned on the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured, which policies often have a one year term. 

Minimum ceding fees.    Minimum ceding fees are fees we receive pursuant to contractual minimum premium requirements for certain of our programs where either significant premium capacity is reserved for that program or where the expected premium volume is not reasonably assured.  For those programs where a minimum applies, the ceding fees are considered as two distinct pieces (1)  premium related fees,  which are earned as the associated gross written premium is earned, typically pro rata on an annual basis; and (2)  capacity fees,  which are determined based on   

25 

Table of Contents  

the shortfall, if any, between the program s contractual annual premium minimum and the amount of premium that we estimate will be written in the contract year, which fees are earned over the contract year. 

At the end of each quarter during the program contract year, we adjust the capacity fee based upon the re-estimated or actual amount of gross premiums that we expect will be written or that were written for that program for the full contract year.  If the estimated annual gross written premiums fall below the minimum contract level in a given period, capacity fees associated with the estimated premium shortfall for that period are earned in that period.  If the estimated annual gross written premiums equal or exceed the required minimum level for a given period, no capacity fees are recognized for that period, and the premium related fees are earned as the associated gross written premium is earned.  In connection with our re-estimation process, if in a subsequent period we increase our estimate of the amount of gross premiums that we expect will be written under a program for the full contract year, we will reverse a portion of the capacity fees earned in a prior period.  Conversely, to the extent that we decrease our estimate of gross premiums, we will recognize capacity fees associated with the additional shortfall in the current period. 

Losses and loss adjustment expenses.    Losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE ) include claims paid, estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing claims.  We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments based on historical experience.  We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on historical claims experience.  We revise our estimates as we receive additional information about claims and the total costs of settlement. 

Commissions.    Substantially all commission expenses are related to our Lender Services segment.  A significant portion of these amounts are paid to financial institutions as a means to reimburse the financial institution for costs associated with operating a CPI program.  These commissions are partially offset by a 21% ceding commission received under our quota reinsurance agreement with CUNA Mutual and the reimbursement we received from CUNA Mutual for 30% of direct commissions and other reimbursable expenses paid to accounts.  The ceding commission compensates us for expenses, such as underwriting and policy acquisition expenses, that we incur in connection with the writing of the ceded business. 

General and administrative expense.    General and administrative expense is composed of all other operating expenses, including various departmental salaries and benefits expense for employees.  General and administrative expense also includes expenses related to our office space, postage, telephone and information technology charges, as well as legal and auditing fees and corporate travel.  In addition, general and administrative expense includes those charges that are related to the amortization of tangible and intangible assets. 

Stock-based compensation expense.    Compensation expense for stock-based payments is recognized based on the measurement-date fair value for awards that will settle in shares.  Compensation expense for awards that are settled in equity is recognized on a straight line pro rata basis over the vesting period.   

Ratios 

Program Services Ratios 

Program gross expense ratio  .  The program gross expense ratio is a measure of our ability to earn increasing amounts of ceding fees with only minimal incremental expense in our Program Services business.  Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of general and administrative expense incurred to gross written premium.  Our GAs and capacity providers are responsible for providing all underwriting, policy administration, claims handling and other traditional insurance company services.  As a result, we are able to produce significant premium volume with only minimal operating expenses.  In addition, our fixed costs are a large component of the operating expenses while the incremental costs are small and are dependent upon the size and complexity of the programs being supported.  Our program gross expense ratio was 1.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Our objective is to produce a gross expense ratio in a range of 1.0% to 1.5%. 

26 

Table of Contents  

Gross leverage.    Gross leverage for the Company is the ratio of gross written premiums and gross liabilities to surplus.  A significant portion of our capital is used to support the gross premium and insurance liabilities in our Program Services segment.  Because we retain virtually no risk other than the credit risk of the capacity providers and we maintain strict credit underwriting standards, broad indemnification agreements and collateral requirements we are able to maintain significant ceded reinsurance business on a relatively small amount of capital compared to our peers.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, our gross leverage ratio was 14 to 1.  Our objective is to produce a total company gross leverage ratio of between 13 to 1 and 15 to 1. 

Lender Services Insurance Ratios 

Net loss ratio  .  The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of our Lender Services segment.  Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net losses and LAE incurred to net premiums earned.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our net loss ratio was 44.1% and 45.7%, respectively.  This decrease is primarily due to an increase in premiums earned, resulting in part from pricing adjustments on our CPI product. 

Net expense ratio  .  The net expense ratio is a component of our operational efficiency in administering our Lender Services segment.  Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net expenses (commissions, taxes, licenses, and fees and general and administrative) to net premiums earned.  Our expense ratio is higher than that for most traditional insurance products due to the labor and systems intensive processes involved in monitoring the insurance statuses for the loan portfolios of our Lender Services clients.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our net expense ratio was 40.4% and 42.1%, respectively. 

Net combined ratio  .  The net combined ratio is a measure of the overall profitability of our Lender Services segment.  This is the sum of the net loss ratio and the net expense ratio.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our net combined ratio was 84.5% and 87.8%, respectively.  Our objective is to price our products to achieve a net combined ratio between 85% to 90%. 

Financial Ratios 

Return on equity.    One of the key financial measures that we use to evaluate our operating performance is return on equity.  We calculate return on equity by dividing net income by the average GAAP equity.  Our return on equity at December 31, 2015 was 17.7%. Our overall financial objective is to produce a return on equity of at least 15% over the long-term. 

Financial leverage ratios.    Our financial leverage ratio at September 30, 2016 was 15.0%, as compared to 16.6% at December 31, 2015.  Our objective is to maintain a financial leverage ratio in the range of 20% to 35% over the long-term. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements include amounts that, either by their nature or due to the requirements of generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ( GAAP ), are determined using estimates and assumptions.  We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.  While we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented.  We believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are: unpaid losses and LAE reserves, allowance for policy cancellations, unearned premium reserve, reinsurance recoverable, valuation of our investment portfolio, assessment of other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI ) and minimum ceding fees. 

There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimation processes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Our critical accounting policies and estimation processes are described in our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 

Premiums earned.    Premiums earned increased by $3.5 million, from $30.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $33.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  This increase was due to an increase in Lender Services premiums earned.  Factors contributing to this increase are new sales, pricing adjustments and growth in the loan portfolios of existing accounts driven by rising automobile sales and higher average auto loan balances. 

Realized net investment gains (losses).    Realized net investment gains increased by $2.7 million, from a loss of $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to a gain of $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  This is partially related to the liquidation of fixed maturity securities for the purchase of UNSIC and expected acquisition of a non-admitted shell company.  Also, contributing to the increase is the change in fair value of embedded derivatives on the Company s convertible securities.  

Losses and loss adjustment expenses.    Losses and LAE decreased by $1.0 million, from $14.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $13.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which is due to prior year strengthening of reserves on the run-off of the retained business for Program Services. 

General and administrative expense  .  General and administrative expense increased by $2.7 million, from $14.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $17.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, reflecting investment in strategic growth, increased public company expenses, professional fees and stock-based compensation.

Income tax expense.    Income tax expense increased by $1.8 million, from $6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the overall increase in net income before tax. 

Consolidated Results of Operations for the Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the Nine Months ended September 30, 2015 

Premiums earned.    Premiums earned increased by $9.2 million, from $85.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $94.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This increase was due to an increase in Lender Services premiums earned.  Factors contributing to this increase are new sales, pricing adjustments and growth in the loan portfolios of existing accounts driven by rising automobile sales and higher average auto loan balances. 

Ceding fees.    Ceding fees increased by $3.0 million, from $49.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $52.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in Program gross premiums earned.  Program Services gross premiums earned increased from $745.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $872.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulting in an increase in premium related ceding fees of $5.2 million from new and existing accounts.  Capacity fees decreased $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September 30, 2015 due to an increase in premium-related fees and a decrease in minimum contractual fees for 2016 compared to 2015. 

Realized net investment gains (losses).    Realized net investment gains increased by $0.8 million, from a gain of $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to a gain of $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This is partially related to the liquidation of fixed maturity securities for the purchase of UNSIC and expected acquisition of a non-admitted shell company.  Also, contributing to the increase is the change in fair value of embedded derivatives on the Company s convertible securities.   

Losses and loss adjustment expenses.    Losses and LAE increased by $1.6 million, from $41.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $42.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which is primarily the result of increased exposure due to higher earned premiums and an increase in claim severity for the Lender Services segment.  A strengthening economy, an aging automobile fleet, and easier access to credit have contributed to an increase in vehicle sales, resulting in higher loan balances which are the bases upon which we pay claims.  

General and administrative expense  .  General and administrative expense increased by $4.8 million, from $46.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $51.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflecting investment in strategic growth, increased public company expenses, professional fees and stock-based compensation. 

Income tax expense.    Income tax expense increased by $2.1 million, from $17.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $19.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the overall increase in net income before tax.

Investment Portfolio 

Our investment strategy emphasizes, first, the preservation of capital and, second, the generation of an appropriate risk-adjusted return.  We seek to generate investment returns using investment guidelines that stress prudent allocation among cash and cash equivalents, fixed-maturity securities and, to a lesser extent, equity securities.  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit and short-term money market funds.  As of September 30, 2016, the tax adjusted yield on our fixed maturity and equity securities was 2.7%.  Convertible securities represent 13.6% of the portfolio at September 30, 2016, compared to 12.3% at December 31, 2015.  The average duration, excluding convertible securities, was approximately 4 years and included obligations of the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government agencies, obligations of U.S. and Canadian corporations, mortgages guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal Farm Credit entities, and asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage obligations.  Our equity securities include preferred stock and common stock of U.S. corporations.  Our investment portfolio is managed by Asset Allocation   Management Company, LLC and AAM Advisors, Inc. (collectively,  AAM ).  AAM operates under written investment guidelines approved by our board of directors.  We pay AAM an investment management fee based on the market value of assets under management. 

For each period specified below, the cost, fair value, and gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were as follows:

The table below summarizes the credit quality of our fixed-maturity securities as of September 30, 2016, as rated by Standard and Poor s. 

The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities held as of September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown in the table below.  Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

The tables below summarize the gross unrealized losses of fixed-maturity and preferred securities by the length of time the security had continuously been in an unrealized loss position for each year or shorter period specified below: 

There were 70 and 237 securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, that account for the gross unrealized loss, none of which we deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  Management believes that the temporary impairments are primarily the result of widening credit spreads, and that despite the wider credit spreads, the securities are only temporarily impaired due to the strength of the issuing companies  balance sheets, as well as their available liquidity options.  We do not intend to sell or believe we will be required to sell any of our temporarily-

impaired fixed maturities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.  Management has the intent and ability to hold the equity securities in an unrealized loss position until the recovery of their fair value.  Therefore, Management does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. 

We are required to maintain deposits in various states where the insurance subsidiaries are licensed to operate.  These deposits are fixed maturity securities at fair values totaling $76.9 million and $53.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The increase in the amounts on deposit at September 30, 2016 is due to an increase in the required deposits for workers  compensation business and deposits acquired in the acquisition of UNSIC. 

Fair value of financial instruments.    ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , provides a definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.  The standard applies when GAAP requires or allows assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value; therefore, it does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstance.  Investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are all considered level 2 investments. 

Liquidity 

We are organized as a holding company with four domestic insurance company subsidiaries, as well as a wholly-owned subsidiary that operates in an agency capacity.  Our principal sources of operating funds are premiums, ceding fees, investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments.  Our primary uses of operating funds include payments of claims and operating expenses.  We pay claims using cash flow from operations and invest our excess cash primarily in fixed-income securities.  We expect that projected cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our anticipated growth and to pay claims and operating expenses, interest on debt facilities and other holding company expenses for the foreseeable future.  However, if our growth attributable to potential acquisitions, internally generated growth, or a combination of these factors, exceeds our expectations, we may have to raise additional capital in the near term.  If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  We may generate liquidity through the issuance of debt or equity securities or financing through borrowings under credit facilities, or a combination thereof. 

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions imposed on insurance companies by their states of domicile which limit the amount of cash dividends or distributions that they may pay to us unless special permission is received from the insurance regulator of the relevant domiciliary state.  The aggregate limit imposed by the various domiciliary states of our insurance subsidiaries was approximately $23.0 million and $21.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  In addition, we are able to generate substantial cash flow outside of our regulated insurance company subsidiaries through intercompany agency and management agreements between our insurance subsidiaries and our agency, TBA.  TBA functions as a managing general agent for SNIC and NSIC in connection with the Lender Services segment.  Under the management agreement TBA provides business development, financial monitoring and other oversight functions to our insurance subsidiaries. 

The following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows:

Table of Contents  

Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Net cash used in operating activities increased $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in Lender Services and Program Services operating results.  

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $22.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the liquidation of investments related to the acquisition of UNSIC and expected acquisition of a non-admitted shell company.  These decreases were largely offset by the purchase of UNSIC on September 30, 2016 in the amount of $17.3 million, net of cash acquired. 

Net cash used in financing activities increased $11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the settlement of $9.9 million in stock repurchases in 2016 and an increase of $1.5 million in dividends paid in 2016. 

Other Material Changes in Financial Position 

Accounts receivable from agents, net.    This balance reflects ceding fees, premiums and premium taxes receivable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, accounts receivable from agents increased $8.6 million from December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in Program Services receivables.  This increase partially relates to an agreement with Nephila we entered into effective January 1, 2016.  For Nephila, we will, at Nephila s request, transfer certain exposures that are otherwise reinsured by Nephila s quota share reinsurer to excess reinsurers.  In instances where this agreement is utilized, State National enters into an agreement directly with excess reinsurers, and Nephila guarantees the obligation of those excess reinsurers and pays the premiums on our behalf on a quarterly basis in arrears.  We purchased one excess reinsurance policy under this agreement during 2016.  The remainder of the increase relates to one of our arrangements under which we are responsible to certain reinsurers for the collection and payment of premiums.  As a result, the related premiums receivable and payable are reflected in our balance sheet. 

Goodwill and intangible assets, net.      As of September 30, 2016, goodwill and intangible assets increased $6.8 million compared to September 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in indefinite-lived intangible assets of $7.4 million related to the UNSIC acquisition. 

Reinsurance recoverables, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums.      As of September 30, 2016, we held $2.3 billion in collateral securing $1.7 billion in reinsurance recoverables.  In addition, we had $640.1 million of unsecured reinsurance recoverables, of which $632.8 million related to the Program Services segment and $7.3 million related to our quota share reinsurance with CUNA Mutual, an A.M. Best  A  rated carrier.  During the nine   

36 

Table of Contents  

months ended September 30, 2016, reinsurance recoverables increased $379.5 million from December 31, 2015, which was primarily a result of the increase in gross premiums written for Program Services business due to the addition of new programs and expansion of existing programs.  These factors also caused an increase in the corresponding unearned premiums and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $88.2 million and $290.1 million, respectively. 

Allowance for policy cancellations.    As of September 30, 2016, the allowance for policy cancellations increased by $5.1 million from December 31, 2015, primarily due to the volume and timing of CPI premiums written in the most recent three months of 2016 compared to the last three months of 2015.  The fourth quarter tends to generate the greatest amount of written premium, whereas the first quarter of the year tends to generate the least.  On a quarterly basis, we review our estimates for allowance for policy cancellations to determine whether further adjustments are appropriate.  Any resulting adjustments are included in the current period s operating results.  The allowance for policy cancellations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included upward revisions to prior year estimates of $1.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively.  Because of the interplay between the allowance for policy cancellations and the related unearned premium reserve, changes in the allowance for policy cancellations are partially offset by related changes in the unearned premium reserve and amounts ceded to reinsurers.  After taking into account the associated changes in unearned premium and amounts ceded to reinsurers, the net impact to the balance sheet and the corresponding reduction in net income from the revised estimates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $0.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively. 

Other liabilities.    As of September 30, 2016, other liabilities decreased by $2.1 million from December 31, 2015, primarily due to settlements of the annual executive bonuses, stock repurchases and a decrease in funds held related to payments made for a run off program.  This is partially offset by a $2.5 million quarterly dividend accrual as of September 30, 2016. 

Capital Resources 

The Company has three statutory business trusts that were formed between 2002 and 2004, for the sole purpose of issuing $44.5 million of trust preferred securities in private offering transactions.  The trusts used the proceeds from these offerings, together with the equity proceeds received upon their initial formation from TBA, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of State National, to purchase variable-rate subordinated debentures issued by TBA.  All voting securities of the trusts are owned by TBA, and the debentures are the sole assets of the trusts.  The trusts meet the obligations of the trust preferred securities with the interest and principal paid on the debentures.  These debentures  interest rates range from 3.80% to 4.10% plus the 3-month LIBOR.  The three month LIBOR at September 30, 2016, was 0.85%.  All of the debentures mature between 2032 and 2034. 

On March 31, 2016, the Company, through TBA, entered into a loan agreement, which provides for a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $15 million.  The credit agreement matures on April 30, 2018.  Under the credit agreement, TBA may request advances up to the aggregate amount of the unused commitment under the credit facility, on a revolving basis, prior to the maturity of the credit agreement.  Borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.85% per annum; provided, however, that LIBOR shall be subject to a floor of 0.15%.  TBA shall also pay a commitment fee on the daily average unused commitment amount for the period running from the closing date to the maturity date at a rate of 0.125% per annum.  The credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default, as well as a financial covenant requiring TBA and the Company to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of at least $150 million. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk represents our potential inability to meet all payment obligations when they become due.  We maintain sufficient cash and marketable securities to fund claim payments and operations. 

37 

Table of Contents  

Credit Risk 

We are exposed to credit risk from potential losses arising principally from the financial condition of our third party reinsurers, and also from potential losses in our investment portfolio.  Although our third party reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us to the extent we cede risk to them, we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have ceded.  As a result, reinsurance contracts do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims covered under the insurance policies we issue and we might not collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers.  We generally address this credit risk by either (1) selecting reinsurers that have an A.M. Best rating of  A-  (Excellent) or better, have $300 million in equity and/or capital and surplus and are a Texas or Delaware (for USIC) authorized reinsurer at the time we enter into the agreement, or (2) requiring that the reinsurer post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks.  Security can take the form of collateral (in the form of security posted with a trustee pursuant to a related agreement, or evergreen letter of credit), or guaranty by a related third party that we believe has the ability to pay.  The security amount is a function of the policyholder liabilities (unearned premiums, losses and LAE reserves) or other amounts that are more representative of the amounts at risk.  Excess security is required when a reinsurer does not meet the above financial requirements to provide a  cushion  for inadequate estimates of policyholder liabilities.  Unless there is some mitigating factor, we control the ability to set policyholder liability amounts for security purposes. 

Security is also immediately required if a reinsurer falls below the benchmark rating during the term of a reinsurance agreement.  Existing security may be increased if a reinsurer is downgraded during the term of a reinsurance agreement or experiences a significant loss in policyholder equity and/or capital and surplus. 

Collateral levels are reviewed weekly on each reinsurer on which security is required.  Collateral calculations are adjusted as monthly activity reports are received on individual programs and collateral account balance information is available.  Collateral is generally obtained a quarter in advance at the end of each calendar quarter. 

We also evaluate the credit risk of our investment portfolio.  The primary measure we utilize to mitigate credit risk (the risk of principal default on the securities we invested in) involves the credit quality of our portfolio.  Approximately 66% of our portfolio is rated AA- or higher (rated by Standard   Poor s), which is consistent with the guidelines provided to our asset managers.  Additionally, our Investment Committee reviews the portfolio on a quarterly basis and discusses any securities which have been downgraded in the previous quarter. 

Market Risk 

The risk of underperformance in the market is addressed by having a quality asset manager administering our portfolio.  Additionally, our portfolio is diversified to eliminate exposure to any one particular segment.  Finally, as the bulk of our assets support either our surplus or short tailed lines of business, investment performance is a relatively small portion of our profits relative to other property and casualty companies. 

Our investment policy is reviewed periodically and updated to meet current needs.  However, the primary goal and philosophy of the policy is to be conservative in nature to provide preservation of principal and provide necessary liquidity. 

Interest Rate Risk 

This is a two-fold risk involving loss of market value due to a rising interest rate environment coupled with a need to liquidate those securities to provide liquidity for operations.  Our exposure to extreme shifts in interest rates is mitigated to some extent by selecting a duration target for the portfolio which is relatively short (i.e., approximately four years).  The exposure to actually selling underwater securities to gain liquidity is managed by maintaining a laddered portfolio whereby we have securities maturing over the next few years.  Further mitigation is provided by maintaining the convexity (i.e., how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes) of the portfolio at relatively low levels. 

We had fixed-maturity securities with a fair value of $337.6 million and an amortized cost of $327.8 million as of September 30, 2016 that are subject to interest rate risk.  Interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to

adverse changes in interest rates.  Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of our fixed-maturity securities.  In the management of this risk, the characteristics of duration, credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements. 

The table below summarizes the interest rate risk associated with our fixed-maturity securities by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value of our fixed-maturity securities as of September 30, 2016 to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, and the associated impact on our shareholders  equity.  We anticipate that we will continue to meet our obligations from operating cash flows.  We classify our fixed-maturity securities and equity securities as available-for-sale.  Temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed-maturity securities impact the carrying value of these securities and are reported in our shareholders  equity as a component of other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes.  The selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events, but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the fair value and carrying value of our fixed-maturity securities and on our shareholders  equity, each as of September 30, 2016. 

Changes in interest rates would affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt instruments but would not have an impact on our earnings or cash flow.  As of September 30, 2016, we had $44.5 million of debt instruments, gross of debt issuance costs.  A fluctuation of 100 basis points in interest on our variable-rate debt instruments, which are tied to LIBOR, would affect our earnings and cash flows by $0.4 million before income tax, on an annual basis, but would not affect the fair value of the variable-rate debt. 

Item 4:  Controls and Procedures   

Under the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  We note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving the stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) as of the end of the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
