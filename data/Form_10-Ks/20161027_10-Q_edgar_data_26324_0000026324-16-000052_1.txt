  (UNAUDITED) 

1  .           BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  Curtiss-Wright Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Corporation" or the "Company") is a diversified multinational manufacturing and service company that designs, manufactures, and overhauls precision components and provides highly engineered products and services to the aerospace, defense, power generation, and general industrial markets. 
    
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Curtiss-Wright and its majority-owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 
    
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Corporation have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of these financial statements. 
    
  Management is required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the accompanying financial statements.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The most significant of these estimates includes the estimate of costs to complete long-term contracts under the percentage-of-completion accounting methods, the estimate of useful lives for property, plant, and equipment, cash flow estimates used for testing the recoverability of assets, pension plan and postretirement obligation assumptions, estimates for inventory obsolescence, estimates for the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets, legal reserves, and the estimate of future environmental costs.  Changes in estimates of contract sales, costs, and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.  This method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods. Accordingly, the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate.   
    
  During the second quarter of   2015  , the Corporation recorded additional costs of   $11.5 million   related to its long-term contract with Westinghouse to deliver reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) for the AP1000 nuclear power plants in China.  The increase in costs is due to a change in estimate related to production modifications that are the result of engineering and endurance testing. During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no other individual significant changes in estimated contract costs. 
    
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Corporation s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of trends or of the operating results for a full year. 
    
  Recent accounting pronouncements adopted 
  Accounting pronouncement   ASU 2015-17 - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   was early adopted effective January 1, 2016 and accounting pronouncement   ASU 2015-03 - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   was adopted effective January 1, 2016.  Both pronouncements were retrospectively adopted and, accordingly, certain amounts reported in the previous periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  
    
  A summary of the impact of the reclassifications as of December 31, 2015 is shown in the below table.

Recent accounting pronouncements to be adopted                   Standard 
    Description 
    Effect on the financial statements 
      ASU 2014-09 Revenue from contracts with customers 
    In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard which will supersede previous existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard creates a five-step model for revenue recognition that requires companies to exercise judgment when considering contract terms and relevant facts and circumstances. The five-step model includes (1) identifying the contract, (2) identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations and (5) recognizing revenue when each performance obligation has been satisfied. The standard also requires expanded disclosures surrounding revenue recognition.  The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. 
    The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
      Date of adoption: January 1, 2018 
      ASU 2016-02 Leases 
    In February 2016, the FASB issued final guidance that will require lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today s accounting. 
    The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
      Date of adoption: January 1, 2019 
      ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. 
    The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
      Date of adoption: January 1, 2017 

2  .           DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE 
    
  As part of a strategic portfolio review conducted in 2014, the Corporation identified certain businesses it considered non-core.  The Corporation considers businesses non-core when the business  products or services do not complement its existing businesses and where the long-term growth and profitability prospects are below the Corporation s expectations.  In 2015, the Corporation divested all   five   businesses that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2014.  The results of operations of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
    
  The aggregate financial results of all discontinued operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

Page   10 

CURTISS-WRIGHT CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES to CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

(1)    Loss from discontinued operations before income taxes includes approximately   $41 million   of held for sale impairment expense recorded in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
   (2)    Net of tax benefit for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $3.0 million  , respectively.  
    
  Divestitures 
    
  In October 2015 and August 2015, the Corporation sold its   two   surface technology treatment facilities for an immaterial amount, that were previously classified as held for sale. 
    
  In July 2015, the Corporation sold the assets and liabilities of its Engineered Packaging business for approximately   $14 million   and recognized a pre-tax gain of   $2.3 million  .   
    
  In   May 2015  , the Corporation completed the divestiture of its Downstream oil and gas business for   $19 million  , net of transaction costs.  The business had recorded impairment charges of   $40 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . In connection with the sale, the Corporation realized a pre-tax loss on divestiture of $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
    
  In   January 2015  , the Corporation sold the assets of its Aviation Ground support business for    3 million   (  $4 million  ).  
    
  For the year ended December 31,   2015  , the Corporation disposed of   five   businesses in total aggregating to total cash proceeds of   $31 million  .  The divestitures resulted in aggregate pre-tax losses in excess of   $17 million  , and tax benefits of approximately   $3.3 million  .  Aggregate net sales attributable to these 2015 divestitures and facility closures for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   were   $0.7 million   and   $58.0 million  , respectively, and losses before income taxes for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   were   $0.9 million   and   $40.8 million  , respectively. 

3  .           RECEIVABLES 
    
  Receivables primarily include amounts billed to customers, unbilled charges on long-term contracts consisting of amounts recognized as sales but not billed, and other receivables.  Substantially all amounts of unbilled receivables are expected to be billed and collected within one year.  An immaterial amount of unbilled receivables are subject to retainage provisions.  The amount of claims and unapproved change orders within our receivables balances are immaterial.   
    
  The composition of receivables is as follows: 

4  .           INVENTORIES 
    
  Inventoried costs contain amounts relating to long-term contracts and programs with long production cycles, a portion of which will not be realized within one year.  Long-term contract inventory includes an immaterial amount of claims or other similar items subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or realization.  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The composition of inventories is as follows: 

Page   11 

CURTISS-WRIGHT CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES to CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

Inventoried costs related to long-term contracts include capitalized contract development costs related to certain aerospace and defense programs of   $29.9 million   and   $29.7 million  , as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , respectively.  These capitalized costs will be liquidated as production units are delivered to the customers.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $1.7 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively, are scheduled to be liquidated under existing firm orders. 

5  .           GOODWILL 
    
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

6  .           OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET 
    
  The following tables present the cumulative composition of the Corporation s intangible assets: 

Total intangible amortization expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $24.9 million   as compared to   $26.2 million   in the prior year period.  The estimated amortization expense for the five years ending   December 31, 2016   through   2020   is   $33.2 million  ,   $32.7 million  ,   $31.6 million  ,   $29.8 million  , and   $27.9 million  , respectively. 

7  .           FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  Forward Foreign Exchange and Currency Option Contracts 
    
  The Corporation has foreign currency exposure primarily in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Canada.  The Corporation uses financial instruments, such as forward and option contracts, to hedge a portion of existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions.  The purpose of the Corporation s foreign currency risk management program is to reduce volatility in earnings caused by exchange rate fluctuations.  Guidance on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires companies to recognize all of the derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets based upon quoted market prices for comparable instruments. 
    
  Interest Rate Risks and Related Strategies 

Page   12 

CURTISS-WRIGHT CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES to CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

The Corporation s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in U.S. dollar interest rates. The Corporation s policy is to manage interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Corporation periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage such exposures. Under these interest rate swaps, the Corporation exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. 
    
  For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges (i.e., hedges against the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk), changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in market interest rates. 
    
  On February 5, 2016, the Corporation terminated its March 2013 and January 2012 interest rate swap agreements.  As a result of the termination, the Corporation received a cash payment of   $20.4 million  , representing the fair value of the interest rate swaps on the date of termination.  In connection with the termination, the Corporation and the counterparties released each other from all obligations under the interest rate swaps agreement, including, without limitation, the obligation to make periodic payments under such agreements.  The gain on termination is reflected as a bond premium to our notes' carrying value and amortized prospectively into interest expense over the remaining terms of the Senior Notes.   
    
  The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
    
  Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access. 
    
  Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. 
    
  Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data. 
    
  Based upon the fair value hierarchy, all of the forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are valued at a Level 2. 
    
  Effects on Consolidated Balance Sheets 
    
  The location and amounts of derivative instrument fair values in the condensed consolidated balance sheet are below. 

(A)  Forward exchange derivatives are included in Other current assets and interest rate swap assets are included in Other assets. 
  (B)  Forward exchange derivatives are included in Other current liabilities.

CURTISS-WRIGHT CORPORATION and SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES to CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

The location and amount of   losses on the hedged fixed rate debt   attributable to changes in the market interest rates and the offsetting   gain on the related interest rate swaps   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30,   2016 and 2015, were as follows: 

Undesignated hedges 
    
  The location and amount of   gains and (losses)   recognized in income on forward exchange derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,   were as follows: 

Debt 
    
  The estimated fair value amounts were determined by the Corporation using available market information that is primarily based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues as of   September 30, 2016  .  Accordingly, all of the Corporation s debt is valued at a Level 2.  The fair values described below may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.  Furthermore, the use of different methodologies to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. 

(1)    Effective for 2016, the Company adopted   ASU 2015-03 - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   requiring unamortized debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.  Prior year balances have been reclassified to reflect the current year presentation. 
    
   (2)    In February 2016, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreements.   Upon termination of the interest rate swaps, the Corporation received   $20.4 million   in cash and recorded a deferred gain of   $18.3 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the

  NOTES to CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 

remaining benefit of   $17.1 million   was recorded as an increase in the long-term debt balance and will be recognized ratably as a reduction to future interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt.  
    
  Nonrecurring measurements  
  As discussed in Note 2, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held For Sale, the Corporation classified certain businesses as held for sale during 2014.   In accordance with the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets guidance of FASB Codification Subtopic 360 10, the carrying amount of the disposal groups were written down to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of   $40.8 million  , which was included in the loss from discontinued operations before income taxes for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The fair value of the disposal groups were determined primarily by using non-binding quotes.  In accordance with the fair value hierarchy, the impairment charge is classified as a Level 3 measurement as it is based on significant other unobservable inputs. 

8  .           PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 
    
  The following tables are consolidated disclosures of all domestic and foreign defined pension plans as described in the Corporation s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.   
    
  Pension Plans 
    
  The components of net periodic pension cost for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Corporation made no contributions to the Curtiss-Wright Pension Plan, and does not expect to make any contributions in 2016.  Effective May 1, 2016, the Corporation completed the merger of   three   frozen UK defined benefit pension schemes by merging the Metal Improvement Company Salaried Staff Pension Scheme and the Mechetronics Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme into the Curtiss-Wright Penny   Giles Pension Plan.  The Penny   Giles Plan was then renamed the Curtiss-Wright UK Pension Plan.   
    
  In connection with the merger, the Corporation made an additional    3 million   (approximately   $4.4 million  ) cash contribution to the plan. The merger will benefit the Corporation by cost reduction achieved through streamlined advisor services and more efficient trust administration. 
    
  Scheduled contributions to the foreign benefit plans are not expected to be material in   2016  . 
    
  The settlement charges recognized in the third quarter of 2015 represent events that are accounted for under guidance on employers  accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans.  The charge is primarily a result of the retirement of the Corporation s former Chairman and his election to receive the nonqualified portion of his pension benefit as a single lump sum payout and relates to the recognition of deferred actuarial losses triggered by the lump sum payouts exceeding a prescribed threshold.

Effective   January 1, 2014  , all non-union employees who are not currently receiving final or career average pay benefits became eligible to receive employer contributions in the Corporation s sponsored 401(k) plan. The employer contributions include both employer match and non-elective contribution components, up to a maximum employer contribution of   6%   of eligible compensation. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the expense relating to the plan was   $8.9 million   and   $9.6 million  , respectively. The Corporation made   $10.4 million   in contributions to the plan during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and expects to make total contributions of   $11.5 million   in   2016  . 

9  .           EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  Diluted earnings per share were computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive common shares.  A reconciliation of basic to diluted shares used in the earnings per share calculation is as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, there were   no   stock options outstanding that were considered anti-dilutive. 

10  .           SEGMENT INFORMATION 
    
  The Corporation manages and evaluates its operations based on end markets to strengthen its ability to service customers and recognize certain organizational efficiencies.  Based on this approach, the Corporation has three reportable segments: Commercial/Industrial, Defense, and Power. 
    
  The Corporation s measure of segment profit or loss is operating income.  Interest expense and income taxes are not reported on an operating segment basis as they are not considered in the segments  performance evaluation by the Corporation s chief operating decision-maker, its Chief Executive Officer. 
  Net sales and operating income by reportable segment were as follows:

  Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Corporation has been named in a number of lawsuits that allege injury from exposure to asbestos.  To date, the Corporation has not been found liable for or paid any material sum of money in settlement in any case.  The Corporation believes its minimal use of asbestos in its past operations and the relatively non-friable condition of asbestos in its products makes it unlikely that it will face material liability in any asbestos litigation, whether individually or in the aggregate.  The Corporation maintains insurance coverage for these potential liabilities and believes adequate coverage exists to cover any unanticipated asbestos liability. 
    
  In December 2013, the Corporation, along with other unaffiliated parties, received a claim from Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) filed in the Court of Queen s Bench of Alberta, Judicial District of Calgary.  The claim pertains to a January 2011 fire and explosion at a delayed coker unit at its Fort McMurray refinery that resulted in the injury of five CNRL employees, damage to property and equipment, and various forms of consequential loss, such as loss of profit, lost opportunities, and business interruption.  The fire and explosion occurred when a CNRL employee bypassed certain safety controls and opened an operating coker unit.  The total quantum of alleged damages arising from the incident has not been finalized, but is estimated to meet or exceed   $1 billion  .  The Corporation maintains various forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability, and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us. The Corporation is currently unable to estimate an amount, or range of potential losses, if any, from this matter. The Corporation believes it has adequate legal defenses and intends to defend this matter vigorously.  The Corporation s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, could be materially affected during a future fiscal quarter or fiscal year by unfavorable developments or outcome regarding this claim.  
    
  In addition to the CNRL litigation, the Corporation is party to a number of other legal actions and claims, none of which individually or in the aggregate, in the opinion of management, are expected to have a material effect on the Corporation s results of operations or financial position. 
    
  Letters of Credit and Other Financial Arrangements 
    
  The Corporation enters into standby letters of credit agreements and guarantees with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to guarantees of repayment, future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services, and to secure advance payments from certain international customers. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   $36.9 million   and   $37.3 million   of stand-by letters of credit outstanding, respectively, and   $13.9 million   and   $14.7 million   of bank guarantees outstanding, respectively. In addition, the Corporation is required to provide the Nuclear Regulatory Commission financial assurance demonstrating its ability to cover the cost of decommissioning its Cheswick, Pennsylvania facility upon closure, though the Corporation does not intend to close this facility.  The Corporation has provided this financial assurance in the form of a   $56.0 million   surety bond. 
    
  AP1000 Program 
    
  The Electro-Mechanical Division, which is within the Corporation s Power segment, is the reactor coolant pump (RCP) supplier for the Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear power plants under construction in China and the United States.  The terms of

the AP1000 China and United States contracts include liquidated damage penalty provisions for failure to meet contractual delivery dates if the Corporation caused the delay and the delay was not excusable. On October 10, 2013, the Corporation received a letter from Westinghouse stating entitlements to the maximum amount of liquidated damages allowable under the AP1000 China contract from Westinghouse of approximately   $25 million  .  The Corporation would be liable for liquidated damages under the contract if certain contractual delivery dates were not met and if the Corporation was deemed responsible for the delay.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation has not met certain contractual delivery dates under its AP 1000 China and US contracts; however there are significant uncertainties as to which parties are responsible for the delays. The Corporation believes it has adequate legal defenses and intends to vigorously defend this matter. Given the uncertainties surrounding the responsibility for the delays no accrual has been made for this matter as of   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the range of possible loss is   $0   to   $55.5 million  .

COMPANY ORGANIZATION 
    
  Curtiss-Wright Corporation is a diversified, multinational provider of highly engineered, technologically advanced, value-added products and services to a broad range of industries which are reported through our Commercial/Industrial, Defense, and Power segments.  We are positioned as a market leader across a diversified array of niche markets through engineering and technological leadership, precision manufacturing, and strong relationships with our customers.  We provide products and services to a number of global markets and have achieved balanced growth through the successful application of our core competencies in engineering and precision manufacturing.  Our overall strategy is to be a balanced and diversified company, less vulnerable to cycles or downturns in any one market, and to establish strong positions in profitable niche markets.  Approximately 38% of our   2016   revenues are expected to be generated from defense-related markets. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of the Corporation for three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  . The financial information as of   September 30, 2016   should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contained in our Form 10-K.  
    
  The MD A is organized into the following sections:  Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Results by Business Segment, and Liquidity and Capital Resources.  Our discussion will be focused on the overall results of continuing operations followed by a more detailed discussion of those results within each of our reportable segments. 
    
  Our three reportable segments are generally concentrated in a few end markets; however, each may have sales across several end markets.  An end market is defined as an area of demand for products and services.  The sales for the relevant markets will be discussed throughout the MD A.  
    
  Analytical Definitions 
    
  Throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, the terms  incremental  and  organic  are used to explain changes from period to period. The term  incremental  is used to highlight the impact acquisitions and divestitures had on the current year results.  The results of operations for acquisitions are incremental for the first twelve months from the date of acquisition. Additionally, the results of operations of divested businesses are removed from the comparable prior year period for purposes of calculating  organic  or  incremental  results.  The definition of  organic  excludes the effect of foreign currency translation.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION and RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 

Components of sales and operating income increase (decrease): 

Sales   for the   third quarter   of   2016     decreased     $18 million  , or   4%  , to   $507 million  , compared with the prior year period.  On a segment basis, sales from the Commercial/Industrial segment and Defense segment   decreased     $17 million   and   $3 million  , respectively, while sales in the Power segment increased $2 million.  
    
  Sales during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $74 million  , or   5%  , to   $1,543 million  , compared with the prior year period. On a segment basis, sales from the Commercial/Industrial, Defense and Power segments decreased $55 million, $17 million, and $2 million, respectively. Changes in sales by segment are discussed in further detail in the results by business segment section below. 
    
  Operating income   in the   third quarter   of   2016     increased     $13 million  , or   20%  , to   $77 million  , and operating margin   increased     300   basis points to   15.1%   compared with the same period in   2015  . The increase in operating income and margin is primarily attributable to a one-time pension settlement charge of $7 million recorded during the prior year period related to the retirement of the Company s former Chairman.  In addition, a shift in mix for our Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products and smaller

non-recurring items benefited operating income and operating margin in the Defense segment. These increases were partially offset by lower operating income in the Commercial/Industrial segment, primarily due to lower sales volumes on severe-service industrial valves and surface treatment services. Operating income for the Power segment was essentially flat as higher AP1000 sales volumes and lower costs were partially offset by lower sales volumes supporting domestic nuclear operating reactors. 
    
  For the first nine months of 2016, operating income was flat against the prior year period and operating margin increased 600 basis points to 13.1%. Decreases in operating income and operating margin in the Commercial/Industrial segment were primarily driven by lower sales volumes of our severe-service industrial valves and surface treatment services, partially offset by improved operating income in the Power segment, primarily driven by higher AP1000 sales volumes and lower costs. The remaining decrease was offset by lower corporate expenses due to lower pension charges, primarily related to the retirement of the Company s former Chairman during the prior year period. 
    
  Non-segment operating expense   in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 decreased $10 million, or 65%, to $5 million and $14 million, or 47%, to $15 million, respectively, from the comparable prior year periods. These decreases were primarily due to the one-time pension settlement charge discussed above and lower pension expenses.   
    
  Interest expense   in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 increased $2 million, or 17%, to $10 million and $4 million, or 14%, to $31 million, respectively, from the comparable prior year periods. These decreases were primarily due to the termination of our interest rate swaps in the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  The effective tax   rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 31.0%, as compared to an effective tax rate of 30.7% in the prior year period.  The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced foreign earnings offset by certain valuation allowances that did not recur in the current period.  The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of 31.0% was essentially flat compared to an effective tax rate of 30.9% in the prior year period. 
     
  Comprehensive   income     in the third quarter of 2016 was $35 million, compared to a comprehensive loss of $3 million in the prior year period. The change was primarily due to the following: 

Net earnings increased $12 million, primarily due to higher earnings from continuing operations of $8 million as higher operating income was partially offset by higher interest expense. Net earnings also benefited from higher earnings from discontinued operations of $4 million which were zero in the current period as compared to a loss of $4 million in the prior period.  
                
    Foreign currency translation adjustments in the third quarter of 2016 resulted in a $12 million comprehensive loss, compared to a $38 million comprehensive loss in the prior year period. The comprehensive loss during the current period was primarily attributed to decreases in the British Pound. 
                
    Pension and postretirement adjustments within comprehensive income of $2 million were essentially flat against the comparable prior year period. 
       
  Comprehensive income in the first nine months of 2016 was $97 million, compared to comprehensive income of $19 million in the prior year period. The change was primarily due to the following: 

Net earnings increased $43 million, primarily due to the increase in earnings from discontinued operations which were zero in the current period as compared to a loss of $46 million in the prior period. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $3 million in earnings from continuing operations due primarily to higher interest expense.  
                
    Foreign currency translation adjustments for the first nine months of 2016 resulted in a $27 million comprehensive loss, compared to a $62 million comprehensive loss in the prior period. The comprehensive loss during the current period was primarily attributed to decreases in the British Pound, partially offset by increases in the Canadian dollar. 
                
    Pension and postretirement adjustments within comprehensive income decreased approximately $1 million, to $5 million, due to a reduction in the amortization of prior service costs and actuarial losses. 
       
  New orders   increased $6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, from the prior year period. The increase in new orders was primarily due to timing of funding with government customers in the Defense segment. New orders in the Commercial/Industrial segment increased due to the timing of orders received from Boeing. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in new orders in the Power segment due to the timing of funding for pumps and generators with government customers.

New orders increased $4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from the prior year period. The increase in new orders in the Power segment was primarily due to the purchase of pumps by a commercial customer and the timing of funding of government orders. New orders in the Commercial/Industrial segment increased due to the timing of orders received from Boeing and growth in our naval valves, partially offset by lower demand for our severe-service valves. These net increases were partially offset by decreases in the Defense segment primarily due to a significant turret drive stabilization systems (TDSS) production contract received during the second quarter of 2015 as well as the timing of government orders. 

RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 
    
  Commercial/Industrial 
    
  The following tables summarize sales, operating income and margin, and new orders within the Commercial/Industrial segment.   

Components of sales and operating income increase (decrease): 

Sales   in the Commercial/Industrial segment are primarily generated from the commercial aerospace and general industrial markets, and to a lesser extent the defense and power generation markets.  
    
  Sales in the   third quarter   decreased   $17 million  , or   6%  , to $276 million from the prior year period. The decrease in sales is primarily due to lower sales of severe-service valves to oil and gas markets of $13 million and a reduction in sales for industrial vehicle products. 
    
  Sales during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased $55 million, or 6%, to $840 million from the prior year period. In the general industrial market, we experienced lower sales of severe-service valves to oil and gas markets of $42 million and a reduction in sales for our industrial vehicle, medical mobility, and industrial automation products. Within the commercial aerospace market, higher sales of actuation and sensors and control products, primarily to Boeing, were partially offset by lower sales of surface technology services, primarily to Airbus. 
    
  Operating income   during the third quarter decreased $1 million, or 3%, to $39 million from the prior year period, while operating margin increased 40 basis points to 14.2%.  The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower sales

volumes of our severe-service industrial valves and surface treatment services with operating margin benefiting from our margin improvement and cost containment initiatives. 
    
  Operating income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $21 million, or 16%, to $108 million from the prior year period, while operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 12.9%. The decreases in operating income and operating margin were primarily driven by lower sales volumes of our severe-service industrial valves and surface technology treatment services. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of our margin improvement initiatives and favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $3 million.  
    
  New orders   increased   $3 million   and   $34 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, against the comparable prior year periods. The increase in new orders is primarily due to the timing of orders received from Boeing and growth in our naval valves, partially offset by lower demand for our severe-service valves. 
    
  Defense 
    
  The following tables summarize sales, operating income and margin, and new orders within the Defense segment.    

Components of sales and operating income increase (decrease): 

Sales   in the Defense segment are primarily to the defense markets and, to a lesser extent, the commercial aerospace and the general industrial markets.  
    
  Sales in the   third quarter   decreased   $3 million  , or   3%  , to $114 million from the prior year period, primarily due to lower sales in the aerospace defense market. The decrease is primarily due to lower sales of embedded computing products on various fighter jet and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) programs. 
     
  Sales during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $17 million  , or   5%  , to $333 million from the prior year period, primarily due to lower sales in the aerospace defense and commercial aerospace markets. The decrease in sales in the aerospace defense market is primarily due to lower foreign military sales. Sales in the commercial aerospace market decreased primarily due to lower sales of avionics and electronics products. 
    
  Operating income   during the third quarter increased $  3 million  , or   13%  , to $  29 million  , and operating margin increased 360 basis points from the prior year quarter to 25.3%. The increases in operating income and operating margin were primarily driven by a shift in mix for our COTS products and smaller non-recurring items.

  PART I - ITEM 2

  FINANCIAL CONDITION and RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 

Operating income during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $4 million  , or   5%  , to $64 million, and operating margin decreased 10 basis points from the prior year period to 19.3%. The decreases in operating income and operating margin were driven primarily by lower sales volumes in our commercial avionics and electronics business as well as a favorable prior year adjustment of $4 million related to the receipt of a TDSS production contract. These decreases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $5 million. 
    
  New orders   increased $28 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the timing of funding with government customers. New orders decreased $59 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to a significant TDSS production contract received during the second quarter of 2015 as well as the timing of government orders. 
    
  Power 
    
  The following tables summarize sales, operating income and margin, and new orders within the Power segment.   

Components of sales and operating income increase (decrease): 

Sales   in the Power segment are primarily to the power generation and naval defense markets.   
  Sales in the   third quarter   increased   $2 million  , or   2%  , to $117 million, from the prior year period, primarily due to higher sales in the naval defense market. This increase is primarily due to higher development sales of pumps and generators of $4 million supporting the new Ohio-class replacement submarine program and higher production levels of $4 million on the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launching System (EMALS) program. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of $6 million of CVN-79 pumps and valves as production is nearing completion. Within the power generation market, sales decreased due to lower aftermarket sales of $10 million supporting domestic and international nuclear operating reactors. This decline was mostly offset by higher production levels on the AP1000 programs.   
    
  Sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $2 million  , or less than 1%, to $370 million from the prior year period, primarily due to lower sales of $7 million in the power generation market. This decrease is primarily due to lower aftermarket sales of $20 million supporting domestic nuclear operating reactors which was partially offset by higher production levels on the AP1000 program of $14 million. Within the naval defense market, sales increased $5 million primarily due to higher sales of pumps and generators of $14 million supporting the new Ohio-class replacement submarine program and higher

production levels of $4 million on the EMALS program, partially offset by lower sales of $13 million of CVN-79 pumps and valves as production is nearing completion. 
    
  Operating income   in the   third quarter   of   2016   increased   $1 million  , or   4%  , to $14 million, and operating margin increased 30 basis points from the prior year period to 12.0%. The increases in operating income and operating margin were driven primarily by higher sales volumes and lower costs on the AP1000 program, partially offset by lower operating income due to lower sales volumes supporting domestic nuclear operating reactors. 
    
  Operating income during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $10 million  , or   30%  , to   $45 million  , and operating margin increased 280 basis points from the prior year period to 12.1%. The increases in operating income and operating margin were driven by higher sales volumes and lower costs on the AP1000 program. Additionally, in the prior period we recorded an unfavorable contract adjustment of $11.5 million that was partially offset by a one-time net benefit of $7 million due to the receipt of a termination change order on the former Progress Energy AP1000 plant. These increases were partially offset by lower operating income due to the unfavorable impact of lower sales volumes supporting domestic nuclear operating reactors.  
    
  New orders   decreased $25 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the timing of funding for pumps and generators with government customers. New orders increased $29 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to an order placed during the current period for the purchase of pumps by a commercial customer and the timing of funding of government orders.

Sales during the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $4 million  , or 2%, to $202 million against the prior year period, primarily due to higher sales supporting the Phalanx close-in weapon system to the naval defense market.     This increase was partially offset by lower sales of embedded computing products to the aerospace defense market. 
    
  Sales during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $1 million  , or less than 1%, to $580 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower sales in the aerospace defense and ground defense markets. The decrease in sales in the aerospace defense market is primarily due to lower foreign military sales.  The decrease in sales in the ground defense market is primarily to lower sales of TDSS products on international ground defense platforms, partially offset by increased sales of embedded computing products on the G/ATOR program. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales in naval defense primarily related to the development phase of the Ohio replacement submarine program. 
    
  Commercial markets    
  Sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased     $23 million  , or 7%, to $305 million, from the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the general industrial market as a result of reduced sales of our severe-service industrial valves and industrial vehicle products.  
    
  Sales during the first nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $72 million, or 7%, to $964 million from the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the general industrial and power generation markets. Lower sales in the general industrial market were primarily a result of reduced sales of our severe-service industrial valves and industrial vehicle, medical mobility, and industrial automation products. Lower sales in the power generation market were primarily attributable to lower aftermarket sales supporting domestic nuclear operating reactors, partially offset by higher production levels on the AP1000 programs. These decreases were partially offset due to increased sales in the commercial aerospace market from higher sales of actuation and sensors and control products, primarily to Boeing. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Sources and Use of Cash 
    
  We derive the majority of our operating cash inflow from receipts on the sale of goods and services and cash outflow for the procurement of materials and labor; cash flow is therefore subject to market fluctuations and conditions. Most of our long-term contracts allow for several billing points (progress or milestone) that provide us with cash receipts as costs are incurred throughout the project rather than upon contract completion, thereby reducing working capital requirements. In some cases, these payments can exceed the costs incurred on a project. Management continually evaluates cash utilization alternatives, including share repurchases, acquisitions, increased dividends, and paying down debt, to determine the most beneficial use of available capital resources.  We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, available borrowings under the credit facility, and ability to raise additional capital through the credit markets, are sufficient to meet both the short-term and long-term capital needs of the organization. 

Net cash provided by operating activities     increased     $272 million   from the prior year period.  The   increase   was primarily due to a voluntary pension contribution of $145 million made during the first quarter of 2015.  The remaining   increase   in cash from operating activities is primarily due to net collections in   2016   related to the AP1000 program of   $97 million  , and a one-time   $20 million   benefit as a result of the interest rate swap termination.

  PART I - ITEM 2 
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION and ANALYSIS of 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION and RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 

Net cash used for investing activities   increased     $25 million   from the prior year period.  Cash provided by investing activities in   2015   benefited from cash received from divestitures of   $37 million  , partially offset by cash used for acquisitions of   $13 million  .  Capital expenditures of   $26 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were relatively consistent with the prior year period. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Debt  
    
  The Corporation s debt outstanding had an average interest rate of   4.0%   and   3.9%   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as compared to an average interest rate of   3.3%   for the comparable periods ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in average interest rates on the Corporation s outstanding debt is primarily attributable to the termination of our interest rate swaps in February 2016.  The Corporation s average debt outstanding for both the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $950 million  , as compared to   $953 million   and   $957 million  , respectively in the comparable periods ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Revolving Credit Agreement 
    
  As of the end of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation had no outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (the  Credit Agreement  or  credit facility ) and   $37 million   in letters of credit supported by the credit facility.  The unused credit available under the Credit Agreement at   September 30, 2016   was   $463 million  , which could be borrowed without violating any of our debt covenants. 
    
  Repurchase of common stock 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Corporation used   $80 million   of cash to repurchase approximately   1,035,000   outstanding shares under its share repurchase program.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Corporation used   $185 million   of cash to repurchase approximately   2,665,000   outstanding shares. 
    
  Dividends 
    
  The Corporation made dividend payments of   $12 million   during each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. 
    
  Debt Compliance 
    
  As of the date of this report, we were in compliance with all debt agreements and credit facility covenants, including our most restrictive covenant, which is our debt to capitalization limit of 60%.  The debt to capitalization limit is a measure of our indebtedness (as defined per the notes purchase agreement and credit facility) to capitalization, where capitalization equals debt plus equity, and is the same for and applies to all of our debt agreements and credit facility.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the ability to borrow additional debt of   $834 million   without violating our debt to capitalization covenant.   

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses.  These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies.  Critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.  A summary of significant accounting policies and a description of accounting policies that are considered critical may be found in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2016, in the Notes to the  
  Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, and the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Item 3.                      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  There has been no material changes in our market risk during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Information regarding market risk and market risk management policies is more fully described in item  7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 4.                      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of   September 30, 2016   insofar as they are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and they include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
    
  Item 1.                     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various pending claims, lawsuits, and contingent liabilities. We do not believe that the disposition of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In December 2013, the Corporation, along with other unaffiliated parties, received a claim from Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) filed in the Court of Queen s Bench of Alberta, Judicial District of Calgary.  The claim pertains to a January 2011 fire and explosion at a delayed coker unit at its Fort McMurray refinery that resulted in the injury of five CNRL employees, damage to property and equipment, and various forms of consequential loss such as loss of profit, lost opportunities, and business interruption.  The fire and explosion occurred when a CNRL employee bypassed certain safety controls and opened an operating coker unit. The total quantum of alleged damages arising from the incident has not been finalized, but is estimated to meet or exceed $1 billion.  The Corporation maintains various forms of commercial, property and casualty, product liability, and other forms of insurance; however, such insurance may not be adequate to cover the costs associated with a judgment against us. The Corporation is currently unable to estimate an amount, or range of potential losses, if any, from this matter. The Corporation believes it has adequate legal defenses and intends to defend this matter vigorously.  The Corporation s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, could be materially affected during a future fiscal quarter or fiscal year by unfavorable developments or outcome regarding this claim.  
    
  We or our subsidiaries have been named in a number of lawsuits that allege injury from exposure to asbestos.  To date, neither we nor our subsidiaries have been found liable or paid any material sum of money in settlement in any case.  We believe that the minimal use of asbestos in our past and current operations and the relatively non-friable condition of asbestos in our products makes it unlikely that we will face material liability in any asbestos litigation, whether individually or in the aggregate.  We maintain insurance coverage for these potential liabilities and believe adequate coverage exists to cover any unanticipated asbestos liability. 

Item 1A.          RISK FACTORS 
    
  There has been no material changes in our Risk Factors during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Information regarding our Risk Factors is more fully described in Item  1A. Risk Factors  of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 2.            UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
    
  The following table provides information about our repurchase of equity securities that are registered by us pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 

On December 9, 2015, the Corporation announced its newly authorized $200 million share repurchase program.  The Company initiated the new program in January 2016 and plans to repurchase at least $100 million of shares in 2016. Under the current  
  
   Page   31 

program, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

  There have been no material changes in our procedures by which our security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Information regarding security holder recommendations and nominations for directors is more fully described in the section entitled  Stockholder Recommendations and Nominations for Director  of our   2016   Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, which is incorporated by reference to our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.
