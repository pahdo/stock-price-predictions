This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words:  anticipate,   believe,   continue,   could,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   ongoing,   plan,   potential,   predict,   project,   should,   will,   would,  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report. These factors include, among others:           our ability to raise capital;       our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets;       our ability to successfully execute acquisitions on favorable terms;       declines in general economic conditions in the markets where we may compete;       unknown environmental liabilities associated with any companies we may acquire; and       significant competition in the markets where we may operate.       You should read any other cautionary statements made in this Quarterly Report as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Quarterly Report. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate, and therefore, prospective investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. You should read this Quarterly Report completely, and it should be considered in light of all other information contained in the reports or registration statement that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), including all risk factors outlined therein. Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future.            3              JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STARTUPS ACT DISCLOSURE    We qualify as an  emerging growth company,  as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the  JOBS Act ). An issuer qualifies as an  emerging growth company  if it has total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year, and will continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:                                    the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more;                                       the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement;                                        the date on which the issuer has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or                                       the date on which the issuer is deemed to be a  large accelerated filer,  as defined in Section 240.12b-2 of the Exchange Act.          As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from various reporting requirements. Specifically, we are exempt from the following provisions:                                    Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires evaluations and reporting related to an issuer s internal controls;                                       Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires an issuer to seek shareholder approval of the compensation of its executives not less frequently than once every three years; and                                       Section 14A(b) of the Exchange Act, which requires an issuer to seek shareholder approval of its so-called  golden parachute  compensation, or compensation upon termination of an employee s employment.          Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.        PART I  FINANCIAL INFORMATION          Item 1.  Financial Statements         The Financial Statements of the Company required to be filed with this 10-Q Quarterly Report were prepared by management and commence below, together with related notes. In the opinion of management, the Financial Statements fairly present the financial position of the Company.         4            
                                                                                                                      F-1                    GEO POINT RESOURCES, INC.     BALANCE SHEETS     (unaudited)          
          The accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.           F-2                       GEO POINT RESOURCES, INC.     STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS     (unaudited)          
                                                      The accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.       F-3                       GEO POINT RESOURCES, INC.     STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS     (unaudited)          
                                  The accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.           F-4                     
     GEO POINT RESOURCES, INC.     NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (unaudited)         NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS        On June 13, 2012, the Board of Directors of Geo Point Technologies, Inc., a Utah corporation ( Geo Point Utah ), approved a stock dividend that resulted in a spin-off ( Spin-Off ) of Geo Point Resources, Inc. (the  Company ) common stock to the Geo Point Utah stockholders, pro rata, on the record date (the  Record Date ). Prior to the Spin-Off, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Geo Point Utah. The Company was incorporated on June 13, 2012, comprising all of Geo Point Utah s Environmental and Engineering Divisions  assets, business, operations, rights or otherwise, along with its  Hydrocarbon Identification Technology  License Agreement with William C. Lachmar dated January 31, 2008.  The Spin-Off had a  Record Date  of January 17, 2013; an ex-dividend date of January 15, 2013; and a Spin-Off payment date of April 22, 2013.        NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES         Going Concern        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company has incurred significant current period losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, has negative working capital, an accumulated deficit, and a revolving line of credit from a third party in order to fund its operations. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding these matters, if needed, include raising additional debt or equity financing. The terms of which might not be acceptable to the Company. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.        Interim Financial Statements        The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  The accompanying balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, and the statements of operations and cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for such periods.  The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the financial statements related to the three and six month periods are unaudited. The results of the six months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending March 31, 2017, any other interim period, or any other future year.        Use of Estimates        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts and the useful life of property and equipment.        Fair Value of Financial Instruments        The Company complies with the accounting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements,  as well as certain related FASB staff positions.  This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact business and considers assumptions that marketplace participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.             F-5         The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows:             Level 1     quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.             Level 2     inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.               Level 3     unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.         As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company did not have Level 1, 2, or 3 financial assets or liabilities. Financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, payables, and a line of credit.  The fair value of financial instruments approximated their carrying values as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, due to the short-term nature of these items.         Concentration of Credit Risks and Customer Concentrations        During the six months ended September 30, 2016, services provided to two customers accounted for 80.7% (related party) and 12.4% of total revenues.  During the six months ended September 30, 2015, services provided to two customers accounted for 64.3% and 18.7% of total revenues.  One of these customers is considered a related party, see Note 6. Management believes the loss of these customers would have a material impact on the Company.        Revenue Recognition        The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized and earned.  The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when: (1) it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) services have been rendered and are invoiced; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.        The Company s primary source of revenue has been in its environmental division, providing historical site data searches, preliminary investigation and drilling, site characterization modeling, regulatory agency liaison, and full environmental clean-ups using such methods as vapor extraction, air sparging, bio-remediation, ORC (Oxygen Release Compound) and HRC (Hydrogen Release Compound) injection treatment, air stripping, and ionic exchange.  Revenues from providing historical site data searches, preliminary investigation and drilling, site characterization modeling, regulatory agency liaison, and full environmental clean-ups using such methods as vapor extraction, air sparging, bio-remediation, ORC (Oxygen Release Compound) and HRC (Hydrogen Release Compound) injection treatment, air stripping, and ionic exchange are recognized after services have been performed.  The Company also has operations associated with the oil and gas segment that have limited activity and have not yet generated revenues.  All revenues are reported inclusive of shipping and handling costs billed and exclusive of any taxes billed to customers, if any.  Shipping and handling costs incurred, if any, are reported in cost of products sold.       See Note 6 for revenue transactions with a related party.        Basic and Diluted (Income) Loss per Common Share        Basic income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted income (loss) per common share reflects the potential dilution to basic earnings per share that could occur upon conversion or exercise of securities, options, or other such items to common shares using the treasury stock method, based upon the weighted average fair value of the Company s common shares during the period. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any dilutive securities.                F-6          NOTE 3   FINANCIAL STATEMENT ELEMENTS         Loans Receivable   Construction Project        In July 2015, the Company loaned $75,000 to an unrelated third party. The loan does not incur interest and is due on demand. The loan is intended to be a short term loan used for a construction project by the borrower.       On November 9, 2015, the Company loaned $100,000 to an unrelated third party.  The loan incurs interest at 2% per annum and is due upon the earlier of October 31, 2018, or completion by the borrower of one or more projects having an aggregate value of not less than $40 million. The loan is intended to be a short term bridge loan used for working capital for the third party.        Property and Equipment        Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are comprised of the following at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016:             Depreciation expense for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $500 and $500, respectively.        NOTE 4   LINE OF CREDIT AND SHORT TERM ADVANCES         On January 1, 2013, the Company entered into a $100,000 revolving line of credit with a third party.  Under the terms of the agreement the outstanding principal incurs interest at 24% per annum with principal and interest due six months from the date of the agreement or July 1, 2013.  The revolving line of credit is unsecured and currently in default; however, no demands for repayment have been made. Subsequent to the agreement date, the third party has continued to advance additional funds as needed under the same terms of the initial revolving line of credit.  Proceeds from the revolving line of credit were used for operations.  As of September 30, 2016, the revolving line of credit had a principal and an accrued interest balance of $252,760 and $140,014, respectively. As of March 31, 2016, the revolving line of credit had a principal and an accrued interest balance of $222,160 and $111,478, respectively.       During the six months ended September 30, 2016, two individuals advanced the Company a total of $40,000. The advances do not incur interest and are due on demand.  The proceeds were used to purchase drilling equipment, which was used on one of the Company's jobs.         NOTE 5   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES        In November 2013, the Company was notified from a group insurance policy that projects in which the Company previously provided services to was in litigation due to defects within the projects. The group policy claimed that the Company owed $75,000 in deductibles in connection with this litigation.  The Company maintained that they were not involved with the areas in which the suit is being bought, and did not op for the group insurance and thus are not liable for any of the deductible amounts. However, in March 2015, the Company agreed to settle the claim for $5,000, in which was paid immediately and included within general and administrative expenses during the year ended March 31, 2015.        NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION        During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded revenues of $103,812 and $0 for services performed for an entity partially owned by the Company s Chief Executive Officer, respectively. The Company performs engineering services for the related entity and bills its services based upon time and expenses incurred. The Company s management maintains that the fees charged to the related party are no less favorable than would be charged to unrelated parties for similar services.            F-7          Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.         Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements        This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements based on management s beliefs, assumptions and plans for the future, information currently available to management and other statements that are not historical in nature.  Forward-looking statements include statements in which words such as  expect,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,   believe,  estimate,   consider,  or similar expressions are used.  These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among others: a general economic downturn; a downturn in the securities markets; regulations that affect trading in the securities of  penny stocks  the enactment of United States or foreign laws, rules and regulations that could have a materially adverse impact on current and intended operations; and other risks and uncertainties.  For additional forward-looking statement information, see the heading  Forward-Looking Statements  at the forepart of this Quarterly Report on page 3.       Our future results and stockholder values may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond our ability to control or predict.  We may be required to update these forward-looking statements from time to time as circumstances change.         References to  we,   our  or  us  and words of similar import under this heading refer to  Geo Point Nevada,  unless the context implies otherwise.        Plan of Operation        Our business is primarily comprised of services related to identifying any recognized environmental condition ( REC ) or the lack thereof as provided by the federal, state or local governmental agencies in any real property of any owner, potential owner or lender, governmental agency or other person that may have a concern or may have or be seeking an interest in the subject property.  Once our services are engaged, we contract with a drilling company to drill into the ground locations selected by us to collect a physical soil sample; if the project is small and can be handled by our smaller drilling equipment, this service is not contracted out.  Once the soil sample is obtained, it is submitted to a State of California certified laboratory for analysis of the existence of hazardous materials.  Based upon the laboratory s analysis, William C. Lachmar, our President, who is a Licensed Professional Geologist in Texas and California, prepares a written report that is sanctioned by the particular laboratory that conducted the analysis. Mr. Lachmar s licensing as a  Professional Geologist  is a requirement to prepare any such report.  If an REC is identified to exist, then we will provide project management and engineering conclusions and recommendations necessary to remediate the property and bring it back into regulatory compliance based upon the California tables of acceptable levels of product contamination.  Acceptable levels are further qualified based upon residential, commercial and industrial zoned properties, with the residential levels being the most stringent.  Examples of contaminations that result in concern include those that are inadvertently or otherwise inoculated into the shallow subsurface soils or groundwater, like gasoline, diesel fuel, dry cleaning fluid, rocket fuel, arsenic, mercury, lead and other toxic substances.  These services are basically the same in each project: examine the property; drill or have it drilled for soil samples; submit the soil samples to a State of California certified laboratory; prepare a report on the soil samples; and if an REC is found to exist, provide the described services, directly or through subcontractors, by or under the supervision of Mr. Lachmar.  Sometimes, we merely assess the environmental impact of any hazardous materials found and prepare the requested report.         We have provided consulting and compliance services for new utility installation and general site erosion control for housing tracts and updating service station underground storage tanks and fuel dispensing systems to comply with continually changing California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) regulations.  Other engineering services provided are for soil dewatering for underground structure installations and small demolition and construction work.  These  utility landing  services comprise subsurface trench work where underground utilities are installed such as electrical, fiber optic, water and gas.  The other engineering services are for gasoline service stations where updated monitoring equipment must be installed or the monitoring equipment shows an error code that needs to be corrected before the gas station can begin to pump gas again; or where more crash posts must be installed around a propane tank, other fuel or similar dispenser island or a like setting.  Other engineering services are to plan and construct dewatering systems for the install of subsurface structures such as underground parking lots, underground storage tanks, etc. that are placed within a shallow groundwater zone and must be dewatered prior to construction, and  closure  of underground water treatment systems where a manufacturing plant has underground processed water systems that treat their production waste water streams prior to discharge to the common sewer system.  Light construction work consists of tenant improvement build-outs and small     12              American Disabilities Act (ADA), compliance issues such as wheelchair access ramp construction, hand rail design and installation, parking area upgrades and other related matters.        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations          Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had sales of $77,049, compared to $28,954 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $48,095.  Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $37,900, compared to $7,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $30,800.  Cost of sales increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016, due primarily to an increase in revenues. The gross profit percentage decreased during the current year due to additional costs incurred for contract work paid to third parties for their assistance, and in the previous period, this assistance was not needed.  In addition, during fiscal 2016, 68% of our sales were generated from a related party entity whereby none were generated in the prior comparable period. We have seen an increase in the need for our services due to increased activity in the construction industry in Southern California.  However, we are continuing to see significant pressure on fees within our industry due to competition.        General and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, were $61,513, compared to $37,112, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $24,401.  The increase in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, was directly related to additional compensation of $10,500 paid to our Chief Executive Officer and the additional costs related to an additional administrative position.         Six months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to the Six months Ended September 30, 2015        During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we had sales of $128,579, compared to $55,419 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $73,160.  Cost of sales for the six months ended September 30, 2016, was $55,569, compared to $12,611 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $42,958.  Cost of sales increased during the six months ended September 30, 2016, due primarily to an increase in revenues. The gross profit percentage decreased during the current year due to additional costs incurred for contract work paid to third parties for their assistance, and in the previous period, this assistance was not needed.  In addition, during fiscal 2016, 81% of our sales were generated from a related party entity whereby none were generated in the prior comparable period. We have seen an increase in the need for our services due to increased activity in the construction industry in Southern California.  However, we are continuing to see significant pressure on fees within our industry due to competition.        General and administrative expenses during the six months ended September 30, 2016, were $123,722, compared to $70,342, during the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $53,380.  The increase in general and administrative expenses during the six months ended September 30, 2016, was directly related to additional compensation of $25,500 paid to our Chief Executive Officer and the additional costs related to an additional administrative position.         Liquidity        Current assets at September 30, 2016, included cash of $4,274.  At September 30, 2016, we had a negative working capital of $431,315, as compared a negative working capital of $288,687 at March 31, 2016.  The negative working capital at September 30, 2016, is a result of the historical net losses incurred by the Company, as revenues, at times, are still not sufficient to cover our minimum operating costs.        Capital Resources        During the six months ended September 30, 2016, operating activities used cash of $34,812 compared to $26,305 net cash used in the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $8,507. The increase was primary related to the current period net loss due to the additional compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer. We funded operations during the six months ended September 30, 2016, primarily through operations, the use of cash on hand and proceeds from a line of credit.       During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we used cash in investing of activities of $63,880 due to the purchase of drilling equipment and vehicles to be used in our operations. During the six months ended September 30, 2015, we used cash in investing of activities of $62,255 of which $60,000 related to a loan to a third party.        13                  During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we received cash from financing activities of $70,600 from proceeds on a line of credit of $30,600 and $40,000 advanced from two third parties to which was used to purchase the equipment discussed in investing activities. $30,000 provided by the line of credit for the six months ended September 30, 2015.       We intend to fund future operations for the next 12 months through cash flows generated from operations and current cash on hand.  These contributions are expected to satisfy amounts in accounts payable and potentially be used for operations. If these cash flows are not sufficient to fund operations, we may be required to raise capital through either a debt or equity financing.  Currently, we cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.  If, after utilizing the existing sources of capital available to us, further capital needs are identified and if we are not successful in obtaining the required financing, we may be forced to curtail our existing or planned future operations.  We believe our plans will enable us to continue our current operations for in excess of one year from the date of financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements        We had no off balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.         Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.         Not required.        Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.          Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures         Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.        Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, and provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules, regulations and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.         Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting         Our management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has concluded there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.          14                   PART II - OTHER INFORMATION          Item 1. Legal Proceedings.         None; not applicable.         Item 1A.  Risk Factors.        Not required; however, for potential risk factors that may still be applicable to the Company, see the Prospectus regarding our Spin-Off that was filed with the SEC on January 8, 2013.         Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.         None; not applicable.          Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.         None; not applicable.          Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.        None, not applicable.         Item 5. Other Information.          None; not applicable.         Item 6. Exhibits.
