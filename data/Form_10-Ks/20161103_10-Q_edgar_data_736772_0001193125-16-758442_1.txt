1.   
   BASIS OF PRESENTATION         The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the SEC and in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Because this report is based on an
interim period, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted.      In the opinion of management of the registrant, the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial condition and the results of operations for the periods presented. The financial performance reported for CNB Financial
Corporation (the  Corporation ) for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. This information should be read in conjunction with the
Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015. All dollar amounts are stated in thousands, except share and per share data and other amounts as indicated. Certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.       

2.   
   BUSINESS COMBINATION         On July 15, 2016,
the Corporation completed its previously announced acquisition of Lake National Bank ( LNB ) of Mentor, Ohio for $22.50 per share in cash, resulting in consideration paid to LNB shareholders of $24.75 million. Following completion of
the merger, the two branches of LNB in Mentor, Ohio are operating as part of the ERIEBANK division of CNB Bank.     As disclosed in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income, the Corporation incurred merger costs of $266 thousand and $481 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. All merger costs have been expensed as incurred.   
  The following table summarizes the consideration paid for LNB and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed that were recognized at the
acquisition date:       
 
         6   

Table of Contents  

   Valuation of some assets acquired or created including, but not limited to, goodwill are preliminary and
could be subject to change.      Included in accrued interest receivable and other assets is a deferred tax asset of $249 which represents the tax
effect of temporary differences between the tax basis and fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities.      Acquired loans were recorded at
fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. Determining the fair value of loans involved estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those
cash flows at a market rate of interest. The Corporation acquired $126,134 of gross loans and recognized a net combined yield and credit mark of $4,098.      Goodwill of $11,773 arising from the acquisition consisted largely of synergies and the cost savings resulting from the combining of the operations of the Corporation and Lake National Bank. None of the
goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.       

3.   
   STOCK COMPENSATION         The Corporation has a
stock incentive plan for key employees and independent directors. The stock incentive plan, which is administered by a committee of the Board of Directors, provides for aggregate grants of up to 500,000 shares of common stock in the form of
nonqualified options or restricted stock. For key employees, the plan vesting is one-fourth of the granted options or restricted stock per year beginning one year after the grant date, with 100% vested on the fourth anniversary of the grant date.
For independent directors, the vesting schedule is one-third of the granted options or restricted stock per year beginning one year after the grant date, with 100% vested on the third anniversary of the grant date.   
  At September 30, 2016, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under this plan and no stock options
were granted during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      Compensation expense for the restricted stock
awards is recognized over the requisite service period noted above based on the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. Nonvested restricted stock awards are recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital in shareholders  equity
until earned. Compensation expense resulting from these restricted stock awards was $216 and $628 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $169 and $474 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. As of
September 30, 2016, there was $1,359 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock awards to be recognized over the next five years.

4.   
   FAIR VALUE          Fair Value Measurement
      Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy has also been established which requires an entity to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:      Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.   
  Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted
prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.   
  Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability.      The fair values of most trading securities and securities available for sale are determined by
obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs) or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the
specific securities but rather relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs).      The
Corporation s structured pooled trust preferred securities are priced using Level 3 inputs. The decline in the level of observable inputs and market activity in this class of investments by the measurement date has been significant and resulted
in unreliable external pricing. Broker pricing and bid/ask spreads, when available, vary widely, and the once-active market has become comparatively inactive. The Corporation engaged a third party consultant who has developed a model for pricing
these securities. Information such as historical and current performance of the underlying collateral, deferral and default rates, collateral coverage ratios, break in yield calculations, cash flow projections, liquidity and credit premiums required

market participant, and financial trend analysis with respect to the individual issuing financial institutions and insurance companies are utilized in determining the security valuation. Due to
the current market conditions as well as the limited trading activity of these types of securities, the market value of the Corporation s structured pooled trust preferred securities are highly sensitive to assumption changes and market
volatility.      The Corporation s derivative instruments are interest rate swaps that are similar to those that trade in liquid markets. As
such, significant fair value inputs can generally be verified and do not typically involve significant management judgments (Level 2 inputs).   
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair
value measurement of the Corporation s pooled trust preferred securities are collateral default rate, yield, and prepayment speed. Significant increases in specific-issuer default assumptions or decreases in specific-issuer recovery assumptions
would result in a lower fair value measurement. Conversely, decreases in specific-issuer default assumptions or increases in specific-issuer recovery assumptions would result in a higher fair value measurement.   
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are as follows at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

    Impaired loans, measured for impairment using the fair value of collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a recorded
investment of $3,202 with a valuation allowance of $1,200 as of September 30, 2016, resulting in an additional negative provision for loan losses of $(95) and $(42) for the corresponding three and nine month period ended September 30,
2016. Impaired loans had a recorded investment of $3,489 with a valuation allowance of $1,242 as of December 31, 2015. Impaired loans carried at fair value resulted in an additional provision for loan losses of $(361) and $(298) for the
corresponding three and nine month period ended September 30, 2015.      The estimated fair values of impaired collateral dependent loans
such as commercial or residential mortgages are determined primarily through third-party appraisals. When a collateral dependent loan, such as a commercial or residential mortgage loan, becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an
updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary. This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, the loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal, and the condition of the
property. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral and a further reduction for estimated costs to sell the property is applied, which results in an amount that is considered to be the estimated fair
value. If a loan becomes impaired and the appraisal of related loan collateral is outdated, management applies an appropriate adjustment factor based on its experience with current valuations of similar collateral in determining the loan s
estimated fair value and resulting allowance for loan losses. Third-party appraisals are not customarily obtained in respect of unimpaired loans, unless in management s view changes in circumstances warrant obtaining an updated appraisal.

Table of Contents  

   The methods and assumptions, not otherwise presented, used to estimate fair values are described as follows:
      Cash and cash equivalents:  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair values and are classified as
Level 1.       Loans held for sale:  The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from
third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification.       Loans:  For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no
significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values, resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans
with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality, resulting in a Level 3 classification. Impaired loans are valued at the lower of cost or fair value as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not
necessarily represent an exit price.       FHLB and other equity interests:  It is not practical to determine the fair value of Federal Home
Loan Bank stock and other equity interests due to restrictions placed on the transferability of these instruments.       Accrued interest
receivable:  The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates fair value. The Level classification of accrued interest receivable is matched to the corresponding Level of the asset with which it is associated.   
   Deposits:  The fair values disclosed for demand deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e.,
their carrying amount), resulting in a Level 1 classification. Fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated
expected monthly maturities on time deposits, resulting in a Level 2 classification.       FHLB and other borrowings:  The fair values of the
Corporation s FHLB and other borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements, resulting in a Level 2 classification.   
   Subordinated debentures:  The fair value of the Corporation s subordinated debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based
on the current borrowing rates for similar types of arrangements, resulting in a Level 2 classification.       Accrued interest payable:  The
carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates fair value resulting in a classification that is consistent with the liability with which it is associated.      While estimates of fair value are based on management s judgment of the most appropriate factors as of the balance sheet date, there is no assurance that the estimated fair values would have been
realized if the assets had been disposed of or the liabilities settled at that date, since market values may differ depending on various circumstances. The estimated fair values would also not apply to subsequent dates.   
  In addition, other assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments, such as premises and equipment, are not included in the disclosures. Also,
non-financial assets such as, among other things, the estimated earning power of core deposits, the earnings potential of trust accounts, the trained workforce, and customer goodwill, which typically are not recognized on the balance sheet, may have
value but are not included in the fair value disclosures.

    The Corporation evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, or more frequently when
economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation.      A roll-forward of the other-than-temporary impairment amount related to credit

During the quarter ended June 30, 2016 the Corporation sold two structured pooled trust preferred securities which
had been charged off in their entirety in prior periods. The original cost basis of these securities was $1,983 and the proceeds received totaled $922, which is reported in net realized gains on available-for-sale securities for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016. Due to the insignificance of the Corporation s adjusted amortized cost balance of the remaining structured pooled trust securities, no further disclosures are required.   
  For the securities that comprise corporate notes and bonds and the securities that are issued by state and political subdivisions, management monitors
publicly available financial information, such as filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in order to evaluate the securities for other-than-temporary impairment. For financial institution issuers, management monitors information from
quarterly  call  report filings that are used to generate Uniform Bank Performance Reports. All other securities that were in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date were reviewed by management, and issuer-specific documents
were reviewed, as appropriate given the following considerations. When reviewing securities for other-than-temporary impairment, management considers the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether downgrades by bond rating
agencies have occurred. Management also considers the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than cost, and whether management does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that it will not be required to
sell the securities before their anticipated recovery.      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management concluded that
the securities described in the previous paragraph were not other-than-temporarily impaired for the following reasons:       

There is no indication of any significant deterioration of the creditworthiness of the institutions that issued the securities.

All contractual interest payments on the securities have been received as scheduled, and no information has come to management s attention through
the processes previously described which would lead to a conclusion that future contractual payments will not be timely received.         The Corporation does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis.

    The following is a schedule of the contractual maturity of securities available for sale, excluding equity securities, at
September 30, 2016:       
    Mortgage and asset backed securities and pooled SBA securities are not due at a single date; periodic payments are
received based on the payment patterns of the underlying collateral.      On September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, securities
carried at $347,196 and $312,669, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes as provided by law.       
    Total net loans at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:       
    At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, net unamortized loan fees of $(824) and $(636), respectively, have
been included in the carrying value of loans.      The Bank attempts to limit concentrations within specific industries by utilizing dollar
limitations to single industries or customers, and by entering into participation agreements with third parties. Collateral requirements are established based on management s assessment of the customer. The Corporation maintains lending
policies to control the quality of the loan portfolio. These policies delegate the authority to extend loans under specific guidelines and underwriting standards. These policies are prepared by the Corporation s management and reviewed and
ratified annually by the Corporation s Board of Directors.   
         16   

Table of Contents  

   All relevant documentation, such as the loan application, financial statements and tax returns, required
under the lending policies is summarized and provided to management and/or the Corporation s Board of Directors in connection with the loan approval process. Such documentation is subsequently electronically archived in the Corporation s
document management system. Pursuant to the Corporation s lending policies, management considers a variety of factors when determining whether to extend credit to a customer, including loan-to-value ratios, FICO scores, quality of the
borrower s financial statements, and the ability to obtain personal guarantees.      Commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans comprised
32% and 30% of the Corporation s total loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Commercial mortgage loans comprised 28% of the Corporation s total loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. Management assigns a risk rating to all commercial loans at loan origination. The loan-to-value policy guidelines for commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans are generally a maximum of 80% of the value of business equipment, a maximum
of 75% of the value of accounts receivable, and a maximum of 60% of the value of business inventory. The loan-to-value policy guideline for commercial mortgage loans is generally a maximum of 85% of the appraised value of the real estate.
     Residential real estate loans comprised 36% of the Corporation s total loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. The loan-to-value policy guidelines for residential real estate loans vary depending on the collateral position and the specific type of loan. Higher loan-to-value terms may be approved with the appropriate private mortgage insurance coverage.
The Corporation also originates and prices loans for sale into the secondary market through Freddie Mac. Loans originated for sale into the secondary market are classified as loans held for sale and are excluded from residential real estate loans
reported above. The rationale for these sales is to mitigate interest rate risk associated with holding lower rate, long-term residential mortgages in the loan portfolio and to generate fee revenue from sales and servicing the loan. The Corporation
also offers a variety of unsecured and secured consumer loan and credit card products which represent less than 10% of the total loan portfolio at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Terms and collateral requirements vary
depending on the size and nature of the loan.      CNB has not underwritten any hybrid loans, payment option loans, or low documentation/no
documentation loans. Variable rate loans are generally underwritten at the fully indexed rate. Loan underwriting policies and procedures have not changed materially between any periods presented.

    Nonaccrual loans and loans past due over 90 days still on accrual include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are
collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans.      Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the
obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time (generally six months) and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

     Troubled Debt Restructurings       The terms of certain loans have been modified as troubled debt restructurings. The modification of the terms of such loans included either or both of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate
of the loan or an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk.      The following table presents the number of loans, loan balances, and specific reserves for loans that have been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015.       
    The following table present loans by class modified as troubled debt restructurings that occurred during the nine months

   A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified
terms. All loans modified in troubled debt restructurings are performing in accordance with their modified terms as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and no principal balances were forgiven in connection with the loan
restructurings.      In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Corporation performs an evaluation using
its internal underwriting policies of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without a loan modification. The Corporation has no further loan commitments to customers whose loans are
classified as a troubled debt restructuring.       Credit Quality Indicators       The Corporation classifies commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans and commercial mortgage loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their
debt, such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Loans with outstanding balances greater than $1 million are analyzed at least
semiannually and loans with outstanding balances of less than $1 million are analyzed at least annually.      The Corporation uses the following
definitions for risk ratings:      Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves
management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Corporation s credit position at some future date.   
  Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of
the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the
deficiencies are not corrected.      Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as
substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.   
  Loans not rated as special mention, substandard, or doubtful are considered to be pass rated loans. All loans included in the following tables have been
assigned a risk rating within 12 months of the balance sheet date.       September 30, 2016

   The Corporation considers the performance of the loan portfolio and its impact on the allowance for loan
losses. For residential real estate, consumer, and credit card loan classes, the Corporation also evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan, which was previously presented, and by payment activity. The following table presents
the recorded investment in residential, consumer, and credit card loans based on payment activity as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       
    The Corporation s portfolio of residential real estate and consumer loans maintained within Holiday Financial
Services Corporation ( Holiday ) are considered to be subprime loans. Holiday is a subsidiary that offers small balance unsecured and secured loans primarily collateralized by automobiles and equipment, to borrowers with higher risk
characteristics than are typical in the Bank s consumer loan portfolio.      Holiday s loan portfolio is summarized as follows at

   EARNINGS PER SHARE         Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the applicable period, excluding outstanding participating securities. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of
shares determined for the basic computation plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares issuable under certain stock compensation plans. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no outstanding stock
options to include in the diluted earnings per share calculations.

   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS         On May 3,
2011, the Corporation executed an interest rate swap agreement with a 5 year term and an effective date of September 15, 2013 in order to hedge cash flows associated with $10 million of a subordinated note that was issued by the Corporation
during 2007 and elected cash flow hedge accounting for the agreement. The Corporation s objective in using this derivative is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The interest rate swap involves
the receipt of variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments from September 15, 2013 to September 15, 2018 without exchange of the underlying notional amount. At September 30, 2016, the variable rate on the subordinated
debt was 2.40% (LIBOR plus 155 basis points) and the Corporation was paying 5.57% (4.02% fixed rate plus 155 basis points).      As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no derivatives were designated as fair value hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Additionally, the Corporation does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes
and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.

  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the interest rate swap will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments
are made on the subordinated debentures. Such amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense in the next twelve months are expected to be $337. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, a cash
collateral balance in the amount of $1,400 was maintained with a counterparty to the interest rate swaps. These balances are included in interest bearing deposits with other banks on the consolidated balance sheet.

   The Corporation has entered into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging
instruments. These derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Corporation enters into an interest rate swap with a customer while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution. In
connection with each swap transaction, the Corporation agrees to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the customer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate.
Concurrently, the Corporation agrees to pay another financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. The transaction allows the Corporation s
customers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. Because the Corporation acts as an intermediary for its customer, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts offset each other and do not impact the
Corporation s results of operations.      The Corporation pledged cash collateral to another financial institution with a balance of $200 as
of September 30, 2016. This balance is included in interest bearing deposits with other banks on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation does not require its customers to post cash or securities as collateral on its program of
back-to-back swaps. However, certain language is included in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement and loan documents where, in default situations, the Corporation is permitted to access collateral supporting the loan
relationship to recover any losses suffered on the derivative asset or liability. The Corporation may be required to post additional collateral to swap counterparties in the future in proportion to potential increases in unrealized loss positions.
     The following table provides summary information about the amounts and locations of activity related to the back-to-back interest rate swaps
within the Corporation s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS         In
August 2016, the FASB issued an update (ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows) which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are
presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities, including business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows, and are effective for
public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to
have a material effect on the Corporation s financial statements.      In June 2016, the FASB issued an update (ASU 2016-13, Financial
Instruments   Credit Losses) which will require recognition of an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses for assets measured at amortized cost. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 eliminate the probable initial recognition
threshold in current U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In addition, the amendments in ASU 2016-13 broaden the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either
collectively or individually, such as loans. The update will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on the Corporation s financial statements.   
         26   

Table of Contents  

   In March 2016, the FASB issued an update (ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting) which will require recognition of the income tax effects of share-based awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled (i.e., Additional Paid-in-Capital pools will be eliminated). The
guidance in this ASU will become effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 is not expected to have a material effect on the
Corporation s financial statements.      In March 2016, the FASB issued an update (ASU 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging: Contingent Put and
Call Options in Debt Instruments) which clarifies that an assessment of whether an embedded contingent put or call option is clearly and closely related to the debt host requires only an analysis of the four-step decision sequence in ASC
815-15-25-42. Entities are required to apply the guidance to existing debt instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt host) using a modified retrospective transition method as of the period of adoption. The
guidance in this ASU will become effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-06 is not expected to have a material effect on the
Corporation s financial statements.      In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,  Leases (Topic
842) . ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities that arise from all leases. In addition, lessor accounting guidance will be changed to conform to the new guidance. The update will be effective for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Corporation s financial statements.   
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities . ASU 2016-01 provides updated accounting and reporting requirements for both public and non-public entities. The most significant provisions that will impact the Corporation are: 1) equity securities available for sale will be
measured at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized in the income statement; 2) eliminate the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for
financial instruments at amortized cost on the balance sheet; 3) utilization of exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; 4) require separate presentation of both financial assets and
liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or accompanying notes to the financial statements. The update will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
using a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the year adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Corporation s financial
statements.      In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-12,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic
718) . ASU 2014-12 clarifies that entities should treat performance targets that can be met after the requisite service period of a share-based payment award as performance conditions that affect vesting. Therefore, an entity would not record
compensation expense (measured as of the grant date without taking into account the effect of the performance target) related to an award for which transfer to the employee is contingent on the entity s satisfaction of a performance target
until it becomes probable that the performance target will be met. No new disclosures are required under ASU 2014-12. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 did not have a
material effect on the Corporation s financial statements.      In May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  The ASU creates a new topic, Topic 606, to provide guidance on revenue recognition for entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enter into contracts for the
transfer of nonfinancial assets. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additional disclosures are required to provide quantitative and qualitative information regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
with customers. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the
impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Corporation s financial statements.

Pennsylvania counties of Blair, Cambria, Cameron, Centre, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Indiana, Jefferson, and McKean. As ERIEBANK, a division of CNB Bank, the Bank operates in the Pennsylvania counties of Crawford, Erie, and Warren, and the Ohio
counties of Ashtabula and Lake. As FCBank, a division of CNB Bank, the Bank operates in the Ohio counties of Crawford, Richland, Ashland, Wayne, Marion, Morrow, Knox, Holmes, Delaware, Franklin, and Fairfield.   
  The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Pennsylvania State Department of Banking as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation. The financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries are not necessarily indicative of future performance. CNB Securities Corporation is incorporated in Delaware and currently maintains
investments in debt and equity securities. CNB Insurance Agency, incorporated in Pennsylvania, provides for the sale of nonproprietary annuities and other insurance products. Holiday Financial Services Corporation ( Holiday ), incorporated
in Pennsylvania, offers small balance unsecured loans and secured loans, primarily collateralized by automobiles and equipment, to borrowers with higher risk characteristics.      When we use the terms  we ,  us  and  our , we mean CNB Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries. Management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
with the Corporation s consolidated financial statements and related notes.      The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
the Corporation s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in its 2015 Form 10-K, and in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in
Item 1 of this report. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year ending December 31, 2016, or any future period.   
   COMPLETED ACQUISITION / NORTHEAST OHIO MARKET       On July 15, 2016, the Corporation completed its previously announced acquisition of Lake National Bank ( LNB ) of Mentor, Ohio for $22.50 per share in cash, resulting in consideration paid to
LNB shareholders of $24.75 million. Following completion of the merger, the two branches of LNB in Mentor, Ohio are operating as part of the ERIEBANK division of CNB Bank.     In order to facilitate its entry into northeastern Ohio as ERIEBANK, the Corporation had opened a loan production office in Ashtabula, Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2014. Construction of a full-service
branch in Ashtabula began in the third quarter of 2016, with completion anticipated by the end of the first quarter of 2017.       GENERAL
OVERVIEW       Management uses return on average equity, earnings per share, asset quality, and other metrics to measure the performance of the
Corporation. The interest rate environment will continue to play an important role in the future earnings of the Corporation. During the past several years, in order to address the historically low interest rates that are primarily tied to
short-term rates, such as the Prime Rate, the Corporation has taken a variety of measures including instituting rate floors on our commercial lines of credit and home equity lines.      Non-interest costs are expected to increase with the growth of the Corporation; however, management s growth strategies are expected to also result in an increase in earning assets as well as
enhanced non-interest income which is expected to more than offset increases in non-interest expenses in 2016 and beyond. While past results are not an indication of future earnings, management believes the Corporation is well-positioned to sustain
core earnings during 2016.

    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS       Cash and cash equivalents totaled $36.9 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $27.3 million at December 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents fluctuate based on the timing and amount of
liquidity events that occur in the normal course of business.      Management believes the liquidity needs of the Corporation are satisfied by the
current balance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional funding sources, Federal Home Loan Bank financing, and the portions of the securities and loan portfolios that mature within one year. The Corporation expects that
these sources of funds will enable it to meet cash obligations and off-balance sheet commitments as they come due.       SECURITIES
      Securities available for sale and trading securities decreased by $39.2 million or 7.1% since December 31, 2015, and associated cash
proceeds were used primarily to fund loan growth. The footnotes to the consolidated financial statements provide more detail concerning the composition of the Corporation s securities portfolio, the process for evaluating securities for
other-than-temporary impairment, and for valuation of structured pooled trust preferred securities.      The Corporation generally buys into the
market over time and does not attempt to  time  its transactions. In doing this, the highs and lows of the market are averaged into the portfolio and the overall effect of different rate environments is minimized. The Corporation monitors
the earnings performance and the effectiveness of the liquidity of the securities portfolio on a regular basis through meetings of the Asset/Liability Committee of the Corporation s Board of Directors ( ALCO ). The ALCO also reviews
and manages interest rate risk for the Corporation. Through active balance sheet management and analysis of the securities portfolio, a sufficient level of liquidity is maintained to satisfy depositor requirements and various credit needs of our
customers.       LOANS       The
Corporation experienced an increase in loans, net of unearned discount, of $223.1 million, or 14.1%, during the first nine months of 2016. Of the total growth, $122.0 million was acquired from Lake National Bank, and $101.1 million was organic
growth. Lending efforts consist principally of commercial and retail lending, which includes single family residential mortgages and other consumer loans. The Corporation views commercial lending as its competitive advantage and continues to focus
on this area by hiring and retaining experienced loan officers and supporting them with quality credit analysis. The Corporation expects loan demand to be solid and loan balances to grow throughout the remainder of 2016.   
   ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES       The allowance
for loan losses is established by provisions for losses in the loan portfolio as well as overdrafts in deposit accounts. These provisions are charged against current income. Loans and overdrafts deemed not collectible are charged off against the
allowance while any subsequent collections are recorded as recoveries and increase the allowance.

   The table below shows activity within the allowance account for the specified periods (in thousands):
      
    The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to a formal analysis by the Credit Administration and Finance
Departments of the Corporation. As part of the formal analysis, delinquencies and losses are monitored monthly. The loan portfolio is divided into several categories in order to better analyze the entire pool. First is a selection of classified
loans that is given a specific reserve. The remaining loans are pooled, by category, into these segments:       Reviewed

Commercial, industrial, and agricultural          

Commercial mortgages          Homogeneous        

Residential real estate          

Consumer          

Credit cards          

Overdrafts         The reviewed
loan pools are further segregated into four categories: special mention, substandard, doubtful, and pass rated. Historical loss factors are calculated for each pool excluding overdrafts based on the previous eight quarters of experience. The
homogeneous pools are evaluated by analyzing the historical loss factors from the most previous quarter end and the two most recent year ends.   
  The historical loss factors for both the reviewed and homogeneous pools are adjusted based on the following six qualitative factors:   

levels of and trends in delinquencies, non-accrual loans, and classified loans;      

trends in volume and terms of loans;          

effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures;      

experience and ability of management;          

national and local economic trends and conditions; and      

concentrations of credit.      
  The methodology described above was created using the experience of the Corporation s Management team, guidance from the regulatory agencies,
expertise of a third-party loan review provider, and discussions with peers. The resulting factors are applied to the pool balances in order to estimate the probable risk of loss within each pool. Prudent business practices dictate that the level of
the allowance, as well as corresponding charges to the provision for loan losses, should be commensurate with identified areas of risk within the loan portfolio and the attendant risks inherent therein. The quality of the credit risk management
function and the overall administration of this vital segment of the Corporation s assets are critical to the ongoing success of the Corporation.

   The previously mentioned analysis considers numerous historical and other factors to analyze the adequacy of
the allowance and current period charges against the provision for loan losses. Management uses the analysis to compare and plot the actual level of the allowance against the aggregate amount of loans adversely classified in order to compute the
estimated probable losses associated with those loans. Management then determines the current adequacy of the allowance and evaluates trends that may be developing. The volume and composition of the Corporation s loan portfolio continue to
reflect growth in commercial credits including commercial real estate loans.      As mentioned in the Loans section of this analysis, management
considers commercial lending to be a competitive advantage and continues to focus on this area as part of its strategic growth initiatives. However, management recognizes and considers the fact that risk is more pronounced in these types of credits
and is, to a greater degree than with other loans, driven by the economic environment in which the debtor s business operates.      During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of $622 thousand and $2.0 million, as compared to a provision for loan losses of $463 thousand and $1.9 million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Net chargeoffs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $907 thousand and $3.1 million, as compared to $731 thousand and $2.0 million for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase in chargeoffs was primarily attributable to consumer loans held in CNB s consumer discount company, Holiday Financial Services Corporation. Included in the $907 thousand and $3.1 million of net chargeoffs
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $581 thousand and $2.1 million of net chargeoffs related to Holiday Financial Services Corporation. As a result of the purchase accounting requirements associated with a business
combination, the allowance for loan losses previously recorded by Lake National Bank did not carry over to the financial statements of CNB. Instead, CNB recorded a fair value adjustment to the loans acquired from Lake National Bank resulting in a
reduction in the loan balance of $4.1 million, which will be accreted into loan income in proportion to the reduction of the loan principal balances.      There were no new impaired commercial loan relationships that required a significant loss reserve in the first nine months of 2016. In addition, one impaired commercial and industrial loan that had a loss
reserve of $671 thousand at June 30, 2016 was repaid in full in July 2016, resulting in no loss to CNB.      Management believes that the
allowance for loan losses is reasonable and adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in the Corporation s portfolio at September 30, 2016.       FUNDING SOURCES       The Corporation considers deposits, short-term borrowings, and term debt
when evaluating funding sources. Deposits increased $208.7 million from $1.815 billion at December 31, 2015 to $2.024 billion at September 30, 2016. $139.8 million was acquired from Lake National Bank, while $68.9 million was organic
growth. Periodically, the Corporation utilizes term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) and other lenders to meet funding needs. Management plans to maintain access to short-term and long-term borrowings as an available
funding source.      During the second quarter of 2016, the Corporation repaid FHLB long-term borrowings totaling $40.0 million which carried
interest rates ranging from 3.97% to 4.60% and incurred an early repayment penalty of $1.5 million. Resulting interest expense savings for 2016 and 2017 will total $1.9 million.      In September 2016, CNB completed a private placement of $50 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. The notes will mature in October 2026, and will initially
bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears, to, but excluding, October 15, 2021, and thereafter to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier redemption, the interest rate shall reset quarterly to an
interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 455 basis points. These subordinated notes were designed to qualify as Tier 2 capital under the Federal Reserve s capital guidelines and were given an investment
grade rating of BBB- by Kroll Bond Rating Agency. CNB injected the net proceeds from the subordinated notes into its bank subsidiary, CNB Bank, and intends to use the capital for general corporate purposes, including loan growth, additional
liquidity, and working capital. As of September 30, 2016, $35 million of the proceeds from the private placement were held by the Corporation s escrow agent, resulting in an increase in accrued interest receivable and other assets at the end of
the third quarter. These proceeds were remitted to the Corporation on the first business day of October 2016.

    SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY AND CAPITAL RATIOS AND METRICS    
  The Corporation s capital continued to provide a base for profitable growth through September 30, 2016. Total shareholders  equity was
$215.5 million at September 30, 2016 and $201.9 million at December 31, 2015. In the first nine months of 2016, the Corporation earned $15.5 million and declared dividends of $7.2 million, resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 46.2% of
net income.      The Corporation is required to comply with standards of capital adequacy mandated by banking regulators. On January 1, 2015,
rules to implement Basel III capital requirements became effective for community banks.      The rules substantially revised the risk-based
capital requirements in comparison to the previously existing U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduced a new capital measure called  Common Equity Tier 1  ( CET1 ),
(ii) increased the minimum requirements for Tier 1 Capital ratio as well as the minimum levels to be considered well capitalized under prompt corrective action; (iii) and introduced the  capital conservation buffer , designed to
absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer are subject to constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonuses to
executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent
January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).      The Corporation s capital ratios, book value per share and tangible book
value per share as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:       

(1)  
  Tangible common equity, tangible assets and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts. Tangible common equity is
calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and core deposit intangibles from the calculation of shareholders  equity. Tangible assets is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and core deposit intangibles from the calculation of
total assets. Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by the number of shares outstanding. The Corporation believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors that is useful in
understanding its financial condition because they are additional measures used to assess capital adequacy. Because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible common equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to
other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided below (dollars in thousands, except share and per share data).

    LIQUIDITY       Liquidity measures an organization s ability to meet cash obligations as they come due. The consolidated statement of cash flows provides analysis of the Corporation s cash and cash equivalents.
Additionally, management considers that portion of the loan and investment portfolio that matures within one year to be part of the Corporation s liquid assets. The Corporation s liquidity is monitored by both management and the ALCO,
which establishes and monitors ranges of acceptable liquidity. Management believes the Corporation s current liquidity position is acceptable.       OFF BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES       Some financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit
lines, letters of credit and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have
expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such
commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment.      The contractual amount of financial
instruments with off balance sheet risk was as follows at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):       
    Commitments to make loans are generally made for periods of 60 days or less. The fixed rate loan commitments at
September 30, 2016 have interest rates ranging from 1.19% to 18.00% and maturities ranging from 3 months to 20 years. The fixed rate loan commitments at December 31, 2015 have interest rates ranging from 1.19% to 18.00% and maturities
ranging from 3 months to 20 years.      In October 2015, the Corporation entered into a subscription agreement with Oxer BCP Mezzanine Fund, LP
( Oxer ) and committed to invest $5,000 as a limited partner in the fund. Oxer is a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) that is licensed and regulated by the Office of Investment at the Small Business Administration
(SBA). The SBIC license allows SBICs to employ private capital and funds borrowed at a low cost using SBA-guaranteed securities to make investments in qualifying small businesses and similar enterprises as defined by SBA regulations. As of
September 30, 2016, the Corporation has invested $1,338 of its $5,000 commitment.

     R ESULTS   OF  O PERATIONS      
   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015        OVERVIEW OF THE INCOME STATEMENT       The Corporation had net income of $6.4 million in the
third quarter of 2016 and $5.5 million in the third quarter of 2015. The earnings per diluted share were $0.44 in the third quarter of 2016 and $0.38 in the third quarter of 2015. Earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were impacted by merger costs
of $266 thousand. The annualized return on assets and return on equity for the third quarter of 2016 are 1.01% and 11.92% compared to 0.98% and 11.08% for the third quarter of 2015.       INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE       Net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was 3.88%
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 3.75% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net interest income increased by 15.2% from $19.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $21.9 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Corporation s net interest margin has stabilized in 2016 as the Corporation continues to use cash flows from its available-for-sale securities portfolio and core deposit growth,
supplemented by short-term borrowings as needed, to fund loan growth.       PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES    
  The Corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of $622 thousand in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $463 thousand in the third quarter of 2015.
Net chargeoffs in the third quarter of 2016 were $907 thousand, compared to net chargeoffs of $731 thousand in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in chargeoffs was primarily attributable to consumer loans held in CNB s consumer discount
company, Holiday Financial Services Corporation.      Management believes the provision for loan losses was appropriate and the allowance for loan
losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in our portfolio as of September 30, 2016.       NON-INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSES
      Non-interest income was $4.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $4.0 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2015.      Total non-interest expenses were $17.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$15.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015.      Salaries and benefits expenses increased $934 thousand, or 12.3%, during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had 471 full-time equivalent staff, compared to 430 full-time equivalent staff as of
September 30, 2015. The staff added during this period included both customer-facing personnel such as business development and wealth management officers, as well as support department personnel. In addition, CNB retained 20 employees in
connection with the acquisition of Lake National Bank.      Visa check card expenses of $587 thousand and $579 thousand during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, were reclassified as a reduction of other non-interest income to non-interest expense.       INCOME TAX EXPENSE       Income tax expense was $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2016 and
$2.0 million in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in effective tax rates of 26.1% and 27.0% for the periods, respectively. The effective rates for the periods differed from the federal statutory rate of 35.0% principally as a result of tax exempt
income from securities and loans as well as earnings from bank owned life insurance.

    Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
   OVERVIEW OF THE INCOME STATEMENT       The
Corporation had net income of $15.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $16.7 for the same period of 2015. The earnings per diluted share were $1.07 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1.16 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. Earnings in 2016 were impacted by a prepayment penalty on the early payoff of long-term borrowings of $1.5 million, core processing conversion costs of $1.6 million, merger costs of $481 thousand, and
realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities of $1.0 million. The annualized return on assets and return on equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are 0.87% and 9.78% compared to 1.00% and 11.34%, respectively for
the same period of 2015.       INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE       Net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was 3.76% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 3.74% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net interest income
increased by 8.1% from $55.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $60.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Corporation s net interest margin has stabilized in 2016 as the Corporation continues
to use cash flows from its available-for-sale securities portfolio and core deposit growth, supplemented by short-term borrowings as needed, to fund loan growth.       PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES       The Corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.0
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.9 million in the nine months ending September 30, 2015. Net chargeoffs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $3.1 million, compared to net chargeoffs of
$2.0 million in the same period of 2015. The increase in chargeoffs was primarily attributable to consumer loans held in CNB s consumer discount company, Holiday Financial Services Corporation. Resulting increases in the provision for loan
losses in the consumer lending portfolio were offset by a decrease in the general loan loss reserves required in 2016 due to lower historical loss rates in the commercial   industrial, commercial real estate, and residential real estate
portfolio segments.      Management believes the provision for loan losses was appropriate and the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb
probable incurred losses in our portfolio as of September, 2016.       NON-INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSES    
  Non-interest income was $13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $12.4 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. In 2016, the Corporation realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities in the amount of $1.0 million, including $922 thousand on the sale of two structured pooled trust preferred securities that had no carrying
value due to other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded in previous periods. Net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2015 were $564 thousand.      Total non-interest expenses were $50.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $43.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Throughout 2015 and the
first nine months of 2016, CNB made numerous infrastructure, personnel, and other investments to facilitate its continued growth. In order to better serve our customers and to achieve operational efficiencies, CNB completed a core processing system
upgrade in May 2016. Included in non-interest expenses in 2016 were merger related expenses of $481 thousand, costs associated with our core processing system upgrade of $1.6 million, and a prepayment penalty associated with the early payoff of
long-term borrowings of $1.5 million. The borrowings totaled $40 million and carried interest rates ranging from 3.97% to 4.60%, and the resulting interest expense savings for 2016 and 2017 will total $1.9 million.   
  Salaries and benefits expenses increased $2.2 million, or 10.1%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had 471 full-time equivalent staff, compared to 430 full-time equivalent staff as of September 30, 2015. The staff added during this period included both customer-facing
personnel such as business development and wealth management officers, as well as support department personnel. In addition, CNB retained 20 employees in connection with the acquisition of Lake National Bank.

   Visa check card expenses of $1.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015, were reclassified as a reduction of other non-interest income to non-interest expense.       INCOME TAX EXPENSE
      Income tax expense was $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $6.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, resulting in effective tax rates of 24.9% and 27.1% for the periods, respectively. The effective rates for the periods differed from the federal statutory rate of 35.0% principally as a result of tax exempt income from
securities and loans, earnings from bank owned life insurance, and nondeductible merger costs.       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
      The Corporation s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the financial
services industry. Accounting and reporting practices for the allowance for loan losses and fair value of securities are deemed critical since they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. In addition, the fair
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations, including the associated goodwill that was recorded, required the use of material estimates. Application of assumptions different than those used by
management could result in material changes in the Corporation s financial position or results of operations. Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 2 (Business Combination), Note 4 (Securities), and Note 5 (Loans) of the
Corporation s 2015 Form 10-K, provide detail with regard to the Corporation s accounting for the allowance for loan losses, the fair value of securities, business combinations and loans. There have been no significant changes in the
application of accounting policies since December 31, 2015.         I TEM  3
       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       As a financial institution, the Corporation s primary source of market risk is interest rate risk, which is the exposure to fluctuations in the Corporation s future earnings resulting from
changes in interest rates. This exposure is correlated to the repricing characteristics of the Corporation s portfolio of assets and liabilities. Each asset or liability reprices either at maturity or during the life of the instrument.
     The principal purpose of asset/liability management is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of
interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements. Net interest income is enhanced by increasing the net interest margin and by the growth in earning assets. As a result, the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to
maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at an acceptable level.      The
Corporation uses an asset-liability management model to measure the effect of interest rate changes on its net interest income. The Corporation s management also reviews asset-liability maturity gap and repricing analyses regularly. The
Corporation does not always attempt to achieve a precise match between interest sensitive assets and liabilities because it believes that an actively managed amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate in the management of the
Corporation s profitability.      Asset-liability modeling techniques and simulation involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot
be measured with precision. Key assumptions in these analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, prepayments on amortizing assets, non-maturing deposit sensitivity, and loan and deposit pricing. These
assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a
relative gauge of the Corporation s interest rate risk position over time.

   Management reviews interest rate risk on a quarterly basis and reports to the ALCO. This review includes
earnings shock scenarios whereby interest rates are immediately increased and decreased by 100, 300, and 400 basis points. These scenarios, detailed in the table below, indicate that there would not be a significant variance in net interest income
over a one-year period due to interest rate changes; however, actual results could vary significantly. Based on the most recent data available as of June 30, 2016, all interest rate risk levels according to the model were within the tolerance
limits of ALCO approved policy of +/- 25%. In addition, the table does not take into consideration changes that management would make to realign its assets and liabilities in the event of an unexpected change in the interest rate environment. Due to
the historically low interest rate environment, the -300 and -400 scenarios have been excluded from the table.

   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       As of the end
of the period covered by this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) ( Exchange Act ). Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer have concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. There were no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.
