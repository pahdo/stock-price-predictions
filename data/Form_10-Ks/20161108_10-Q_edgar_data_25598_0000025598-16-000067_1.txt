SPRINGLEAF FINANCE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
  September 30, 2016 

1  .    Business and Basis of Presentation       
    
  Springleaf Finance Corporation ( SFC  or, collectively with its subsidiaries, whether directly or indirectly owned,  Springleaf,  the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Springleaf Finance, Inc. ( SFI ). SFI is a wholly owned subsidiary of OneMain Holdings, Inc. ( OMH ). 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , Springleaf Financial Holdings, LLC (the  Initial Stockholder ) owned approximately   58%   of OMH s common stock. The Initial Stockholder is owned primarily by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC ( Fortress ). 
    
  SFC is a financial services holding company with subsidiaries engaged in the consumer finance and insurance businesses. 
    
  BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  We prepared our condensed consolidated financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). These statements are unaudited. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from our audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The statements include the accounts of SFC, its subsidiaries (all of which are wholly owned, except for certain subsidiaries associated with a joint venture in which we owned a   47%   equity interest prior to March 31, 2016), and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) in which we hold a controlling financial interest and for which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary as of the financial statement date. 
    
  We eliminated all material intercompany accounts and transactions. We made judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. In management s opinion, the condensed consolidated financial statements include the normal, recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of results. Ultimate results could differ from our estimates. We evaluated the effects of and the need to disclose events that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date. To conform to the 2016 presentation, we have reclassified certain items in prior periods, including certain items in prior periods of our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K ). We follow the same significant accounting policies for our interim reporting, except for the change in accounting policy discussed below. As a result of the change in accounting policy, we have revised certain sections in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect the retrospective application of this change in accounting policy, and such revised disclosures are included in exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on August 29, 2016 (the  retrospective Form 8-K ). Therefore, the condensed consolidated financial statements in this report should also be read in conjunction with the retrospective Form 8-K. 
    
  CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY 
    
  Effective April 1, 2016, we changed our accounting policy for the derecognition of loans within a purchased credit impaired pool. Historically, we removed loans from a purchased credit impaired pool upon charge-off of the loan, based on the Company s charge-off accounting policy at their allocated carrying value. Under our new accounting policy, loans will be removed from a purchased credit impaired pool when the loan is written-off, at which time further collections efforts would not be pursued, or sold or repaid. While both methods are acceptable under GAAP, we believe the new method for derecognition of purchased credit impaired loans is preferable as it enhances consistency with our industry peers. As of January 1, 2015, the cumulative effect of applying the change in accounting policy increased shareholder s equity by   $37 million  . 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the effect of this change in accounting policy was as follows: 

decreased income before provision for income taxes by   $56 million  ; 
                
    decreased net income by   $34 million  ; and 
                
    decreased net income attributable to SFC by   $37 million  . 
       
  The effect of the change in accounting policy on the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was less than   $1 million  . 
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

Our policy for derecognition of purchased credit impaired loans following the change described above is presented below: 
    
  Purchased Credit Impaired Finance Receivables 
    
  As part of each of our acquisitions, we identify a population of finance receivables for which it is determined that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. The population of accounts identified generally consists of those finance receivables that are (i)   60   days or more past due at acquisition, (ii) which had been classified as troubled debt restructured ( TDR ) finance receivables as of the acquisition date, (iii) may have been previously modified, or (iv) had other indications of credit deterioration as of the acquisition date. 
    
  We accrete the excess of the cash flows expected to be collected on the purchased credit impaired finance receivables over the discounted cash flows (the  accretable yield ) into interest income at a level rate of return over the expected lives of the underlying pools of the purchased credit impaired finance receivables. The underlying pools are based on finance receivables with common risk characteristics. We have established policies and procedures to update on a quarterly basis the amount of cash flows we expect to collect, which incorporates assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of then current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected finance receivable cash flows result in the recognition of impairment, which is recognized through the provision for finance receivable losses. Probable significant increases in expected cash flows to be collected would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for finance receivable losses; any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as adjustments to the respective pool s yield. 
    
  Our purchased credit impaired finance receivables remain in our purchased credit impaired pools until liquidation or write-off. We do not reclassify modified purchased credit impaired finance receivables as TDR finance receivables. 
    
  We have additionally established policies and procedures related to maintaining the integrity of these pools. A finance receivable will not be removed from a pool unless we sell, foreclose, or otherwise receive assets in satisfaction of a particular finance receivable or a finance receivable is written-off. If a finance receivable is renewed and additional funds are lent and terms are adjusted to current market conditions, we consider this a new finance receivable and the previous finance receivable is removed from the pool. If the facts and circumstances indicate that a finance receivable should be removed from a pool, that finance receivable will be removed at its allocated carrying amount, and such removal will not affect the yield used to recognize accretable yield of the pool. 
    
  We have retrospectively applied this change in accounting policy. The effect of this change in accounting policy on the amounts previously reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are included in the following tables.

We have also adjusted the applicable prior period amounts in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I, Item 2 herein to reflect the impact of this change in accounting policy.

  OMH S ACQUISITION OF ONEMAIN FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, LLC 
    
  On November 15, 2015, OMH, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Independence Holdings, LLC ( Independence ), completed its acquisition of OneMain Financial Holdings, LLC ( OMFH ) from CitiFinancial Credit Company ( Citigroup ) for approximately   $4.5 billion   in cash (the  OneMain Acquisition ). As a result of the OneMain Acquisition, OMFH became a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of OMH. OMFH is not a subsidiary of SFC and SFC is not a subsidiary of OMFH. 
    
  In connection with the closing of the OneMain Acquisition, on November 13, 2015, OMH and certain subsidiaries of SFC entered into an Asset Preservation Stipulation and Order and agreed to a Proposed Final Judgment (collectively, the  Settlement Agreement ) with the U.S. Department of Justice (the  DOJ ), as well as the state attorneys general for Colorado, Idaho, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia. The Settlement Agreement resolved the inquiries of the DOJ and such attorneys general with respect to the OneMain Acquisition and allowed OMH to proceed with the closing. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, OMH agreed to divest   127   branches of SFC subsidiaries across   11   states as a condition for approval of the OneMain Acquisition. The Settlement Agreement required certain of OMH s subsidiaries (the  Branch Sellers ) to operate these   127   branches as an ongoing, economically viable and competitive business until sold to the divestiture purchaser. The court overseeing the settlement appointed a third-party monitor to oversee management of the divestiture branches and ensure the Company s compliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. 
    
  SPRINGCASTLE INTERESTS SALE 
    
  On March 31, 2016, SFI, SpringCastle Holdings, LLC ( SpringCastle Holdings ) and Springleaf Acquisition Corporation ( Springleaf Acquisition  and, together with SpringCastle Holdings, the  SpringCastle Sellers ), wholly owned subsidiaries of OMH, entered into a purchase agreement with certain subsidiaries of New Residential Investment Corp. ( NRZ  and such subsidiaries, the  NRZ Buyers ) and BTO Willow Holdings II, L.P. and Blackstone Family Tactical Opportunities Investment Partnership NQ ESC L.P. (collectively, the  Blackstone Buyers  and together with the NRZ Buyers, the  SpringCastle Buyers ). Pursuant to the purchase agreement, on March 31, 2016, SpringCastle Holdings sold its   47%   limited liability company interest in each of SpringCastle America, LLC, SpringCastle Credit, LLC and SpringCastle Finance, LLC, and Springleaf Acquisition sold its   47%   limited liability company interest in SpringCastle Acquisition LLC, to the SpringCastle Buyers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $112 million   (the  SpringCastle Interests Sale ). SpringCastle America, LLC, SpringCastle Credit, LLC, SpringCastle Finance, LLC and SpringCastle Acquisition LLC are collectively referred to herein as the  SpringCastle Joint Venture.  
    
  The SpringCastle Joint Venture primarily holds subordinate ownership interests in a securitized loan portfolio (the  SpringCastle Portfolio ), which consists of unsecured loans and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages and includes both closed-end accounts and open-end lines of credit. These loans are in a liquidating status and vary in form and substance from the Company s originated loans. At December 31, 2015, the SpringCastle Portfolio included over   232,000   of acquired loans, representing   $1.7 billion   in net finance receivables. 
    
  In connection with the SpringCastle Interests Sale, the SpringCastle Buyers paid   $101 million   of the aggregate purchase price to the SpringCastle Sellers on March 31, 2016, with the remaining   $11 million   paid into an escrow account on July 29, 2016. Such escrowed funds are expected to be held in escrow for a period of up to   five years   following March 31, 2016, and, subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and assuming certain portfolio performance requirements are satisfied, paid to the SpringCastle Sellers at the end of such   five  -year period. In connection with the SpringCastle Interests Sale, we recorded a net gain in other revenues at the time of sale of $  167 million  . 
    
  As a result of this sale, SpringCastle Acquisition and SpringCastle Holdings no longer hold any ownership interests of the SpringCastle Joint Venture. However, unless SFI is terminated, SFI will remain as servicer of the SpringCastle Portfolio under the servicing agreement for the SpringCastle Funding Trust. In addition, we deconsolidated the underlying loans of the SpringCastle Portfolio and previously issued securitized interests, which were reported in long-term debt, as we no longer were considered the primary beneficiary. 
    
  Prior to the SpringCastle Interests Sale, affiliates of the NRZ Buyers owned a   30%   limited liability company interest in the SpringCastle Joint Venture, and affiliates of the Blackstone Buyers owned a   23%   limited liability company interest in the SpringCastle Joint Venture (together, the  Other Members ). The Other Members are parties to the purchase agreement for purposes of certain limited indemnification obligations and post-closing expense reimbursement obligations of the SpringCastle Joint Venture to the SpringCastle Sellers.

The NRZ Buyers are subsidiaries of NRZ, which is externally managed by an affiliate of Fortress. The Initial Stockholder, which owned approximately   58%   of OMH s common stock as of March 31, 2016, the date of sale, was owned primarily by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress. Mr. Edens, Chairman of the Board of Directors of OMH, also serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors of NRZ. Mr. Edens is also a principal of Fortress and serves as Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Fortress. Mr. Jacobs, a member of the Board of Directors of OMH, also serves as a member of NRZ s Board of Directors and Fortress  Board of Directors. 
    
  The purchase agreement included customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities. We did not record a sales recourse obligation related to the SpringCastle Interests Sale. 
    
  SFC S OFFERING OF 8.25% SENIOR NOTES 
    
  On April 11, 2016, SFC issued   $1.0 billion   aggregate principal amount of   8.25%   Senior Notes due 2020 (the  8.25% SFC Notes ) under an Indenture dated as of December 3, 2014 (the  Base Indenture ), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 3, 2014 (the  First Supplemental Indenture ) and a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 11, 2016 (the  Second Supplemental Indenture  and, collectively with the Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture, the  Indenture ), pursuant to which OMH provided a guarantee of the notes on an unsecured basis. 
    
  SFC used a portion of the proceeds from the offering to repurchase approximately   $600 million   aggregate principal amount of its existing senior notes that mature in 2017, at a premium to principal amount from certain beneficial owners, and certain of those beneficial owners purchased new SFC senior notes in the offering. SFC intends to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include further debt repurchases and repayments. 
    
  The notes are SFC s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all of SFC s other existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The notes are effectively subordinated to all of SFC s secured obligations to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations and structurally subordinated to any existing and future obligations of SFC s subsidiaries with respect to claims against the assets of such subsidiaries. 
    
  The notes may be redeemed at any time and from time to time, at the option of SFC, in whole or in part at a  make-whole  redemption price specified in the Indenture. The notes will not have the benefit of any sinking fund. 
    
  The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, (i) limit SFC s ability to create liens on assets and (ii) restrict SFC s ability to consolidate, merge or sell its assets. The Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them were to occur, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the notes to become, or to be declared, due and payable. 
    
  LENDMARK SALE 
    
  On November 12, 2015, OMH and the Branch Sellers entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Lendmark Financial Services, LLC ( Lendmark ) to sell   127   Springleaf branches and, subject to certain exclusions, the associated personal loans issued to customers of such branches, fixed non-information technology assets and certain other tangible personal property located in such branches to Lendmark (the  Lendmark Sale ) for a purchase price equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate unpaid balance as of closing of the purchased loans multiplied by   103%  , plus (ii) for each interest-bearing purchased loan, an amount equal to all unpaid interest that had accrued on the unpaid balance at the applicable note rate from the most recent interest payment date through the closing, plus (iii) the sum of all prepaid charges and fees and security deposits of the Branch Sellers to the extent arising under the purchased contracts as reflected on the books and records of the Branch Sellers as of closing, subject to certain limitations if the purchase price would exceed   $695 million   and Lendmark would be unable to obtain financing on certain specified terms. In anticipation of the sale of these branches, we transferred   $608 million   of personal loans from held for investment to held for sale on September 30, 2015. 
    
  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we were required to dispose of the branches to be sold in connection with the Lendmark Sale within   120 days   following November 13, 2015, subject to such extensions as the DOJ may approve. As we did not believe we would be able to consummate the Lendmark Sale prior to April 1, 2016, we requested   two   extensions of the closing deadline set forth in the Settlement Agreement. The DOJ granted our requests through May 13, 2016. 
    
  On May 2, 2016, we completed the Lendmark Sale for an aggregate cash purchase price of   $624 million  . Such sale was effective as of April 30, 2016, and included the sale to Lendmark of personal loans with an unpaid principal balance ( UPB ) as of March 31, 2016 of   $600 million  . OMH has entered into a transition services agreement with Lendmark dated as of May 2, 2016 (the  Transition Services Agreement ), and OMH s and our activities will remain subject to the oversight of the Monitoring Trustee appointed by the court pursuant to the Settlement Agreement until the expiration of the Transition Services

Agreement. The Transition Services Agreement is currently scheduled to expire on or before February 2, 2017, subject to an additional   three  -month extension with the permission of the DOJ. Although we and OMH continue to take such steps as we believe are necessary to comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, no assurance can be given that we will not incur fines or penalties associated with OMH s or our activities pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement or OMH s or our efforts to comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. 
    
  On May 2, 2016, SFC used a portion of the proceeds from the Lendmark Sale to repay, in full, its revolving demand note with OMFH, which totaled $  376 million   (including interest payable of $  6 million  ). 
    
  REAL ESTATE LOAN SALE 
    
  On August 3, 2016, SFC and certain of its subsidiaries sold a portfolio of second lien mortgage loans for aggregate cash proceeds of   $246 million   (the  August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale ). In connection with this sale, we recorded a net loss in other revenues at the time of sale of   $4 million  . Unless we are terminated or we resign as servicer, we will continue to service the loans included in this sale pursuant to a servicing agreement. The purchase and sale agreement and the servicing agreement include customary representations and warranties and indemnification provisions. 

3  .    Recent Accounting Pronouncements       
    
  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS RECENTLY ADOPTED 
    
  Consolidation 
    
  In February of 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,   Consolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which amends the current consolidation guidance and ends the deferral granted to reporting entities with variable interests in investment companies from applying certain prior amendments to the VIE guidance. This ASU is applicable to entities across all industries, particularly those that use limited partnerships as well as entities in any industry that outsource decision making or have historically applied related party tiebreakers in their consolidation analysis and disclosures. The standard became effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We have adopted this ASU and concluded that it does not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Technical Corrections and Improvements 
    
  In June of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-10,   Technical Corrections and Improvements  , to correct differences between original guidance and the Accounting Standards Codification, clarify the guidance, correct references and make minor improvements affecting a variety of topics. The amendments to this transition guidance became effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We have adopted this ASU and concluded that it does not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Debt Instruments 
    
  In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06,   Contingent Puts and Call Options in Debt Instruments  , which clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt host. The ASU requires assessing the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. The amendment of this ASU becomes effective on a modified retrospective basis for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. We have early adopted this ASU and concluded that it does not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Stock Compensation 
    
  In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU were adopted as follows: 

We adopted the amendment requiring recognition of tax benefits related to exercised or vested awards through the income statement rather than additional paid-in capital on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2016. Further, as of January 1, 2016, there was no impact to additional paid-in capital as a result of our adoption of this ASU under the modified retrospective method. 
     
   14 

     Table of Contents  

We did not adopt the amendment allowing for the use of the actual number of shares vested each period, rather than estimating the number of awards that are expected to vest. We continue to use an estimate as it relates to the number of awards that are expected to vest. 

We adopted the amendment for the threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates, under the modified retrospective basis as of January 1, 2016. This amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

We adopted the amendment requiring the classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes to be presented in the financing activities instead of the operating activities, under the retrospective method as of January 1, 2014. This amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

We adopted the amendment requiring the classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows to be presented in the operating activities instead of the financing activities, under the prospective method as of September 30, 2016. This amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
       
  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO BE ADOPTED 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  In May of 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which provides a consistent revenue accounting model across industries. In August of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date  , to defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year, which would result in the ASU becoming effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Principal versus Agent Considerations,   which clarifies the implementation of the guidance on principal versus agent considerations from ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of the guidance in ASU 2014-09, but rather clarifies the distinction between principal versus agent considerations when implementing ASU 2014-09. In April of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , to clarify the implementation guidance of ASU 2014-09 relating to performance obligations and licensing. In May of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,   to clarify guidance in ASU 2014-09 related to assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts/contract modifications. We are evaluating whether the adoption of these accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Short-Duration Insurance Contracts Disclosures 
    
  In May of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09,   Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts  , to address enhanced disclosure requirements for insurers relating to short-duration insurance contract claims and unpaid claims liability rollforward for long and short-duration contracts. The disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an insurance entity s initial claim estimates and subsequent adjustments to those estimates, the methodologies and judgments used to estimate claims, and the timing, frequency, and severity of claims. The amendments in this ASU become effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Financial Instruments 
    
  In January of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments. The update requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. This ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and assumptions to estimate fair value for financial instruments, requires the use of the exit price for disclosure purposes, requires the change in liability due to a change in credit risk to be presented in other comprehensive income, requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of asset (securities and loans), and clarifies the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities. The amendments in this ASU become effective prospectively for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. We are evaluating whether the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

     Table of Contents  

Leases 
    
  In February of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . The ASU will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on leases with terms greater than 12 months and to disclose information related to the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases, including various qualitative and quantitative requirements. The amendments in this ASU become effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are evaluating whether the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Investments 
    
  In March of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  , which eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The ASU requires that an entity that has available-for-sale securities recognize, through earnings, the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendment in this ASU becomes effective prospectively for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. We are evaluating whether the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging 
    
  In May of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)  , to rescind certain SEC guidance in Topic 605 and Topic 815 as ASU 2014-09 becomes effective. Our adoption of ASU 2014-09 will bring us into alignment with this ASU. We are evaluating whether the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Allowance for Finance Receivables Losses 
    
  In June of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The ASU significantly changes the way that entities will be required to measure credit losses. The new standard requires that the estimated credit loss be based upon an  expected credit loss  approach rather than the  incurred loss  approach currently required. The new approach will require entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of collectability. It is anticipated that the expected credit loss model will require earlier recognition of credit losses than the incurred loss approach. 
    
  The ASU requires that credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination that are measured at amortized cost basis be     determined in a similar manner to other financial assets measured at amortized cost basis; however, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price of the financial asset rather than being reported as a credit loss expense. Subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded in earnings. Interest income should be recognized based on the effective rate, excluding the discount embedded in the purchase price attributable to expected credit losses at acquisition. 
    
  The ASU also requires companies to record allowances for held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities rather than write-downs of such assets. 
    
  In addition, the ASU requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures that provide information about the allowance and the significant factors that influenced management s estimate of the allowance. 
    
  The ASU will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2019. We believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and we are in the process of evaluating the expected impacts. 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows 
    
  In August of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows  , which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating whether the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

We do not believe that any other accounting pronouncements issued during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , but not yet effective, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures, if adopted. 

4  .    Finance Receivables       
    
  Our finance receivable types include personal loans, real estate loans, and retail sales finance as defined below: 

Personal loans     are secured by consumer goods, automobiles, or other personal property or are unsecured, typically non-revolving with a fixed-rate and a fixed, original term of   two   to   five years  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had over   941,000   personal loans representing   $4.8 billion   of net finance receivables, compared to   890,000   personal loans totaling   $4.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . 

Real estate loans     are secured by first or second mortgages on residential real estate, generally have maximum original terms of   360 months  , and are considered non-conforming. Real estate loans may be closed-end accounts or open-end home equity lines of credit and are primarily fixed-rate products. Since we ceased real estate lending in January of 2012, our real estate loans are in a liquidating status. 

Retail sales finance     include retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts. Retail sales contracts are closed-end accounts that represent a single purchase transaction. Revolving retail accounts are open-end accounts that can be used for financing repeated purchases from the same merchant. Retail sales contracts are secured by the personal property designated in the contract and generally have maximum original terms of   60 months  . Revolving retail accounts are secured by the goods purchased and generally require minimum monthly payments based on the amount financed calculated after the most recent purchase or outstanding balances. Our retail sales finance portfolio is in a liquidating status. 
       
  Our finance receivable types also included the SpringCastle Portfolio at   December 31, 2015  , as defined below: 

SpringCastle Portfolio     included unsecured loans and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages that were sold on March 31, 2016, in connection with the SpringCastle Interests Sale. The SpringCastle Portfolio included both closed-end accounts and open-end lines of credit. These loans were in a liquidating status and varied in substance and form from our originated loans. Unless SFI is terminated, SFI will continue to provide the servicing for these loans pursuant to a servicing agreement, which SFI services as unsecured loans because the liens are subordinated to superior ranking security interests. 
       
  Components of net finance receivables held for investment by type were as follows: 

17 

     Table of Contents  

* 
    Gross receivables are defined as follows: 

Finance receivables purchased as a performing receivable     gross finance receivables equal the UPB for interest bearing accounts and the gross remaining contractual payments for precompute accounts; additionally, the remaining unearned discount, net of premium established at the time of purchase, is included in both interest bearing and precompute accounts to reflect the finance receivable balance at its initial fair value; 

Finance receivables originated subsequent to the Fortress Acquisition     gross finance receivables equal the UPB for interest bearing accounts and the gross remaining contractual payments for precompute accounts; 

Purchased credit impaired finance receivables     gross finance receivables equal the remaining estimated cash flows less the current balance of accretable yield on the purchased credit impaired accounts; and 

TDR finance receivables     gross finance receivables equal the UPB for interest bearing accounts and the gross remaining contractual payments for precompute accounts; additionally, the remaining unearned discount, net of premium established at the time of purchase, is included in both interest bearing and precompute accounts previously purchased as a performing receivable. 
       
  Unused lines of credit extended to customers by the Company were as follows: 

Unused lines of credit on our personal loans can be suspended if any of the following occurs: (i) the value of the collateral declines significantly; (ii) we believe the borrower will be unable to fulfill the repayment obligations; or (iii) any other default by the borrower of any material obligation under the agreement occurs. Unused lines of credit on our real estate loans can be suspended if any of the following occurs: (i) the value of the real estate declines significantly below the property s initial appraised value; (ii) we believe the borrower will be unable to fulfill the repayment obligations because of a material change in the borrower s financial circumstances; or (iii) any other default by the borrower of any material obligation under the agreement occurs. Unused lines of credit on home equity lines of credit can be terminated for delinquency. Accordingly, no reserve has been recorded for the unused lines of credit. 
    
  CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS 
    
  We consider the delinquency status and nonperforming status of the finance receivable as our primary credit quality indicators. 
    
  We accrue finance charges on revolving retail finance receivables up to the date of charge-off at   180 days   past due. Our revolving retail finance receivables that were more than   90 days   past due and still accruing finance charges at   September 30, 2016   and at   December 31, 2015   were   immaterial  . Our personal loans and real estate loans do not have finance receivables that were more than   90 days   past due and still accruing finance charges. 
    
  Delinquent and Nonperforming Finance Receivables 
    
  We consider the delinquency status of the finance receivable as our primary credit quality indicator. We monitor delinquency trends to manage our exposure to credit risk. We consider finance receivables   60 days   or more past due as delinquent and consider the likelihood of collection to decrease at such time. 
    
  We also monitor finance receivable performance trends to evaluate the potential risk of future credit losses. At   90 days   or more past due, we consider our finance receivables to be nonperforming. Once the finance receivables are considered as nonperforming, we consider them to be at increased risk for credit loss.

The following is a summary of net finance receivables held for investment by type and by number of days delinquent: 

PURCHASED CREDIT IMPAIRED FINANCE RECEIVABLES 
    
  Our purchased credit impaired finance receivables consist of receivables purchased as part of the following transaction: 

Ownership interest acquired by FCFI Acquisition LLC, an affiliate of Fortress (the  Fortress Acquisition )   - we revalued our assets and liabilities based on their fair value at the date of the Fortress Acquisition, November 30, 2010, in accordance with purchase accounting and adjusted the carrying value of our finance receivables (the  FA Loans ) to their fair value. 
       
  At December 31, 2015, our purchased credit impaired finance receivables also included the SpringCastle Portfolio, which was purchased as part of the following transaction: 

SFI s capital contribution of its wholly owned subsidiary, Springleaf Acquisition Corporation ( SAC ), to SFC   - on July 31, 2014 (the  SAC Capital Contribution ), SFC acquired a   47%   equity interest in the SpringCastle Portfolio (the

     Table of Contents  

SCP Loans ), some of which were determined to be credit impaired when SAC acquired the SCP Loans on April 1, 2013. On March 31, 2016, we sold the SpringCastle Portfolio in connection with the SpringCastle Interests Sale described in Note   2  . 
    
  We report the carrying amount (which initially was the fair value) of our purchased credit impaired finance receivables in net finance receivables, less allowance for finance receivable losses or in finance receivables held for sale as discussed below.

  We report finance receivables held for sale of   $166 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $793 million   at   December 31, 2015  , which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. At   September 30, 2016  , finance receivables held for sale consisted entirely of real estate loans, compared to $  617 million   of personal loans and $  176 million   of real estate loans at   December 31, 2015  . At September 30, 2016 and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of our finance receivables held for sale exceeded the cost. We used the aggregate basis to determine the lower of cost or fair value of finance receivables held for sale. 
    
  On June 30, 2016, we transferred   $257 million   of real estate loans (after deducting allowance for finance receivable losses) from held for investment to held for sale due to management s intent to no longer hold these finance receivables for the foreseeable future. In connection with the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale, we sold a portfolio of second lien mortgage loans with a carrying value of   $250 million   and recorded a net loss in other revenues of   $4 million  . 
    
  On May 2, 2016, we sold personal loans held for sale with a carrying value of   $602 million   and recorded a net gain in other revenues at the time of sale of   $22 million  .

    Unrealized losses on certain available-for-sale securities were less than   $1 million   and, therefore, are not quantified in the table above. 
       
  On a lot basis, we had   90   and   198   investment securities in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. We do not consider the unrealized losses to be credit-related, as these unrealized losses primarily relate to changes in interest rates and market spreads subsequent to purchase. Additionally, at   September 30, 2016  , we had no plans to sell any investment securities with unrealized losses, and we believe it is more likely than not that we would not be required to sell such investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost. 
    
  We continue to monitor unrealized loss positions for potential impairments. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment credit losses on available-for-sale securities in investment revenues.

11  .    Variable Interest Entities       
    
  As part of our overall funding strategy and as part of our efforts to support our liquidity from sources other than our traditional capital market sources, we have transferred certain finance receivables to VIEs for securitization transactions. Since these transactions involve securitization trusts required to be consolidated, the securitized assets and related liabilities are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements and are accounted for as secured borrowings. 
    
  CONSOLIDATED VIES 
    
  We evaluated the securitization trusts and determined that these entities are VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary, and therefore, we consolidated such entities. We are deemed to be the primary beneficiaries of these VIEs because we have the ability to direct the activities of each VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that are potentially significant to each VIE. Such ability arises from SFC s and its affiliates  contractual right to service the securitized finance receivables. Our retained subordinated note and residual interest trust certificates expose us to potentially significant losses and potentially significant returns. 
    
  The asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts are supported by the expected cash flows from the underlying securitized finance receivables. Cash inflows from these finance receivables are distributed to investors and service providers in accordance with each transaction s contractual priority of payments ( waterfall ) and, as such, most of these inflows must be directed first to service and repay each trust s senior notes or certificates held principally by third-party investors. The holders of the asset-backed securities have no recourse to the Company if the cash flows from the underlying qualified securitized assets are not sufficient to pay all principal and interest on the asset-backed securities. After these senior obligations are extinguished, substantially all cash inflows will be directed to the subordinated notes until fully repaid and, thereafter, to the residual interest that we own in each securitization trust. We retain interests in these securitization transactions, including residual interests in each securitization trust and, in some cases, subordinated securities issued by the VIEs. We retain credit risk in the securitizations through our ownership of the residual interest in each securitization trust, and, in some cases, ownership of the most subordinated class of asset-backed securities, which are the first to absorb credit losses on the securitized assets. We expect that any credit losses in the pools of securitized assets will likely be limited to our subordinated and residual retained interests. We have no obligation to repurchase or replace qualified securitized assets that subsequently become delinquent or are otherwise in default.

We parenthetically disclose on our consolidated balance sheets the VIE s assets that can only be used to settle the VIE s obligations and liabilities if its creditors have no recourse against the primary beneficiary s general credit. The carrying amounts of consolidated VIE assets and liabilities associated with our securitization trusts were as follows: 

SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS 
    
  Auto Loan Securitization 
    
  ODART 2016-1 Securitization.     On July 19, 2016, we completed a private securitization transaction in which OneMain Direct Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1 ( ODART 2016-1 ), a wholly owned special purpose vehicle of SFC, issued   $754 million   principal amount of notes backed by direct auto loans with an aggregate UPB of   $754 million   as of June 30, 2016.   $700 million   principal amount of the notes issued by ODART 2016-1, represented by Classes A, B and C, were sold to unaffiliated parties at a weighted average interest rate of   2.27%  , and   $54 million   principal amount of Class D notes were retained. The maturity dates of the notes occur on January 15, 2021 for the Class A, May 17, 2021 for the Class B, September 15, 2021 for the Class C and February 15, 2023 for the Class D. The first principal and interest payment on the notes was due on August 15, 2016. The indenture governing the ODART 2016-1 notes contains events of default which, if triggered, may result in the acceleration of the obligation to pay principal and interest on the notes. 
    
  Consumer Loan Securitization Transaction 
    
  Call of 2013-B Notes.   On February 16, 2016, Sixteenth Street Funding LLC ( Sixteenth Street ), a wholly owned subsidiary of SFC, exercised its right to redeem the asset backed notes issued by the Springleaf Funding Trust 2013-B on June 19, 2013 (the  2013-B Notes ). To redeem the 2013-B Notes, Sixteenth Street paid a redemption price of $  371 million  , which included   $1 million   of accrued interest and excluded $  30 million   for the Class C and Class D Notes owned by Sixteenth Street on February 16, 2016, the date of the optional redemption. The outstanding principal balance of the 2013-B Notes was $  400 million   on the date of the optional redemption.

Conduit Facilities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our borrowings under conduit facilities consisted of the following: 

(a) 
    First Avenue Funding LLC.   On June 30, 2016, we amended the note purchase agreement with the First Avenue Funding LLC ( First Avenue ) to extend the revolving period ending in March 2018 to June 2018. Following the revolving period, the principal amount of the notes, if any, will be reduced as cash payments are received on the underlying direct auto loans and will be due and payable in full   12   months following the maturity of the last direct auto loan held by First Avenue. 
       
           (b)

(d) 
    Springleaf 2013-VFN1 Trust.   On January 21, 2016, we amended the note purchase agreement with the Springleaf 2013-VFN1 Trust to (i) increase the maximum principal balance from   $350 million   to   $850 million   and (ii) extend the revolving period ending in April 2017 to January 2018, which may be extended to January 2019, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.

           (e) 
    Whitford Brook 2014-VFN1 Trust.   On February 24, 2016, we amended the note purchase agreement with the Whitford Brook Funding Trust 2014-VFN1 (the  Whitford Brook 2014-VFN1 Trust ) to extend the revolving period ending in June 2017 to June 2018. Following the revolving period, the principal amount of the notes, if any, will be reduced as cash payments are received on the underlying personal loans and will be due and payable in the   12   th    month following the end of the revolving period. 
       
  VIE     INTEREST EXPENSE 
    
  Other than our retained subordinate and residual interests in the remaining consolidated securitization trusts, we are under no obligation, either contractually or implicitly, to provide financial support to these entities. Consolidated interest expense related to our VIEs for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $25 million   and   $97 million  , respectively, compared to   $49 million   and   $136 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  DECONSOLIDATED VIES 
    
  As a result of the SpringCastle Interests Sale on March 31, 2016, we deconsolidated the securitization trust holding the underlying loans of the SpringCastle Portfolio and previously issued securitized interests, which were reported in long-term debt. 
    
  As a result of the sales of the mortgage-backed retained certificates during 2014, we (i) deconsolidated the securitization trusts holding the underlying real estate loans and previously issued securitized interests which were reported in long-term debt and (ii) established a reserve for sales recourse obligations of   $6 million   related to these sales. At   September 30, 2016  , this reserve totaled   $6 million  . We had   no   repurchase activity associated with these sales as of   September 30, 2016  . See Note   14   for further information on the total reserve for sales recourse obligations relating to our real estate loan sales, including the sales of the mortgage-backed retained certificates.

13  .    Income Taxes       
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had a net deferred tax liability of   $27 million  , compared to   $113 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease in net deferred tax liability of   $86 million   was primarily due to changes in the fair value of our finance receivables and purchase accounting for debt writedown, partially offset by the impact of the SpringCastle Interests Sale. 
    
  The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   33.6%  , compared to   11.6%   for the same period in   2015  . The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the non-controlling interests in the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the non-controlling interests in the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio. 
    
  We are currently under examination of our U.S. federal tax return for the years 2011 to 2013 by the Internal Revenue Service. Management believes it has adequately provided for taxes for such years. 
    
  The Company s unrecognized tax positions, including interest and penalties, totaled   $10 million   and   $9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, all of which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The amount of any change in the balance of uncertain tax positions over the next   12   months is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. 

14  .    Contingencies       
    
  LEGAL CONTINGENCIES 
    
  In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities. Some of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. While we will continue to evaluate legal actions to determine whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable and is reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from pending, threatened or future litigation, investigations, examinations, or other claims. 
    
  We contest liability and/or the amount of damages, as appropriate, in each pending matter. Where available information indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many actions, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even reasonably possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where loss is reasonably possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss. 
    
  For certain legal actions, we cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for actions that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek substantial or indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the actions in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional loss can be reasonably estimated for any given action. 
    
  For certain other legal actions, we can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued, but do not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses will have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements as a whole. 
    
  SALES RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS 
    
  Real Estate Loan Sales 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our reserve for sales recourse obligations totaled   $14 million  , which primarily related to the real estate loan sales in 2014. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   repurchase activity related to our real estate loan sales in 2014. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we repurchased   13   loans, totaling   $1 million  , associated with the real estate loan sales in 2014. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   material recourse requests with loss exposure that management believed would not be covered by the reserve. However, we will continue to monitor any repurchase activity in the future and will adjust the reserve accordingly. When  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

recourse losses are reasonably possible or exposure to such losses exists in excess of the liability already accrued, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible recourse losses or range of losses. 
    
  The activity in our reserve for sales recourse obligations primarily associated with the real estate loan sales during 2014 was as follows: 

* 
    Reflects the elimination of the reserve associated with other prior sales of finance receivables. 
       
  We did not establish a reserve for sales recourse obligations associated with the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale. 
    
  Lendmark Sale 
    
  We did not establish a reserve for sales recourse obligations associated with the personal loans sold to Lendmark in May of 2016 due to the higher credit quality of the personal loans sold.

16  .    Segment Information       
    
  Our segments coincide with how our businesses are managed. At   September 30, 2016  , our   three   segments included: 

Consumer and Insurance     We originate and service personal loans (secured and unsecured) through   two   business divisions: branch operations and centralized operations. We also offer credit insurance (life insurance, disability insurance, and involuntary unemployment insurance), non-credit insurance, and ancillary products, such as warranty protection. Branch operations primarily conduct business in   28   states. Our centralized operations underwrite and process certain loan applications that we receive from our branch operations or through an internet portal. If the applicant is located near an existing branch ( in footprint ), our centralized operations make the credit decision regarding the application and then request, but do not require, the customer to visit a nearby branch for closing, funding and servicing. If the applicant is not located near a branch ( out of footprint ), our centralized operations originate the loan. 

Acquisitions and Servicing     SFI services the SpringCastle Portfolio that was acquired by an indirect subsidiary of OMH through a joint venture in which SFC previously owned a   47%   equity interest. On March 31, 2016, the SpringCastle Portfolio was sold in connection with the sale of our equity interest in the SpringCastle Joint Venture. These loans consist of unsecured loans and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages and include both closed-end accounts and open-end lines of credit. These loans are in a liquidating status and vary in substance and form from our originated loans. Unless SFI is terminated, SFI will continue to provide the servicing for these loans pursuant to a servicing agreement, which SFI services as unsecured loans because the liens are subordinated to superior ranking security interests. 

Real Estate     We service and hold real estate loans secured by first or second mortgages on residential real estate. Real estate loans previously originated through our branch offices or previously acquired or originated through centralized distribution channels are serviced by: (i) MorEquity and subserviced by Nationstar; (ii) Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.; or (iii) our centralized operations. Investment funds managed by affiliates of Fortress indirectly own a majority interest in Nationstar. Prior to the OneMain Acquisition, this segment also included proceeds from the sale of our real estate loans in 2014. OMH used these proceeds to acquire OneMain. 
       
  The remaining components (which we refer to as  Other ) consist of our other non-originating legacy operations, which are isolated by geographic market and/or distribution channel from our three segments. These operations include: (i) our legacy operations in   14   states where we also ceased branch-based personal lending; (ii) our liquidating retail sales finance portfolio (including retail sales finance accounts from its legacy auto finance operation); (iii) our lending operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; and (iv) the operations of our United Kingdom subsidiary, prior to its liquidation on August 16, 2016. 
    
  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as described below. 
    
  Due to the nature of the Fortress Acquisition, we applied purchase accounting. However, we report the operating results of Consumer and Insurance, Acquisitions and Servicing, Real Estate, and Other using a  Segment Accounting Basis,  which (i) reflects our allocation methodologies for certain costs, primarily interest expense, loan loss reserves and acquisition costs to reflect the manner in which we assess our business results and (ii) excludes the impact of applying purchase accounting (eliminates premiums/discounts on our finance receivables at acquisition, as well as the amortization/accretion in future periods). These allocations and adjustments currently have a material effect on our reported segment basis income as compared to GAAP. We believe a Segment Accounting Basis (a basis other than GAAP) provides investors a consistent basis on which management evaluates segment performance. 

43 

     Table of Contents  

We allocate revenues and expenses (on a Segment Accounting Basis) to each segment using the following methodologies: 
    
                 Interest income 
    Directly correlated with a specific segment. 
      Interest expense 
    Acquisitions and Servicing   - This segment includes interest expense specifically identified to the SpringCastle Portfolio. 
      Consumer and Insurance, Real Estate and Other   - The Company has securitization debt and unsecured debt. The Company first allocates interest expense to its segments based on actual expense for securitizations and secured term debt and using a weighted average for unsecured debt allocated to the segments. Average unsecured debt allocations for the periods presented are as follows: 
      Subsequent to the OneMain Acquisition 
      Total average unsecured debt is allocated as follows: 
      l     Consumer and Insurance   - receives remainder of unallocated average debt; and 
      l     Real Estate and Other   - at 100% of asset base. (Asset base represents the average net finance receivables including finance receivables held for sale.) 
      The net effect of the change in debt allocation and asset base methodologies for the three months ended September 30, 2015, had it been in place as of the beginning of the year, would be an increase in interest expense of $59 million for Consumer and Insurance and a decrease in interest expense of $44 million and $15 million for Real Estate and Other, respectively. 
      The net effect of the change in debt allocation and asset base methodologies for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, had it been in place as of the beginning of the year, would be an increase in interest expense of $179 million for Consumer and Insurance and a decrease in interest expense of $134 million and $45 million for Real Estate and Other, respectively. 
      For the period third quarter 2014 to the OneMain Acquisition 
      Total average unsecured debt was allocated to Consumer and Insurance, Real Estate and Other, such that the total debt allocated across each segment equaled 83%, up to 100% and 100% of each of its respective asset base. Any excess was allocated to Consumer and Insurance. 
      Average unsecured debt was allocated after average securitized debt to achieve the calculated average segment debt. 
      Asset base represented the following: 
      l     Consumer and Insurance   - average net finance receivables, including average net finance receivables held for sale; 
      l     Real Estate   - average net finance receivables, including average net finance receivables held for sale, cash and cash equivalents, investments including proceeds from Real Estate sales; and 
      l       Other   - average net finance receivables other than the periods listed below: 
      l     May 2015 to the OneMain Acquisition   - average net finance receivables and cash and cash equivalents, less proceeds from equity issuance in 2015, operating cash reserve and cash included in other segments. 
      l       February 2015 to April 2015   - average net finance receivables and cash and cash equivalents, less operating cash reserve and cash included in other segments. 
      Provision for finance receivable losses 
    Directly correlated with a specific segment, except for allocations to Other, which are based on the remaining delinquent accounts as a percentage of total delinquent accounts. 
      Other revenues 
    Directly correlated with a specific segment, except for: (i) net gain (loss) on repurchases and repayments of debt, which is allocated to the segments based on the interest expense allocation of debt and (ii) gains and losses on foreign currency exchange, which are allocated to the segments based on the interest expense allocation of debt. 
      Other expenses 
    Salaries and benefits -   Directly correlated with a specific segment. Other salaries and benefits not directly correlated with a specific segment are allocated to each of the segments based on services provided. 
      Other operating expenses   - Directly correlated with a specific segment. Other operating expenses not directly correlated with a specific segment are allocated to each of the segments based on services provided. 
      Insurance policy benefits and claims   - Directly correlated with a specific segment.

Interest income   - reverses the impact of premiums/discounts on non-impaired purchased finance receivables and the interest income recognition under guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 310-20,   Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs  , and reestablishes interest income recognition on a historical cost basis; 

Interest expense   - reverses the impact of premiums/discounts on acquired long-term debt and reestablishes interest expense recognition on a historical cost basis; 

Provision for finance receivable losses   - reverses the impact of providing an allowance for finance receivable losses upon acquisition and reestablishes the allowance on a historical cost basis and reverses the impact of recognition of net charge-offs on purchased credit impaired finance receivables and reestablishes the net charge-offs on a historical cost basis; 

Other revenues   - reestablishes the historical cost basis of mark-to-market adjustments on finance receivables held for sale and on realized gains/losses associated with our investment portfolio; and 

Other expenses   - reestablishes expenses on a historical cost basis by reversing the impact of amortization from acquired intangible assets and including amortization of other historical deferred costs.

    In connection with our policy integration with OneMain, we report unearned insurance premium and claim reserves related to finance receivables (previously reported in insurance claims and policyholder liabilities) as a contra-asset to net finance receivables, which totaled   $240 million   at   September 30, 2015  . 

17  .    Fair Value Measurements       
    
  The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be expected to be received if an asset were to be sold or the amount that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments traded in other-than-active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. An other-than-active market is one in which there are few transactions, the prices are not current, price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or little information is released publicly for the  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

asset or liability being valued. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is listed on an exchange or traded over-the-counter or is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, and general market conditions. 
    
  The following table summarizes the fair values and carrying values of our financial instruments and indicates the fair value hierarchy based on the level of inputs we utilized to determine such fair values:

(a) 
    The detail of purchases and settlements is presented in the table below: 

(b) 
    During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we transferred CMBS securities totaling   $3 million   out of Level 3 primarily related to the greater observability of pricing inputs. 
       
  We used observable and/or unobservable inputs to determine the fair value of positions that we have classified within the Level 3 category. As a result, the unrealized gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the Level 3 tables above may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable (e.g., changes in unobservable long-dated volatilities) inputs. 
    
  The unobservable inputs and quantitative data used in our Level 3 valuations for our investment securities were developed and used in models created by our third-party valuation service providers, which values were used by us for fair value disclosure purposes without adjustment. 
    
  Quantitative information about Level 3 inputs for our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis for which information about the unobservable inputs was reasonably available to us at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows:

    We applied the third-party exception which allows us to omit certain quantitative disclosures about unobservable inputs for other long-term investments. As a result, the weighted average ranges of the inputs for these investment securities are not applicable. 
       
  The fair values of the assets using significant unobservable inputs are sensitive and can be impacted by significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs. Level 3 broker-priced instruments, including RMBS (except for the   one   bond described in note (a) above), CMBS, and CDO/ABS, are excluded from the table above because the unobservable inputs are not reasonably available to us. 
    
  Our RMBS, CMBS, and CDO/ABS securities have unobservable inputs that are reliant on and sensitive to the quality of their underlying collateral. The inputs, although not identical, have similar characteristics and interrelationships. Generally, a change in the assumption used for the probability of default is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment speeds. An improvement in the workout criteria related to the restructured debt and/or debt covenants of the underlying collateral may lead to an improvement in the cash flows and have an inverse impact on other inputs, specifically a reduction in the amount of discount applied for marketability and liquidity, making the structured bonds more attractive to market participants.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   NON-RECURRING BASIS 
    
  We measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. 
    
  Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis on which we recorded impairment charges were as follows: 

* 
    The fair value information presented in the table is as of the date the fair value adjustment was recorded. 
       
  Net impairment charges recorded on assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis were as follows: 

In accordance with the authoritative guidance for the accounting for the impairment of finance receivables held for sale, we wrote down certain finance receivables held for sale reported in our Real Estate segment to their fair value during the second quarter of 2016 and recorded the writedowns in other revenues. 
    
  In accordance with the authoritative guidance for the accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets, we wrote down certain real estate owned reported in our Real Estate segment to their fair value less cost to sell for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and recorded the writedowns in other revenues. The fair values of real estate owned disclosed in the table above are unadjusted for transaction costs, as required by the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. The amounts of real estate owned recorded in other assets are net of transaction costs as required by the authoritative guidance for accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets. 
    
  In accordance with the authoritative guidance for the accounting for the impairment of commercial mortgage loans, we recorded allowance adjustments on certain impaired commercial mortgage loans reported in our Consumer and Insurance segment to record their fair value for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and recorded the net impairments in investment revenues. 
    
  The inputs and quantitative data used in our Level 3 valuations for our real estate owned and commercial mortgage loans are unobservable primarily due to the unique nature of specific real estate assets. Therefore, we used independent third-party providers, familiar with local markets, to determine the values used for fair value disclosures without adjustment.

As a result, the weighted average ranges of the inputs for these assets are not applicable. 
       
  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   VALUATION METHODOLOGIES AND ASSUMPTIONS 
    
  We use the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, including cash and certain cash equivalents, approximates fair value. 
    
  Mutual Funds 
    
  The fair value of mutual funds is based on quoted market prices of the underlying shares held in the mutual funds. 
    
  Investment Securities 
    
  We utilize third-party valuation service providers to measure the fair value of our investment securities, which are classified as available-for-sale or as trading and other and consist primarily of bonds. Whenever available, we obtain quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure investment securities at fair value. We generally obtain market price data from exchange or dealer markets. 
    
  We estimate the fair value of fixed maturity investment securities not traded in active markets by referring to traded securities with similar attributes, using dealer quotations and a matrix pricing methodology, or discounted cash flow analyses. This methodology considers such factors as the issuer s industry, the security s rating and tenor, its coupon rate, its position in the capital structure of the issuer, yield curves, credit curves, composite ratings, bid-ask spreads, prepayment rates and other relevant factors. For fixed maturity investment securities that are not traded in active markets or that are subject to transfer restrictions, we adjust the valuations to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management s best estimate is used. 
    
  We elect the fair value option for investment securities that are deemed to incorporate an embedded derivative and for which it is impracticable for us to isolate and/or value the derivative. 
    
  The fair value of certain investment securities is based on the amortized cost, which is assumed to approximate fair value. 
    
  Finance Receivables 
    
  The fair value of net finance receivables, less allowance for finance receivable losses, both non-impaired and purchased credit impaired, are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies. The application of these methodologies requires us to make certain judgments and estimates based on our perception of market participant views related to the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of our finance receivables, and other similar factors. The most significant judgments and estimates made relate to prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, and discount rates. The degree of judgment and estimation applied is significant in light of the current capital markets and, more broadly, economic environments. Therefore, the fair value of our finance receivables could not be determined with precision and may not be  
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

realized in an actual sale. Additionally, there may be inherent limitations in the valuation methodologies we employed, and changes in the underlying assumptions used could significantly affect the results of current or future values. 
    
  Finance Receivables Held for Sale 
    
  We determined the fair value of finance receivables held for sale that were originated as held for investment based on negotiations with prospective purchasers (if any) or by using projected cash flows discounted at the weighted-average interest rates offered by us in the market for similar finance receivables. We based cash flows on contractual payment terms adjusted for estimates of prepayments and credit related losses. 
    
  Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  The carrying amount of restricted cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. 
    
  Notes Receivable from Parent and Affiliates 
    
  The carrying amount of the notes receivable from parent and affiliates approximates the fair value because the notes are payable on a demand basis prior to their due dates and the interest rates on these notes adjust with changing market interest rates. 
    
  Commercial Mortgage Loans 
    
  Given the short remaining average life of the portfolio, the carrying amount of commercial mortgage loans approximates fair value. The carrying amount includes an estimate for credit related losses, which is based on independent third-party valuations. 
    
  Real Estate Owned 
    
  We initially base our estimate of the fair value on independent third-party valuations at the time we take title to real estate owned. Subsequent changes in fair value are based upon independent third-party valuations obtained periodically to estimate a price that would be received in a then current transaction to sell the asset. 
    
  Escrow Advance Receivable 
    
  The carrying amount of escrow advance receivable approximates fair value. 
    
  Receivables from Parent and Affiliates 
    
  The carrying amount of receivables from parent and affiliates approximates fair value. 
    
  Receivables Related to Sales of Real Estate Loans and Related Trust Assets 
    
  The carrying amount of receivables related to sales of real estate loans and related trust assets less estimated forfeitures, which are reflected in other liabilities, approximates fair value. 
    
  Long-term Debt 
    
  We either receive fair value measurements of our long-term debt from market participants and pricing services or we estimate the fair values of long-term debt using projected cash flows discounted at each balance sheet date s market-observable implicit-credit spread rates for our long-term debt. 
    
  We record at fair value long-term debt issuances that are deemed to incorporate an embedded derivative and for which it is impracticable for us to isolate and/or value the derivative. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   debt carried at fair value under the fair value option. 
    
  We estimate the fair values associated with variable rate revolving lines of credit to be equal to par. 
    
  Payables to Parent and Affiliates 
    
  The fair value of payable to parent and affiliates approximates the carrying value due to its short-term nature.

Overview     
    
  Springleaf is a branch-based consumer finance company providing personal loans primarily to non-prime customers through its network of over 700 branch offices in   28   states as of   September 30, 2016   and on a centralized basis as part of its centralized operations and our iLoan platform (our online consumer loan origination business). We also write credit and non-credit insurance policies covering our customers and the property pledged as collateral for our personal loans. 
    
  OUR PRODUCTS 
    
  Our product offerings include: 

Personal Loans     We offer personal loans through our branch network and over the internet through our centralized operations to customers who generally need timely access to cash. Our personal loans are typically non-revolving with a fixed-rate and a fixed, original term of   two   to   five years   and are secured by consumer goods, automobiles, or other personal property or are unsecured. At   September 30, 2016  , we had over   941,000   personal loans, representing   $4.8 billion   of net finance receivables, of which 81% were secured by collateral, compared to   890,000   personal loans totaling   $4.3 billion   at December 31, 2015, of which 74% were secured by collateral. Personal loans held for sale totaled $617 million at December 31, 2015. 

Insurance Products     We offer our customers credit insurance (life insurance, disability insurance, and involuntary unemployment insurance) and non-credit insurance through both our branch network and our centralized operations. Credit insurance and non-credit insurance products are provided by our subsidiaries, Merit Life Insurance Co. ( Merit ) and Yosemite Insurance Company ( Yosemite ). We also offer auto warranty membership plans of an unaffiliated company as an ancillary product. 
       
  Our products also included the SpringCastle Portfolio at December 31, 2015, as described below: 

SpringCastle Portfolio     SFI services the SpringCastle Portfolio that was acquired by an indirect subsidiary of OMH through a joint venture in which SFC previously owned a   47%   equity interest. On March 31, 2016, the SpringCastle Portfolio was sold in connection with the SpringCastle Interests Sale. These loans consisted of unsecured loans and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages and include both closed-end accounts and open-end  
     
   57 

     Table of Contents  

lines of credit. These loans were in a liquidating status and varied in substance and form from our originated loans. Unless SFI is terminated, SFI will continue to provide the servicing for these loans pursuant to a servicing agreement, which SFI services as unsecured loans due to the fact that the liens are subordinated to superior ranking security interests. 
    
  Our non-originating legacy products include: 

Real Estate Loans     We ceased real estate lending in January of 2012, and during 2014, we sold $6.3 billion real estate loans held for sale, and in connection with the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale, we sold a portfolio of second lien mortgage loans with a carrying value of $250 million. The remaining real estate loans may be closed-end accounts or open-end home equity lines of credit, generally have a fixed rate and maximum original terms of 360 months, and are secured by first or second mortgages on residential real estate. Our first lien mortgages are serviced by third-party servicers, and we continue to provide servicing for our second lien mortgages (home equity lines of credit). At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $201 million   of real estate loans held for investment, of which 94% were secured by first mortgages, compared to   $538 million   at December 31, 2015, of which 38% were secured by first mortgages. Real estate loans held for sale totaled   $166 million   and $176 million at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Retail Sales Finance     We ceased purchasing retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts in January of 2013. We continue to service the liquidating retail sales contracts and will provide revolving retail sales financing services on our revolving retail accounts. We refer to retail sales contracts and revolving retail accounts collectively as  retail sales finance.  
       
  OUR SEGMENTS 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had three operating segments: 

Consumer and Insurance; 
                
    Acquisitions and Servicing; and 
                
    Real Estate. 
       
  See Note   16   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our segments. 

Recent Developments and Outlook     
    
  ONEMAIN ACQUISITION 
    
  On November 15, 2015, OMH completed its acquisition of OMFH from Citigroup for approximately $4.5 billion in cash. As a result of the OneMain Acquisition, OMFH became a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of OMH. 
    
  On November 12, 2015, in connection with the closing of the OneMain Acquisition, SFC s wholly owned subsidiary, CSI, entered into the Independence Demand Note with Independence, whereby CSI provided Independence with $3.4 billion cash pursuant to the terms of the Independence Demand Note. See Note   9   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Independence Demand Note and other related party agreements with OMFH. 
    
  SPRINGCASTLE INTERESTS SALE 
    
  On March 31, 2016, the SpringCastle Sellers, wholly owned subsidiaries of OMH, entered into a purchase agreement with the SpringCastle Buyers. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, SpringCastle Holdings sold its 47% limited liability company interest in each of SpringCastle America, LLC, SpringCastle Credit, LLC and SpringCastle Finance, LLC, and Springleaf Acquisition sold its 47% limited liability company interest in SpringCastle Acquisition LLC, to the SpringCastle Buyers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $112 million. 
    
  As a result of this sale, SpringCastle Acquisition and SpringCastle Holdings no longer hold any ownership interests of the SpringCastle Joint Venture. However, unless SFI is terminated, SFI will remain as servicer of the SpringCastle Portfolio under the servicing agreement for the SpringCastle Funding Trust. 
    
  See Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the SpringCastle Interests Sale.

LENDMARK SALE 
    
  On November 12, 2015, the Branch Sellers entered into a purchase and sale agreement with respect to the Lendmark Sale, and on May 2, 2016, the Branch Sellers completed the sale of 127 Springleaf branches to Lendmark for an aggregate cash purchase price of $624 million. On this date, SFC used a portion of the proceeds from the Lendmark Sale to repay, in full, its revolving demand note with OMFH, which totaled $  376 million   (including interest payable of $  6 million  ) on May 2, 2016. See Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Lendmark Sale. 
    
  REAL ESTATE LOAN SALE 
    
  In connection with the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale, we sold a portfolio of second lien mortgage loans for aggregate cash proceeds of $246 million and recorded a net loss in other revenues at the time of sale of   $4 million  . The proceeds from this sale, together with cash on hand, were used to pay off $375 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes that matured in the third quarter of 2016. Unless we are terminated or we resign as servicer, we will continue to service the loans included in this sale pursuant to a servicing agreement. The purchase and sale agreement and the servicing agreement include customary representations and warranties and indemnification provisions. 
    
  LIQUIDATION OF UNITED KINGDOM SUBSIDIARY 
    
  On August 16, 2016, we liquidated our United Kingdom subsidiary, Ocean Finance and Mortgages Limited, which had previously ceased originating real estate loans in 2012. In connection with this liquidation, we recorded a net gain in other revenues on the date of liquidation of $5 million resulting from a net realized foreign currency translation gain. 
    
  OUTLOOK 
    
  Assuming the U.S. economy continues to experience slow to moderate growth, we expect to continue our long history of strong credit performance and believe the strong credit quality of our loan portfolio will continue as the result of our disciplined underwriting practices and ongoing collection efforts. We also continue to see growth in the volume of secured loan originations, driven by our strategy to increase the proportion of our loan originations that are secured loans in order to mitigate credit risk exposure and the migration of customer activity from traditional channels, such as direct mail to online channels (primarily serviced through our branch network), where we believe we are well suited to capture volume due to our scale, technology, and deployment of advanced analytics. 
    
  In addition, with an experienced management team, long track record of successfully accessing the capital markets, and strong demand for consumer credit, we believe we are well positioned to execute on our strategic priorities of strengthening our capital base through the following key initiatives: 

Reducing leverage; 
                
    Maintaining a strong liquidity level and diversified funding sources; and 
                
    Optimizing non-core assets.

Comparison of Consolidated Results for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  Interest income     decreased   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   due to the net of the following: 

Average net receivables     decreased   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to (i) the SpringCastle Interests Sale, (ii) the Lendmark Sale, and (iii) our liquidating real estate loan portfolio, including the transfer of $257 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale on June 30, 2016. This   decrease   was partially offset by the continued growth of our loan portfolio (primarily of our secured personal loans). 

Yield     decreased   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to (i) the continued growth of secured personal loans, which generally have lower yields relative to our unsecured personal loans, and (ii) the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale of second lien mortgage loans, which generally had higher yields relative to our remaining real estate loans. 

Interest income on finance receivables held for sale     increased   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the transfer of $257 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale on June 30, 2016, which were sold on August 3, 2016. 
       
  Interest expense     decreased   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   due to the net of the following:

Average debt     decreased   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to (i) the elimination of the debt associated with the SpringCastle Interests Sale and (ii) net debt repurchases and repayment during the past 12 months relating to our consumer securitization transactions and conduit facilities. This   decrease   was partially offset by net unsecured debt issued during the past 12 months. See Notes   10   and   11   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our long-term debt, consumer loan securitization transactions and our conduit facilities. 

Weighted average interest rate on our debt     increased   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to (i) SFC s offering of the 8.25% SFC Notes in April of 2016 and (ii) the elimination of debt associated with the SpringCastle Interests Sale, which generally had a lower interest rate relative to our other indebtedness. The increase was partially offset by the repurchase of $600 million unsecured notes, which had a higher interest rate relative to our other indebtedness, in connection with SFC s offering of the 8.25% SFC Notes. 

Interest expense on note payable to affiliate   resulted from a revolving demand note agreement between SFC and OMFH, entered into on December 1, 2015. See Note   9   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this note.

Provision for finance receivable losses     increased     $9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to higher net charge-offs on our personal loans reflecting growth during the past 12 months. This increase was partially offset by the absence of net charge-offs on the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio. 
    
  Other revenues     increased     $58 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to the net of (i) higher interest income on notes receivable from parent and affiliates of   $51 million   primarily reflecting interest income on the Cash Services Note (previously referred to as the  Independence Demand Note ) during the 2016 period, (ii) foreign currency translation adjustment gain of $5 million in the 2016 period resulting from the liquidation of our United Kingdom subsidiary, (iii) lower net charge-offs on our finance receivables held for sale and provision adjustments for liquidated held for sale accounts of $3 million during the 2016 period, and (iv) net loss on the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale of   $4 million   in the 2016 period. 
    
  Other expenses     decreased     $27 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   due to the net of the following: 

Salaries and benefits     decreased     $5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to a decrease in average staffing as a result of the Lendmark Sale in May of 2016. 

Other operating expenses     decreased     $12 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to three months of servicing expenses for the SpringCastle Portfolio totaling $13 million during the 2015 period. 

Insurance policy benefits and claims     decreased     $10 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves during the 2016 period. 
       
  Provision for income taxes   totaled   $10 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $5 million for the same period in   2015  . The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   29.6%   compared to   13.6%   for the same period in   2015  . The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of discrete tax benefits from our early implementation of ASU 2016-09 (see Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this ASU) and the income tax treatment of the net realized foreign currency translation gain arising from our United Kingdom subsidiary liquidation. The effective tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the non-controlling interests in the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio. As discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, on March 31, 2016, the Company sold its equity interest in the SpringCastle Portfolio. 
    
  Comparison of Consolidated Results for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  Interest income     decreased   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   due to the net of the following: 

Average net receivables     decreased   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to (i) the SpringCastle Interests Sale, (ii) the transfer of   $608 million   of our personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015, and (iii) our liquidating real estate loan portfolio, including the transfer of $257 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale on June 30, 2016. This   decrease   was partially offset by the continued growth of our loan portfolio (primarily of our secured personal loans). 

Yield     decreased   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to (i) the continued growth of secured personal loans, which generally have lower yields relative to our unsecured personal loans, and (ii) the August 2016

  Provision for finance receivable losses     increased     $33 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to higher net charge-offs on our personal loans reflecting growth during the past 12 months. This increase was partially offset by (i) lower net charge-offs on the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio reflecting the SpringCastle Interests Sale and the improved central servicing performance as the acquired portfolio matured under our ownership and (ii) lower net charge-offs on our real estate loans reflecting the liquidating status of the real estate loan portfolio and the transfer of $257 million of real estate loans to finance receivables held for sale on June 30, 2016. 
    
  Net gain on sale of SpringCastle interests   of   $167 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflected the net gain associated with the sale of our equity interest in the SpringCastle Joint Venture on March 31, 2016. See Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the sale. 
    
  Other revenues     increased     $140 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   due to the net of (i)   increase   in interest income on notes receivable from parent and affiliates of   $147 million   reflecting interest income on the Cash Services Note during the 2016 period and higher interest income on SFC s note receivable from SFI reflecting additional SFI borrowings during the 2016 period to fund the operations of its subsidiaries, (ii) net   gain   on sales of personal and real estate loans of   $18 million   in the 2016 period, (iii) increase in insurance revenues of $6 million during the 2016 period reflecting higher earned credit premiums, (iv) foreign currency translation adjustment gain of $5 million in the 2016 period resulting from the liquidation of our United Kingdom subsidiary, (v)   decrease   in investment revenues of   $21 million   during the 2016 period primarily due to lower realized gains on the sale of investment securities and a decrease in invested assets, and (vi) net   loss   on repurchases and repayments of debt of   $16 million   in the 2016 period.

Other expenses     decreased     $14 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to the net of the following: 

Salaries and benefits     decreased     $1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to non-cash incentive compensation expense of $15 million recorded in the second quarter of 2015 relating to the rights of certain executives to receive a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of OMH s common stock by the Initial Stockholder. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in average staffing during the 2016 period prior to the Lendmark Sale. 

Other operating expenses     increased     $1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to (i) an increase in professional fees of $10 million during the 2016 period primarily reflecting debt refinance costs, (ii) an increase in information technology expenses of $7 million during the 2016 period, (iii) a decrease in deferred origination costs of $7 million, and (iv) an increase in advertising expenses of $7 million during the 2016 period. This   increase   was partially offset by six additional months of servicing expenses for the SpringCastle Portfolio totaling $29 million during the 2015 period. 

Insurance policy benefits and claims     decreased     $14 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves during the 2016 period. 
       
  Provision for income taxes   totaled   $101 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $14 million   for the same period in   2015  . The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   33.6%   compared to   11.6%   for the same period in   2015  . The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the non-controlling interests in the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the non-controlling interests in the previously owned SpringCastle Portfolio. The effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   differed from the same period in   2015   primarily due to the SpringCastle Interests Sale. As discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, on March 31, 2016, the Company sold its equity interest in the SpringCastle Portfolio. 
    
  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
    
  Segment Accounting Basis    
    
  We report the operating results of Consumer and Insurance, Acquisitions and Servicing, Real Estate, and Other using the Segment Accounting Basis, which (i) reflects our allocation methodologies for certain costs, primarily interest expense, loan loss reserves and acquisition costs to reflect the manner in which we assess our business results and (ii) excludes the impact of applying purchase accounting (eliminates premiums/discounts on our finance receivables at acquisition, as well as the amortization/accretion in future periods). These allocations and adjustments currently have a material effect on our reported segment basis income as compared to GAAP. See Note   16   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our segment accounting. We believe the Segment Accounting Basis (a basis other than GAAP) provides investors a consistent basis on which management evaluates segment performance. 

64 

     Table of Contents  

The reconciliations of income before provision for income taxes attributable to SFC on a GAAP basis (purchase accounting) to the same amounts under a Segment Accounting Basis were as follows: 

(a) 
    The GAAP to Segment Accounting Basis adjustments primarily consists of: 

Interest income   - reverses the impact of premiums/discounts on non-impaired purchased finance receivables and the interest income recognition under guidance in ASC 310-20,   Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs  , and reestablishes interest income recognition on a historical cost basis; 

Interest expense   - reverses the impact of premiums/discounts on acquired long-term debt and reestablishes interest expense recognition on a historical cost basis; 

Provision for finance receivable losses   - reverses the impact of providing an allowance for finance receivable losses upon acquisition and reestablishes the allowance on a historical cost basis and reverses the impact of recognition of net charge-offs on purchased credit impaired finance receivables and reestablishes the net charge-offs on a historical cost basis; 

Other revenues   - reestablishes the historical cost basis of mark-to-market adjustments on finance receivables held for sale and on realized gains/losses associated with our investment portfolio; and 

Other expenses   - reestablishes expenses on a historical cost basis by reversing the impact of amortization from acquired intangible assets and including amortization of other historical deferred costs. 
       
           (b) 
    Purchase accounting was not elected at the segment level. 
       
  We also report selected financial statistics relating to the net finance receivables and credit quality of Consumer and Insurance, Acquisitions and Servicing, Real Estate, and Other using a Segment Accounting Basis. 
    
  Adjusted Pretax Earnings (Loss) 
    
  Management uses   adjusted pretax earnings (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a key performance measure of our segments. Adjusted pretax earnings (loss) represents income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes on a Segment Accounting Basis and excludes net gain (loss) on sales of personal and real estate loans, net gain on sale of SpringCastle interests, SpringCastle transaction costs, losses resulting from accelerated repayment and repurchases of long-term debt, debt refinance costs, and net loss on liquidation of our United Kingdom subsidiary. Management believes adjusted pretax earnings (loss) is useful in assessing the profitability of our segments and uses adjusted pretax earnings (loss) in evaluating our operating performance. Adjusted pretax earnings (loss) is   a non-GAAP measure and should be considered supplemental to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net income, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

  Comparison of Pretax Operating Results for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  Interest income  , which consisted entirely of finance charges,   increased     $2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the net of the following: 

Average net receivables   increased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the continued growth of our loan portfolio (primarily of our secured personal loans). This increase was partially offset by the Lendmark Sale.

     Table of Contents  

Yield   decreased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the continued growth of secured personal loans, which generally have lower yields relative to our unsecured personal loans. 
       
  Interest expense     increased     $62 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to a change in the methodology of allocating interest expense, as described in the allocation methodologies table in Note   16   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Provision for finance receivable losses     increased     $22 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to higher net charge-offs on our personal loans reflecting growth during the past 12 months. 
    
  Other expenses     decreased     $11 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the net of the following: 

Salaries and benefits     decrease  d   $4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to a decrease in average staffing as a result of the Lendmark Sale in May of 2016. 

Other operating expenses     increased     $3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to a decrease in deferred origination costs of $4 million. 

Insurance policy benefits and claims     decreased     $10 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves during the 2016 period. 
       
  Comparison of Pretax Operating Results for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  Interest income     increased     $87 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the following: 

Finance charges     increased     $31 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the net of the following: 

Average net receivables   increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the continued growth of our loan portfolio (primarily of our secured personal loans). This increase was partially offset by the transfer of $608 million of our personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015. 

Yield   decreased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the continued growth of secured personal loans, which generally have lower yields relative to our unsecured personal loans. 

Interest income on finance receivables held for sale   of   $56 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   resulted from the transfer of personal loans to finance receivables held for sale on September 30, 2015 and sold in the Lendmark Sale on May 2, 2016. 
       
  Interest expense     increased     $180 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to a change in the methodology of allocating interest expense, as described in the allocation methodologies table in Note   16   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Provision for finance receivable losses     increased     $70 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to higher net charge-offs on our personal loans during the 2016 period reflecting growth during the past 12 months. 
    
  Other revenues     decrease  d   $7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same period in   2015   due to the net of (i) a   decrease   in investment revenues of   $15 million   during the 2016 period resulting from lower realized gains on the sale of investment securities and a decrease in invested assets, (ii) an   increase   in insurance revenues of   $6 million   during the 2016 period reflecting higher earned credit premiums, and (iii) and an   increase   in remaining other revenue of   $2 million   during the 2016 period primarily resulting from income generated from the Lendmark Sale. 
    
  Other expenses     increased     $35 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due to the net of the following: 

Salaries and benefits     increase  d   $14 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to an increase in average staffing during the 2016 period prior to the Lendmark Sale.

     Table of Contents  

Other operating expenses     increase  d   $34 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to (i) an increase credit and collection related costs of $10 million in the 2016 period reflecting growth in our loan portfolio, (ii) an increase in professional fees of $9 million during the 2016 period reflecting debt refinance costs and increased business efforts, (iii) an increase in information technology expenses of $8 million during the 2016 period, and (iv) an increase in advertising expenses of $7 million during the 2016 period. 

Insurance policy benefits and claims     decreased     $13 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to favorable variances in benefit reserves during the 2016 period.

REAL ESTATE 
    
  Adjusted pretax operating results and selected financial statistics for Real Estate (which are reported on an adjusted Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows: 

(a) 
    Interest expense     decreased     $50 million   and   $142 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, when compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to a change in the methodology of allocating interest expense, as described in the allocation methodologies table in Note   16   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reallocation of interest expense to the Consumer and Insurance segment as a result of the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale. 
       
           (b) 
    Other revenues     decreased     $21 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to (i) impairments of $10 million recognized on our real estate loans held for sale during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and (ii) a decrease in investment revenues during the 2016 period, as the prior period reflected higher investment income generated from investing the proceeds of the 2014 real estate loan sales. 
       
           (c) 
    See  Key Financial Definitions  at the end of our management's discussion and analysis for formulas and definitions of key performance ratios.

  OTHER 
    
   Other  consists of our other non-originating legacy operations, which are isolated by geographic market and/or distribution channel from our three segments. These operations include: (i) our legacy operations in   14   states where we had also ceased branch-based personal lending during 2012; (ii) our liquidating retail sales finance portfolio (including retail sales finance accounts from its legacy auto finance operation); (iii) our lending operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; and (iv) the operations of our United Kingdom subsidiary prior to its liquidation on August 16, 2016.

    Interest expense   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in   2015   reflected a change in the methodology of allocating interest expense, as described in the allocation methodologies table in Note   16   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
       
           (b) 
    Other revenues   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily included (i) interest income on the Cash Services Note and (ii) interest income on SFC s note receivable from SFI reflecting additional SFI borrowings during the 2016 period to fund the operations of its subsidiaries. See Note   9   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Cash Services Note (previously referred to as the  Independence Demand Note ). 
       
           (c) 
    In connection with the sale of our common stock by the Initial Stockholder, we recorded non-cash incentive compensation expense of $15 million in the second quarter of 2015 relating to the rights of certain executives to   receive   a portion of the cash proceeds received by the Initial Stockholder. 
       
  Net finance receivables of the Other components (which are reported on a Segment Accounting Basis) were as follows: 

Credit Quality     
    
  Our customers encompass a wide range of borrowers. In the consumer finance industry, they are described as prime or near-prime at one extreme and non-prime or sub-prime (less creditworthy) at the other. Our customers  incomes are generally near the national median but our customers may vary from national norms as to their debt-to-income ratios, employment and residency stability, and/or credit repayment histories. In general, our customers have lower credit quality and require significant levels of servicing. 
    
  We may offer borrowers the opportunity to defer their personal loan by extending the date on which any payment is due. We may require a partial payment prior to granting such a deferral. Deferments must bring the account contractually current or due for the current month s payment. Borrowers are generally limited to two deferments in a rolling 12-month period unless it is determined that an exception is warranted. 
    
  In addition to deferrals, we may also offer borrowers the opportunity to cure delinquent accounts when a customer demonstrates that he or she has rehabilitated from a temporary event that caused the delinquency. An account may be brought to current status after the cause for delinquency has been identified and remediated and the customer has made two consecutive qualified payments; however, no principal or interest amounts are forgiven or credited. Independent risk management approval is required for all cures. 

71 

     Table of Contents  

When a loan is 60 days past due, we transfer the loan to one of our centralized service centers for account servicing and collection processing. This process includes assessing previous collection efforts, contacting the customer to determine whether the customer s financial problems are temporary, reviewing the collateral securing the loan and developing a plan to maintain contact with the customer to increase the likelihood of future payments. Certain non-routine collection activities may include litigation, repossession of collateral, or filing involuntary bankruptcy petitions. 
    
  We may renew a delinquent personal loan if the related borrower meets current underwriting criteria and we determine that it does not appear that the cause of past delinquency will affect the customer s ability to repay the new personal loan. We employ the same credit risk underwriting process that we would use for an application from a new customer to determine whether to grant a renewal of a personal loan, regardless of whether the borrower s account is current or delinquent. 
    
  We consider the delinquency status of the finance receivable as our primary credit quality indicator. We monitor delinquency trends to manage our exposure to credit risk. Although we engage in collection activities well before an account is 60 days past due, we consider finance receivables 60 days or more past due as delinquent and consider the likelihood of collection to decrease at such time. We record an allowance for loan losses to cover expected losses on our finance receivables. See table of net finance receivables held for investment by type and by number of days delinquent in Note   4   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING 
    
  We make modifications to our finance receivables to assist borrowers during times of financial difficulties. When we modify a loan s contractual terms for economic or other reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties and grant a concession that we would not otherwise consider, we classify that loan as a TDR finance receivable. 
    
  Information regarding TDR finance receivables held for investment and held for sale were as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources     
    
  SOURCES OF FUNDS 
    
  We finance the majority of our operating liquidity and capital needs through a combination of cash flows from operations, securitization debt, borrowings from conduit facilities, unsecured debt and equity, and may also utilize other corporate debt facilities in the future. As a holding company, all of the funds generated from our operations are earned by our operating subsidiaries. 
    
  SFC s Offering of 8.25% Senior Notes 
    
  On April 11, 2016, SFC issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% SFC Notes due 2020 under the Indenture, pursuant to which OMH provided a guarantee of the notes on a senior unsecured basis. SFC used a portion of the proceeds from the offering to repurchase approximately $600 million aggregate principal amount of its existing senior notes that mature in 2017 and the remainder for general corporate purposes. See Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this offering. 
    
  Securitizations and Borrowings from Revolving Conduit Facilities 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we (i) completed one auto securitization, (ii) exercised our right to redeem the asset backed notes issued by the Springleaf Funding Trust 2013-B, and (iii) deconsolidated the previously issued securitized interests of the SpringCastle Funding Asset-backed Notes 2014-A. See  Structured Financings  later in this section for further information on each of our securitization transactions. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we (i) extended the revolving periods on four existing revolving conduit facilities and (ii) amended three existing revolving conduit facilities to change the maximum principal balances. Net repayments under the notes of our existing revolving conduit facilities totaled $1.2 billion for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  See Notes   10   and   11   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our long-term debt, consumer loan securitization transactions and conduit facilities. 
    
  Other Transactions 
    
  In addition to cash received from our senior notes offering and securitization transactions, our sources of funds were favorably impacted by the following transactions: 

SpringCastle Interests Sale; 
                
    Lendmark Sale; and 
        
  See Note   2   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these transactions. 
    
  USES OF FUNDS 
    
  Our operating subsidiaries  primary cash needs relate to funding our lending activities, our debt service obligations, our operating expenses, payment of insurance claims and, to a lesser extent, expenditures relating to upgrading and monitoring our technology platform, risk systems, and branch locations. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $272 million   of cash and cash equivalents, and during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated net income attributable to SFC of   $172 million  . Our net cash inflow from operating and investing activities totaled   $1.3 billion     for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , our remaining scheduled interest payments for 2016 on our existing debt (excluding securitizations) totaled   $156 million  , and we had no remaining scheduled principal payments for 2016 on our existing debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.2 billion   UPB of unencumbered personal loans and   $439 million   UPB of unencumbered real estate loans (including   $230 million   held for sale). 
    
  Based on our estimates and taking into account the risks and uncertainties of our plans, we believe that we will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate our businesses and repay our obligations as they become due for at least the next 12 months.

We have previously purchased portions of our unsecured indebtedness, and we may elect to purchase additional portions of our unsecured indebtedness in the future. Future purchases may be made through the open market, privately negotiated transactions with third parties, or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers, all of which are subject to terms, prices, and consideration we may determine. 
    
  LIQUIDITY 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operations of   $399 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflected net income of   $200 million  , the impact of non-cash items, and a favorable change in working capital of   $89 million  . Net cash provided by operations of   $421 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   reflected net income of   $108 million  , the impact of non-cash items, and a favorable change in working capital of   $15 million  . 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by investing activities of   $897 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the SpringCastle Interests Sale, the Lendmark Sale, the August 2016 Real Estate Loan Sale, and net principal collections on intercompany notes receivable, partially offset by net principal collections and originations of finance receivables held for investment and held for sale. Net cash provided by investing activities of   $565 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily attributable to net sales of investment securities during 2015. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash used for financing activities of   $1.3 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to net repayments of long-term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities of $  1.0 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   reflected the debt issuances associated with the 2015-A and 2015-B securitizations. 
    
  Liquidity Risks and Strategies 
    
  SFC s credit ratings are non-investment grade, which have a significant impact on our cost of, and access to, capital. This, in turn, can negatively affect our ability to manage our liquidity and our ability or cost to refinance our indebtedness. 
    
  There are numerous risks to our financial results, liquidity, capital raising, and debt refinancing plans, some of which may not be quantified in our current liquidity forecasts. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following: 

our inability to grow or maintain our personal loan portfolio with adequate profitability; 
                
    the effect of federal, state and local laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and practices; 
                
    potential liability relating to real estate and personal loans which we have sold or may sell in the future, or relating to securitized loans; and 
                
    the potential for disruptions in the debt and equity markets. 
       
  The principal factors that could decrease our liquidity are customer delinquencies and defaults, a decline in customer prepayments, and a prolonged inability to adequately access capital market funding. We intend to support our liquidity position by utilizing some or all the following strategies: 

maintaining disciplined underwriting standards and pricing for loans we originate or purchase and managing purchases of finance receivables; 
                
    pursuing additional debt financings (including new securitizations and new unsecured debt issuances, debt refinancing transactions and standby funding facilities), or a combination of the foregoing; 
                
    purchasing portions of our outstanding indebtedness through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices, as well as with such consideration, as we may determine; and 
                
    obtaining new and extending existing secured revolving facilities to provide committed liquidity in case of prolonged market fluctuations. 
       
  However, it is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of our plans could be materially different than expected or that one or more of our significant judgments or estimates could prove to be materially incorrect.

OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES 
    
  State law restricts the amounts our insurance subsidiaries, Merit and Yosemite, may pay as dividends without prior notice to the Indiana Department of Insurance (the  Indiana DOI ). The maximum amount of dividends (referred to as  ordinary dividends ) for an Indiana domiciled life insurance company that can be paid without prior approval in a 12-month period (measured retrospectively from the date of payment) is the greater of: (i) 10% of policyholders  surplus as of the prior year-end; or (ii) the statutory net gain from operations as of the prior year-end. Any amount greater must be approved by the Indiana DOI prior to its payment. The maximum ordinary dividends for an Indiana domiciled property and casualty insurance company that can be paid without prior approval in a 12-month period (measured retrospectively from the date of payment) is the greater of: (i) 10% of policyholders  surplus as of the prior year-end; or (ii) the statutory net income. Any amount greater must be approved by the Indiana DOI prior to its payment. These approved dividends are called  extraordinary dividends.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Merit and Yosemite paid extraordinary dividends to SFC totaling $63 million. 
    
  OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS 
    
  The debt agreements to which SFC and its subsidiaries are a party include customary terms and conditions, including covenants and representations and warranties. Some or all of these agreements also contain certain restrictions, including (i) restrictions on the ability to create senior liens on property and assets in connection with any new debt financings and (ii) SFC s ability to sell or convey all or substantially all of its assets, unless the transferee assumes SFC s obligations under the applicable debt agreement. In addition, the OMH guarantees of SFC s long-term debt discussed above are subject to customary release provisions. 
    
  With the exception of SFC s junior subordinated debenture, none of our debt agreements require SFC or any of its subsidiaries to meet or maintain any specific financial targets or ratios. However, certain events, including non-payment of principal or interest, bankruptcy or insolvency, or a breach of a covenant or a representation or warranty may constitute an event of default and trigger an acceleration of payments. In some cases, an event of default or acceleration of payments under one debt agreement may constitute a cross-default under other debt agreements resulting in an acceleration of payments under the other agreements. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , SFC was in compliance with all of the covenants under its debt agreements. 
    
  Junior Subordinated Debenture.   In January of 2007, SFC issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 60-year junior subordinated debenture (the  debenture ) under an indenture dated January 22, 2007 (the  Junior Subordinated Indenture ), by and between SFC and Deutsche Bank Trust Company, as trustee. The debenture underlies the trust preferred securities sold by a trust sponsored by SFC. SFC can redeem the debenture at par beginning in January of 2017. 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the debenture, SFC, upon the occurrence of a mandatory trigger event, is required to defer interest payments to the holders of the debenture (and not make dividend payments to SFI) unless SFC obtains non-debt capital funding in an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid interest on the debenture otherwise payable on the next interest payment date and pays such amount to the holders of the debenture. A mandatory trigger event occurs if SFC s (i) tangible equity to tangible managed assets is less than 5.5% or (ii) average fixed charge ratio is not more than 1.10x for the trailing four quarters. 
    
  Based upon SFC s financial results for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, a mandatory trigger event did not occur with respect to the interest payment due in January of 2017, as SFC was in compliance with both required ratios discussed above.

  In addition to the structured financings included in the table above, we had access to seven conduit facilities with a total borrowing capacity of $2.4 billion as of   September 30, 2016  , as discussed in Note   11   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. At   September 30, 2016  , no amounts were drawn under these facilities. 
    
  See  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources of Funds - Securitizations and Borrowings from Revolving Conduit Facilities  for securitization and conduit transactions completed subsequent to   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Our securitizations have served to partially replace secured and unsecured debt in our capital structure with more favorable non-recourse funding. Our overall funding costs are positively impacted by our increased usage of securitizations, as we typically execute these transactions at interest rates significantly below those of our maturing unsecured debt. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     
    
  We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by SEC rules. We had no off-balance sheet exposure to losses associated with unconsolidated VIEs at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , other than certain representations and warranties associated with the sales of the mortgage-backed retained certificates during 2014. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   repurchase activity related to these sales.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     
    
  We describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. We consider the following policies to be our most critical accounting policies because they involve critical accounting estimates and a significant degree of management judgment: 

allowance for finance receivable losses; 
                
    purchased credit impaired finance receivables; 
                
    TDR finance receivables; and 
                
    fair value measurements. 
       
  Effective April 1, 2016, we changed our accounting policy for derecognition of purchased credit impaired loans. See Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
    
  There have been no other material changes to our critical accounting policies or to our methodologies for deriving critical accounting estimates during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements     
    
  See Note   3   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 

Seasonality     
    
  Our personal loan volume is generally highest during the second and fourth quarters of the year, primarily due to marketing efforts, seasonality of demand, and increased traffic in branches after the winter months. Demand for our personal loans is usually lower in January and February after the holiday season and as a result of tax refunds. Delinquencies on our personal loans are generally lowest in the first quarter and tend to rise throughout the remainder of the year. These seasonal trends contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and cash needs throughout the year.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. This evaluation was conducted under the supervision of, and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   to provide the reasonable assurance described above. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.     
    
  See Note   14   of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.     
    
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for changes previously disclosed in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, filed with the SEC on August 5, 2016, and as set forth below: 
    
  OMH s OneMain Acquisition may not achieve its intended results and indirectly have an adverse impact on us. 
    
  On November 15, 2015, OMH, our indirect parent, completed its acquisition of OneMain, with the expectation that the OneMain Acquisition will result in various benefits including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the OneMain Acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties (many of which are outside of our control and are outside of the control of OMH and OneMain), including whether the business of OneMain can be integrated into OMH s business, including SFC, in an efficient and effective manner. 
    
  The integration process is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described under  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of OMH s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of OMH s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016, filed with the SEC on November 8, 2016.  No assurance can be given that OMH s anticipated benefits and synergies will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could indirectly result in an adverse impact on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 
    
  If our estimates of finance receivable losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for finance receivable losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  We maintain an allowance for finance receivable losses. To estimate the appropriate level of allowance for finance receivable losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect finance receivable collectability, including the total amount of finance receivables outstanding, historical finance receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for finance receivable losses is based on the guidance in ASC 450,   Contingencies   and, in part, on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate, housing foreclosures, and general economic uncertainty may affect our allowance for finance receivable losses, our provision may be inadequate. Our allowance for finance receivable losses is an estimate, and if actual finance receivable losses are materially greater than our allowance for finance receivable losses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for finance receivable losses. 
    
  In June of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   This ASU significantly changes the way that entities will be required to measure credit losses. The new standard requires that the estimated credit loss be based upon an  expected credit loss  approach rather than the  incurred loss  approach currently required. The new approach will require entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of collectability. It is anticipated that the expected credit loss model may require earlier recognition of credit losses than the incurred loss approach. This ASU will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2019. We believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this new accounting standard. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.     
    
  On January 11, 2016, in order to satisfy a non-debt capital funding requirement with respect to SFC s debenture, SFC issued one share of SFC common stock to SFI for $10 million. The share of SFC common stock was issued in reliance on the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. See  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Our Debt Agreements  in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on SFC s debentures.
