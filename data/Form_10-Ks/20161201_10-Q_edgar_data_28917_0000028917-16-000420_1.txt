DILLARD S, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

Note 1.               Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Dillard s, Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   January 28, 2017   due to, among other factors, the seasonal nature of the business. 
    
  These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016   filed with the SEC on March 23, 2016.  
    
  Reclassifications   -     Certain items have been reclassified from their prior year classifications to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income or stockholders' equity as previously reported.  

Note 2.  Business Segments 
    
  The Company operates in   two   reportable segments:  the operation of retail department stores ( retail operations ) and a general contracting construction company ( construction ). 
    
  For the Company s retail operations, the Company determined its operating segments on a store by store basis.  Each store s operating performance has been aggregated into   one   reportable segment.  The Company s operating segments are aggregated for financial reporting purposes because they are similar in each of the following areas: economic characteristics, class of consumer, nature of products and distribution methods. Revenues from external customers are derived from merchandise sales, and the Company does not rely on any major customers as a source of revenue. Across all stores, the Company operates   one   store format under the Dillard s name where each store offers the same general mix of merchandise with similar categories and similar customers.  The Company believes that disaggregating its operating segments would not provide meaningful additional information. 

7 

     Table of Contents  

The following tables summarize certain segment information, including the reconciliation of those items to the Company s consolidated operations:  

Intersegment construction revenues of   $22.4 million   and   $22.9 million   for the three months ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively, and   $55.5 million   and   $65.4 million   for the nine months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively, were eliminated during consolidation and have been excluded from net sales for the respective periods.

     Table of Contents  

Note 3. Earnings Per Share Data 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data).  

The Company maintains a capital structure in which common stock is the only equity security issued and outstanding, and there were   no   shares of preferred stock, stock options, other dilutive securities or potentially dilutive securities issued or outstanding during the three and nine months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  .   

Note 4.  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Various legal proceedings, in the form of lawsuits and claims, which occur in the normal course of business, are pending against the Company and its subsidiaries.  In the opinion of management, disposition of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 
    
  At   October 29, 2016  , letters of credit totaling   $26.4 million   were issued under the Company s revolving credit facility. 

Note 5.  Benefit Plans 
    
  The Company has an unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit plan ( Pension Plan ) for its officers.  The Pension Plan is noncontributory and provides benefits based on years of service and compensation during employment.  The Company determines pension expense using an actuarial cost method to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to officers and allocates this cost to service periods.  The actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually.  The Company contributed   $1.4 million   and   $3.3 million   to the Pension Plan during the   three and nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and expects to make additional contributions to the Pension Plan of approximately   $1.1 million   during the remainder of fiscal   2016  . 
    
  The components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows (in thousands):  

Net periodic benefit costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  

Note 6.  Revolving Credit Agreement 
    
  At   October 29, 2016  , the Company maintained a   $1.0 billion   unsecured revolving credit facility ( credit agreement ). The credit agreement matures on May 13, 2020 and is available to the Company for working capital needs and general corporate purposes. The Company pays a variable rate of interest on borrowings under the credit agreement and a commitment fee to the participating banks based on the Company's debt rating. The rate of interest on borrowings is   LIBOR   plus   1.375%  , and the commitment fee for unused borrowings is   0.20%   per annum.   
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

At October 29, 2016,   $17.0   million in borrowings were outstanding, and letters of credit totaling   $26.4 million   were issued under the credit agreement leaving unutilized availability under the facility of approximately   $956.6 million  . The weighted average interest rate under the credit agreement for the borrowings outstanding at October 29, 2016 was   1.88%  . 
    
  To be in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit agreement, the Company's total leverage ratio cannot exceed   4.0   to 1.0, and the coverage ratio cannot be less than   2.5   to 1.0. At October 29, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants related to the credit agreement.  

Note 7.  Stock Repurchase Programs 
    
  The Company s Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase the Company s Class A Common Stock under open-ended stock plans.  These authorizations permit the Company to repurchase its Class A Common Stock in the open market, pursuant to preset trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or through privately negotiated transactions.  On February 25, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase   $500 million   of the Company s Class A Common Stock under an open-ended stock repurchase plan.  The authorization has no expiration date.  
    
  The following is a summary of share repurchase activity for the periods indicated (in millions, except per share data): 

All repurchases of the Company s Class A Common Stock above were made at the market price at the trade date.  Accordingly, all amounts paid to reacquire these shares were allocated to Treasury Stock.  As of   October 29, 2016  ,   $334.4 million   of authorization remained under the Company's stock repurchase plan. 

Note 8.  Income Taxes 
    
  During the three months ended October 29, 2016, income tax expense differed from what would be computed using the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes partially offset by tax benefits recognized for federal tax credits.  During the three months ended October 31, 2015, income tax expense differed from what would be computed using the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes. 
    
  During the nine months ended October 29, 2016, income tax expense differed from what would be computed using the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes partially offset by tax benefits recognized for federal tax credits.  During the nine months ended October 31, 2015, income tax expense differed from what would be computed using the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes. 

Note 9.  Reclassifications from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ( AOCL ) 
    
  Reclassifications from AOCL are summarized as follows (in thousands):  

_______________________________

Note 10.  Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
    
  Changes in AOCL by component (net of tax) are summarized as follows (in thousands):  

Note 11.  Fair Value Disclosures 
    
  The estimated fair values of financial instruments presented herein have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. 
    
  The fair value of the Company s long-term debt and subordinated debentures is based on market prices or dealer quotes. 
    
  The fair value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable approximates their carrying values at   October 29, 2016   due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.  The fair value of the Company s long-term debt at   October 29, 2016   was approximately   $692 million  .  The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt at   October 29, 2016   was   $613.2 million  .  The fair value of the Company s subordinated debentures at   October 29, 2016   was approximately   $210 million  .  The carrying value of the Company s subordinated debentures at   October 29, 2016   was   $200.0 million  . 

Note 12.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps:  (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.   
    
  This update was amended by ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which deferred the effective date for the Company from the first quarter of fiscal 2017 to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 with early adoption permitted.   
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).   This ASU clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, as it assists in the determination of whether the entity controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer.   
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.   This ASU clarifies two aspects of Topic 606, including identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the principles for those areas.  

11 

     Table of Contents  

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . This ASU clarifies three aspects of Topic 606, including the objective of the collectibility criterion, the measurement date for noncash consideration and the requirements for a completed contract. The ASU also includes a practical expedient for contract modifications. Additionally, the amendments allow an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales taxes from the transaction price.  
    
  The Company is currently assessing the impact of these updates on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)  , which requires management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures.  This ASU is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and we plan to adopt this ASU for the annual period ending on January 28, 2017. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,   to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes in the balance sheet. Under this amendment, entities will no longer be required to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the balance sheet. Rather, the amendment requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company elected to adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The prior period in our consolidated financial statements was retrospectively adjusted.  
  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , to amend Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 835.  The amendment adds the requirement for an entity to present debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset and to report amortization of the debt issuance costs as interest expense. ASU No. 2015-03 requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, using retrospective application as permitted. Prior period amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with current presentation. As a result, the Company reclassified   $1.7 million   and   $1.8 million   of debt issuance costs from other assets to reduce long-term debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheets at January 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.  
    
  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements 
    
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,   to provide authoritative guidance related to line-of-credit arrangements, which were not addressed in ASU No. 2015-03. An entity may defer and present debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as an asset. Subsequently, the debt issuance costs may be amortized as interest expense ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-15 at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , to simplify the measurement of inventory using the first-in, first out (FIFO) or average cost methods. Under this amendment, inventory under the FIFO or average cost methods should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Approximately 96% of the Company's merchandise inventories are valued using the retail inventory method, which is  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

outside the scope of this ASU. The remaining 4% of the Company's merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identified cost methods, and the Company is evaluating the effect of this update on these inventory values. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification,   to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under these amendments, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases under ASC 840. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements.  
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   to reduce the diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments within ASU No. 2016-15 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements.  
  Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,   as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. Under these amendments, an entity is required to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments within ASU No. 2016-16 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the footnotes thereto included elsewhere in this report, as well as the financial and other information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 30, 2016  . 
    
  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  The Company's third quarter performance of fiscal 2016 continued to reflect the current challenges facing department store retailers, as our sales decline continued to weigh heavily on profitability.  During the three months ended   October 29, 2016  , comparable store sales declined 4% over last year's third quarter.  Gross margin from retail operations decreased 100 basis points of net sales primarily due to increased markdowns. Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") from retail operations increased 115 basis points of net sales while SG A decreased $2.4 million. Net income decreased $22.9 million to   $22.8 million   (  $0.67   per share) for the current year third quarter from   $45.7 million   (  $1.19   per share) for the prior year third quarter.  
    
  During the three months ended October 29, 2016, the Company purchased $53.1 million of Class A Common Stock under its $500 million stock repurchase plan (including the accrual of $3.1 million of share repurchases that had not settled as of October 29, 2016). As of October 29, 2016, authorization of $334.4 million remained under the plan.  
    
  As of   October 29, 2016  , the Company had working capital of   $947.1 million  , cash and cash equivalents of   $80.5 million   and   $830.2 million   of total debt outstanding, excluding capital lease obligations.  Cash flows from operating activities were   $125.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  .   
    
  The Company currently operates 271 Dillard's locations,   23   clearance centers and one internet store.

  Seasonality  
    
  Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season.  Because of the seasonality of our business, results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.

The percent change in the Company s sales by segment and product category for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to the three months ended   October 31, 2015   as well as the sales percentage by segment and product category to total net sales for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   are as follows:  

Net sales from the retail operations segment decreased $59.2 million during the three months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to the three months ended   October 31, 2015  , decreasing 4% in both total and comparable stores. Sales of ladies' accessories and lingerie, cosmetics and shoes decreased significantly over the third quarter last year. Sales of ladies' apparel, men's apparel and accessories, juniors' and children's apparel and home and furniture decreased moderately.  
    
  The number of sales transactions decreased 6% for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to the three months ended   October 31, 2015   while the average dollars per sales transaction increased 1%.

  During the three months ended   October 29, 2016  , net sales from the construction segment decreased $9.9 million or 18.7% compared to the three months ended   October 31, 2015   due to a decrease in construction projects.  The backlog of awarded construction contracts at   October 29, 2016   totaled $278.3 million, increasing approximately 66% from January 30, 2016 and increasing approximately 27% from October 31, 2015. We expect the backlog to be earned over the next nine to twenty-four months.

  During the   nine   months ended October 29, 2016, net sales from the construction segment decreased $8.2 million or 5.3% compared to the   nine   months ended October 31, 2015 due to a decrease in construction activity.

Service charges and other income is composed primarily of income from the Wells Fargo Alliance and former Synchrony Alliance. Income from the alliances decreased during the nine months ended October 29, 2016 compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in income from the former Synchrony Alliance.

Gross Profit 

Gross profit declined   73   basis points of net sales and 106 basis points of net sales during the three and nine months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to the three and nine months ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Gross profit from retail operations declined   100   basis points of net sales during the three months ended October 29, 2016 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2015 primarily due to higher markdowns. Gross margin declined moderately in men's apparel and accessories and home and furniture. Gross margin declined slightly in ladies' accessories and lingerie. Gross margin remained essentially flat in ladies' apparel, shoes, cosmetics and juniors' and children's apparel.  
    
  Gross profit from retail operations declined   113   basis points of net sales during the nine months ended October 29, 2016 compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2015 primarily due to higher markdowns. Gross margin declined moderately in ladies' accessories and lingerie, men s apparel and accessories and home and furniture.

  Gross profit from the construction segment increased 214 basis points and 90 basis points of construction sales for the three and nine months ended October 29, 2016, respectively.  
    
  Inventory decreased 2% in total and 1% in comparable stores as of   October 29, 2016   compared to   October 31, 2015  .  A 1% change in the dollar amount of markdowns would have impacted net income by approximately $2 million and $7 million for the three and   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ( SG A ) 

SG A increased   129   basis points of net sales during the three months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to the three months ended   October 31, 2015   while total SG A decreased $2.2 million.  SG A from retail operations increased   115   basis points of net sales during the three months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to the three months ended   October 31, 2015   while total SG A from retail operations decreased by $2.4 million.  This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $4.6 million in several expense categories, primarily advertising expense ($1.6 million) and services purchased ($1.3 million), which were partially offset by increases in payroll expense ($2.3 million) and insurance expense ($0.8 million).  
    
  SG A increased   87   basis points of net sales during the nine months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to the nine months ended   October 31, 2015   while total SG A decreased $16.5 million.

This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in advertising expense ($6.3 million), services purchased ($5.8 million), supplies ($5.4 million) and utilities expense ($3.6 million) partially offset by an increase in insurance expense ($4.3 million).

Depreciation and Amortization 

Depreciation and amortization expense for the three and   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to the three and   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015   decreased $4.9 million and $5.3 million, respectively, due to the timing and composition of capital expenditures. 
    
     Interest and Debt Expense, Net 

The increase in net interest and debt expense for the three and nine months ended October 29, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in capitalized interest. Total weighted average debt decreased by $17.6 million during the three months ended October 29, 2016 and increased $9.4 million for the nine months ended October 29, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company s estimated federal and state effective income tax rate, inclusive of income on and equity in earnings of joint ventures, was approximately 35.0% and 35.3% for the three months ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.  During the three months ended October 29, 2016, income tax expense differed from what would be computed using the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes partially offset by tax benefits recognized for federal tax credits.  During the three months ended October 31, 2015, income tax expense differed from what would be computed using the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes. 
    
  The Company s estimated federal and state effective income tax rate, inclusive of income on and equity in earnings of joint ventures, was approximately 35.2% and 34.7% for the nine months ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.  During the nine months ended October 29, 2016, income tax expense differed from what would be computed using the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes partially offset by tax benefits recognized for federal tax credits.  During the nine months ended October 31, 2015, income tax expense differed from what would be computed using the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes.

The Company expects the fiscal 2016 federal and state effective income tax rate to approximate 35%.  This rate may change if results of operations for fiscal 2016 differ from management s current expectations.  Changes in the Company s assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  A summary of net cash flows for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   follows:  

Net cash flows from operations increased $42.6 million during the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015  .  This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $112.2 million related to changes in working capital items, primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as changes in merchandise inventories, income taxes and other current assets. This increase in cash flow from operations was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit.  
    
  Synchrony Financial ("Synchrony") previously owned and managed Dillard s private label credit cards under the Synchrony Alliance that expired in November 2014.  Following that scheduled expiration, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ("Wells Fargo") purchased the Dillard's private label card portfolio from Synchrony and began managing Dillard's private label cards under the Wells Fargo Alliance.  Under the Wells Fargo Alliance, Wells Fargo establishes and owns private label card accounts for our customers, retains the benefits and risks associated with the ownership of the accounts, provides key customer service functions, including new account openings, transaction authorization, billing adjustments and customer inquiries, receives the finance charge income and incurs the bad debts associated with those accounts.   
    
  Pursuant to the Wells Fargo Alliance, we receive on-going cash compensation from Wells Fargo based upon the portfolio's earnings.  The compensation earned on the portfolio is determined monthly and has no recourse provisions.  The amount the Company recognizes is dependent on the level of sales on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of balances carried on Wells Fargo accounts by Wells Fargo customers, payment rates on Wells Fargo accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of credit losses for the Wells Fargo accounts, Wells Fargo's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs.  We participate in the marketing of the private label cards, which includes the cost of customer reward programs. We accept payments on the private label cards in our stores as a convenience to customers who prefer to pay in person rather than by paying online or mailing their payments to Wells Fargo.  The Wells Fargo Alliance expires in fiscal 2024. 
    
  The Company received income of approximately   $75.6 million   and   $78.2 million   from the Wells Fargo Alliance and former Synchrony Alliance during the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.   
    
  Capital expenditures were   $73.4 million   and   $141.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  The decline in capital expenditures was primarily related to the construction of new stores during the comparable prior year period. Capital expenditures for fiscal   2016   are expected to be approximately $100 million compared to actual expenditures of $166 million during fiscal 2015.  
    
  Changes in restricted cash balances are reflected as an investment activity in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. During the nine months ended October 31, 2015, payments of $7.3 million were made from restricted cash for like-kind property.  
    
  We opened a replacement store in Four Seasons Town Centre in Greensboro, North Carolina (210,000 square feet) in October 2016. We closed the Aiken store in Aiken, South Carolina (105,000 square feet) in May 2016, the South Towne clearance center in Sandy, Utah (100,000 square feet) in July 2016 and the Six Flags clearance center in Arlington, Texas (85,000 square feet) in August 2016. We remain committed to closing under-performing stores where appropriate and may incur future closing costs related to these stores when they close.

During the three months ended October 29, 2016, we temporarily closed our full-line store in Chesterfield, Missouri due to water damage. Property and merchandise losses are covered by insurance, and no material loss to the financial statements is expected. We plan to reopen the store in fiscal 2017. 
    
  During the three months ended October 29, 2016, the Company invested $20.0 million in an existing open air center joint venture located in Bonita Springs, Florida. The investment was funded using cash on hand. The joint venture used these funds in the refinancing of its debt. 
    
  The Company had cash on hand of   $80.5 million   as of   October 29, 2016  .  As part of our overall liquidity management strategy and for peak working capital requirements, the Company maintains a $1.0 billion unsecured credit facility.  The credit facility is available for working capital needs and general corporate purposes. The rate of interest on borrowings is LIBOR plus 1.375%, and the commitment fee for unused borrowings is 0.20% per annum. To be in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit agreement, the Company's total leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.0 to 1.0, and the Company's coverage ratio cannot be less than 2.5 to 1.0. At October 29, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants related to the credit agreement. 
    
  At October 29, 2016, $17.0 million in borrowings were outstanding, and letters of credit totaling   $26.4 million   were issued under the credit agreement leaving unutilized availability under the facility of approximately   $956.6 million  . The weighted average interest rate under the credit agreement for the borrowings outstanding at October 29, 2016 was 1.88%.   
    
  During the nine months ended October 29, 2016, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares of Class A Common Stock at an average price of $67.13 per share for $165.6 million (including the accrual of $3.1 million of share repurchases that had not settled as of October 29, 2016). During the nine months ended October 31, 2015, the Company repurchased 3.7 million shares of its Common Stock at an average price of $102.52 for $382.5 million.  At   October 29, 2016  , $334.4 million of authorization remained under the Company's stock repurchase plan.  The ultimate disposition of the repurchased stock has not been determined.  
    
  During fiscal 2016, the Company expects to finance its capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases from cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations and utilization of the credit facility.  Depending on conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Company may from time to time consider other possible financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special-purpose entities or off-balance-sheet arrangements for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating the Company s business.

           2.             
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
  (a)                       Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
    
  (b)                       Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
    
  (c)                        Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

           5.             
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
  (a)                       All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
    
  (b)                       Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
