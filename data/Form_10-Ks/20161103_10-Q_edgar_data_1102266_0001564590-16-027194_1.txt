     NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 
 (in thousands of dollars, except per share data) 

NOTE 1: Nature of operations and basis of presentation  
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenterState Banks, Inc. (the  Parent Company,   Company  or  CSFL ), and its wholly owned subsidiary bank, CenterState Bank of Florida, N.A. ( CenterState ), and non bank subsidiaries, R4ALL, Inc. and CSFL Insurance Corp. The subsidiary bank operates through 66 full service banking locations in 22 counties throughout Florida, providing traditional deposit and lending products and services to its commercial and retail customers.  R4ALL, Inc. is a separate non bank subsidiary of CSFL. Its purpose is to purchase troubled loans from the subsidiary bank and manage their eventual disposition.  CSFL Insurance Corp. is a non bank subsidiary of CSFL and its primary purpose is to function as a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code.  
 In addition, the Company also operates a correspondent banking and capital markets division. The division is integrated with and part of the subsidiary bank located in Winter Haven, Florida, although the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are physically housed in leased facilities located in Birmingham, Alabama, Atlanta, Georgia, Winston Salem, North Carolina and San Francisco, California. The business lines of this division are primarily divided into three inter-related revenue generating activities. The first, and largest, revenue generator is commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. The second category includes correspondent bank deposits (i.e. federal funds purchased) and correspondent bank checking account deposits. The third revenue generating category includes fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services for correspondents, asset/liability consulting related activities, international wires, and other clearing and corporate checking account services. The customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions primarily located in the Southeastern United States.  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the Company s opinion, all adjustments, consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods have been made. The results of operations of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year.  
 Some items in the prior period financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Reclassifications had no effect on prior period net income or shareholders  equity.

  NOTE 2: Common stock outstanding and earnings per share data   
 The two-class method is used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share.  Under the two-class method, earnings available to common shareholders for the period are allocated between common shareholders and participating securities according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings.  There  were an average of 24,500, 462,004, 67,609 and 473,501 stock options that were not considered in computing diluted earnings per common share because  they were anti-dilutive during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The following table presents the factors used in the earnings per share computations for the periods indicated.  

1.   
 
 Participating securities are restricted stock awards whereby the stock certificates have been issued, are included in outstanding shares, receive dividends and can be voted, but have not vested.         

NOTE 3: Fair value  
 Generally accepted accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  
 Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.  
 Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  
 Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing and asset or liability.  
 The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs) or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs).  
 The fair values of trading securities are determined as follows: (1) for those securities that have traded prior to the date of the consolidated balance sheet but have not settled (date of sale) until after such date, the sales price is used as the fair value (Level 1); and, (2) for those securities which have not traded as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, the fair value was determined by broker price indications of similar or same securities (Level 2).

The fair value of impaired loans with specific valuation allowance for loan losses and other real estate owned is based on recent real estate appraisals. For residential real estate impaired loans and other real estate owned, appraised values are based on the comparative sales approach. For commercial and commercial real estate impaired loans, and other real estate owned, appraisers may use either a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches such as comparative sales, cost or the income approach. A significant unobservable input in the income approach is the estimated income capitalization rate for a given piece of collateral. At September 30, 2016, the range of capitalization rates utilized to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral ranged from 7% to 10%. Adjustments to appraisals may be made by the appraiser to reflect local market conditions or other economic factors and may result in changes in the fair value of a given asset over time. As such, the fair value of impaired loans and other real estate owned are considered a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  
 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below.  

Impaired loans measured at fair value had a recorded investment of  $13,034  with a valuation allowance of  $399 , at September 30, 2016, and a recorded investment of $13,293, with a valuation allowance of $807, at December 31, 2015. The Company recorded a provision for loan loss  expense of $86 and $458 on these  loans during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016.   The     Company     recorded     a   provision     for     loan     loss     expense of     $241 and $516 on     impaired loans carried at fair value     during     the   three   and nine   month     periods     ending     September 30, 2015.   
 Other real estate owned had a decline in fair  value of $237, $237, $651 and $1,016 during  the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Changes in fair value were recorded directly to current earnings through non interest expense.

  Bank property held for sale represents certain branch office buildings which the Company has closed and consolidated with other existing branche  s. The real estate was transferred out of the Bank Premises and Equipment category into bank property held for sale     at the lower of amortized cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. The fair values were based upon   appraisals  .      T  he Company   recognized an impairm  ent charge     of   $549  ,     $12  ,   $967     and   $637     during the three   and   nine     month periods ending   September   30  , 2016 and 2015  , respectively  ,   related to bank properties   held for   sale  .       
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair value are described as follows:  
  Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1.  
  FHLB and FRB Stock : It is not practical to determine the fair value of FHLB and FRB stock due to restrictions placed on their transferability.  
  Investment securities held to maturity :  The fair values of securities held to maturity are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1 inputs) or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). 
  Loans held for sale : The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts from third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
  Loans, net : Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are estimated as follows: For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. Impaired loans are valued as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.  
  FDIC Indemnification Asset : It is not practical to determine the fair value of the FDIC indemnification asset due to restrictions placed on its transferability.  
  Accrued Interest Receivable : The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates fair value and is classified as Level 2 for accrued interest receivable related to investment securities and Level 3 for accrued interest receivable related to loans.  
  Deposits : The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, savings, and money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in Level 1 classification. Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
  Short-term Borrowings : The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings, generally maturing within ninety days, approximate their fair values resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
  Corporate Debentures : The fair values of the Company s corporate debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.  
  Accrued Interest Payable : The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates fair value resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
   Off-balance Sheet Instruments : The fair value of off-balance-sheet items is not considered material.

Commercial and retail banking : The Company s primary business is commercial and retail banking. Currently, the Company operates through its subsidiary bank and two non bank subsidiaries, R4ALL and CSFL Insurance Corp., with 66 full service banking locations in 22 counties throughout Florida providing traditional deposit and lending products and services to its commercial and retail customers.  
  Correspondent banking and capital markets division : Operating as a division of our subsidiary bank, its primary revenue generating activities are related to the capital markets division which includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities. Income generated related to the correspondent banking services includes spread income earned on correspondent bank deposits (i.e. federal funds purchased) and fees generated from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services, asset/liability consulting services, international wires, clearing and corporate checking account services and other correspondent banking related services. The fees derived from the correspondent banking services are less volatile than those generated through the capital markets group. The customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions primarily located in Southeastern United States.  
  Corporate overhead and administration : Corporate overhead and administration is comprised primarily of compensation and benefits for certain members of management, interest on parent company debt, office occupancy and depreciation of parent company facilities, certain merger related costs and other expenses.

  NOTE 5: Investment   s  ecurities  
   
  Available-for-Sale   
 All of the mortgage backed securities listed below were issued by U.S. government sponsored entities and agencies, primarily Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. The fair value of available for sale securities and the related gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:  

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. The securities sold during the first quarter of 2016 were securities acquired through the acquisitions of Community Bank of South Florida, Inc. ( Community ) and Hometown of Homestead Banking Company ( Hometown ) on March 1, 2016. These acquired securities were marked to fair value and subsequently sold after the acquisition date, and no gain or loss was recognized from the sale of these securities. Sales of available for sale securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

The tax provision related to these net realized gains was $5 and $2, respectively.  
 The fair value of available for sale securities at September 30, 2016 by contractual maturity were as follows. Securities not due at a single maturity date, primarily mortgage-backed securities, are shown separately.  

Available for sale securities pledged at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 had a carrying amount (estimated fair value) of $235,957 and $195,753 respectively. These securities were pledged primarily to secure public deposits and repurchase agreements.

  At      September   30  , 2016   and December 31, 201  5  , there were   no   holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than mortgage backed secur  ities issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies, in an amount greater than   10  % of stockholders  equity.     
 The following tables show the Company s available for sale investments  gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

At  September 30, 2016, 100% of the mortgage-backed securities held by the Company were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the Company does not have the intent to sell these mortgage-backed securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at  September 30, 2016.  
   
  Held-to-Maturity   
 The following reflects the fair value of held-to-maturity securities and the related gross unrecognized gains and losses as of  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Held-to-maturity securities pledged at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 had a carrying amount of $44,436 and $48,246 respectively. These securities were pledged primarily to secure public deposits and repurchase agreements.

   At   September   30  , 2016  , there were no holdings of held  -to-  maturity securities of any one     issuer in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders  equity.   
   The fair value and amortized cost of held to maturity securities at September 30, 2016 by contractual maturity were as follows. Mortgage-backed securities are not due at a single maturity date and are shown separately.  

The following table shows the Company s held to maturity investments  gross unrecognized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time the individual securities have been in a continuous unrecognized loss position, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

At September 30, 2016, 100% of the mortgage-backed securities held by the Company were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the Company does not have the intent to sell these mortgage-backed securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.  
 Unrealized losses on municipal securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers bonds are of high quality, and because management does not intend to sell these investments or more likely than not will not be required to sell these investments before their anticipated recovery. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity.

The following tables present the balance in the allowance for loan losses and the recorded investment in loans by portfolio segment and based on impairment method as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Accrued interest receivable and unearned loan fees and costs are not included in the recorded investment because they are not material.  

Loans collectively evaluated for impairment reported at September 30, 2016 include loans acquired from First Southern Bank ( FSB ) on June 1, 2014 and from Gulfstream Business Bank ( GSB ) on January 17, 2014 that are not PCI loans.  These loans were performing loans recorded at estimated fair value at the acquisition date. The aggregate fair value adjustment for these loans at their respective acquisition dates was  approximately $17,761, or approximately 2.10% of the aggregate acquisition date balances.  The amount is accreted into interest income over the remaining lives of the related loans on a level yield basis.  The aggregate unamortized acquisition date fair value adjustment was approximately $7,207 and $9,354, which represents approximately 1.40% and 1.59% of the remaining outstanding balance of these acquired loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Management has also estimated probable incurred losses based on performance since the respective acquisition dates, and based on these estimates, has included $2,323 in the Company s general loan allowance with respect to these acquired loans.     
   
 Loans collectively evaluated for impairment reported at September 30, 2016 also include loans acquired from Community and Hometown on March 1, 2016.  The acquired loans were recorded at estimated fair value at acquisition; therefore, no allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans at September 30, 2016.

  The table below summarizes impaired loan data for the perio  ds presented.   

In certain situations it has become more common to restructure or modify the terms of certain loans under certain conditions (i.e. troubled debt restructure or  TDRs ). In those circumstances it may be beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties, versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in a distressed sale. When the terms of a loan have been modified, usually the monthly payment and/or interest rate is reduced for generally twelve to twenty-four months. Material principal amounts on any loan modifications have not been forgiven to date.  
 TDRs as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 quantified by loan type classified separately as accrual (performing loans) and non-accrual (non performing loans) are presented in the tables below.  

Our policy is to return non accrual TDR loans to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due, pursuant to its modified terms, are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Our policy also considers the payment history of the borrower, but is not dependent upon a specific number of payments. The Company recorded a provision for loan loss  expense of $87 and $447 and partial charge offs of $51 and $169 on the TDR loans described above during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016.  The Company recorded a provision  for loan loss expense of $70 and $321 and partial charge-offs of $50 and $224 on TDR loans during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2015.  
 Loans are modified to minimize loan losses when we believe the modification will improve the borrower s financial condition and ability to repay the loan. We typically do not forgive principal. We generally either reduce interest rates or decrease monthly payments for a temporary period of time and those reductions of cash flows are capitalized into the loan balance. We may also extend maturities, convert balloon loans to longer term amortizing loans, or vice versa, or change interest rates between variable and fixed rate . Each borrower and situation is unique and we try to accommodate the borrower and minimize the Company s potential losses. Approximately 77% of our TDRs are current pursuant to their modified terms, and $3,064, or approximately 23% of  our total TDRs are not performing pursuant to their modified terms. There does not appear to be any significant difference in success rates with one type of concession versus another.  
 Loans modified as TDRs during the three and nine month periods ending September 30,  2016 were $400 and $2,395.  The  Company recorded a loan loss  provision of $48 and $201 for loans modified  during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016.   Loans modified as TDRs during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2015 were $225 and $3,225.  The Company recorded a loan loss provision of $3 and $194 for loans modified during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2015.

  Credit Quality Indicators:   
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on at least an annual basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:  
 Special Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date.  
 Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  
 Doubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.  
 Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans.  The following table presents the risk category of loans by class of loans based on the most recent analysis performed, excluding purchased credit impaired loans accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 310-30, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The increase in loans categorized as special mention between the periods presented is due to the acquisitions of Community and Hometown on March 1, 2016.  

The Company considers the performance of the loan portfolio and its impact on the allowance for loan losses. For residential and consumer loan classes, the Company also evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan, which was previously presented, and by payment activity. The following table presents the recorded investment in residential and consumer loans, excluding purchased credit impaired loans, based on payment activity as of  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

  Purchased Credit Impaired ( PCI ) loans:   
 Income is recognized on PCI loans pursuant to ASC Topic 310-30. A portion of the fair value discount has been ascribed as an accretable yield that is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The remaining non-accretable difference represents cash flows not expected to be collected.  
 The table below summarizes the total contractually required principal and interest cash payments, management s estimate of expected total cash payments and carrying value of the loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Contractually required principal and interest payments have been adjusted for estimated prepayments.  

We adjusted our estimates of future expected losses, cash flows and renewal assumptions during the current quarter. These adjustments resulted in an increase in expected cash flows and accretable yield, and a decrease in the non-accretable difference. We  reclassified approximately $1,130, $6,722, $4,731 and $19,147 from non-accretable  difference to accretable yield during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 to reflect our adjusted estimates of future expected cash flows. The table below summarizes the changes in total contractually required principal and interest cash payments, management s estimate of expected total cash payments and carrying value of the loans during the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015.

  NOTE 7: FDIC indemnification asset   
 The FDIC indemnification asset represented the estimated amounts due from the FDIC pursuant to the Loss Share Agreements related to the acquisition of the three failed banks in 2010, the acquisition of two failed banks in 2012 and the Loss Share Agreements of two failed banks assumed by the Company pursuant to its acquisition of FSB in June 2014.  On February 3, 2016, the FDIC bought out the remaining FDIC loss share agreements.  As such, the FDIC indemnification asset was written-off effectively accelerating all future FDIC indemnification asset amortization expense as well as ending any future FDIC indemnification income.  The activity in the FDIC loss share indemnification asset was as follows:  

The FDIC agreements allowed for the recovery of some payments made for loss share reimbursements under certain conditions based on the actual performance of the portfolios acquired. This true-up payment was estimated and accrued for as part of the overall FDIC indemnification asset analysis and was reflected as a separate liability. The accrual for this liability was reflected as additional amortization income or expense in noninterest income.  On February 3, 2016, the FDIC clawback liability was written-off as a result of the termination of FDIC loss share agreements as discussed above.  The activity in the true-up payment liability was as follows:

  NOTE 9: Business Combinations  
  Acquisition of Community Bank of South Florida, Inc.   
 On March 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Community Bank of South Florida, Inc. ( Community ) whereby Community merged with and into the Company. Pursuant to and simultaneously with the merger of Community with and into the Company, Community s wholly owned subsidiary bank, Community Bank of Florida, Inc. merged with and into the Company s subsidiary bank, CenterState Bank of Florida, N.A.  
 The Company s primary reasons for the transaction were to further solidify its market share in the Central and South Florida markets and expand its customer base to enhance deposit fee income and leverage operating cost through economies of scale. The acquisition increased the Company s total assets and total deposits by approximately 12% and 14%, respectively, as compared with the balances at December 31, 2015, and is expected to positively affect the Company s operating results to the extent the Company earns more from interest earning assets than it pays in interest on its interest bearing liabilities.  
 The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations . The Company recognized goodwill on this acquisition of $25,464 which is nondeductible for tax purposes as this acquisition is a nontaxable transaction. The goodwill is calculated based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Fair value estimates are based on the information available, and are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes available.  Fair values are preliminary estimates due to pending appraisals on loans and other real estate owned.  
 The Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Community. The purchase price consisted of both cash and stock. Each share of Community common stock was either exchanged for $13.31 cash or 0.9148 shares of the Company s common stock. Based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on February 29, 2016, the resulting purchase price was $64,986.  The table below summarizes the purchase price calculation.

The list below summarizes the estimates of the fair value of the assets purchased, including goodwill, and liabilities assumed as of the March 1, 2016 purchase date.  

In the acquisition, the Company acquired $316,444 of loans at fair value, net of $20,439, or 6.1%, estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance, representing 12.2% of the Company s total loans at December 31, 2015. Of the total loans acquired, management identified $43,298 with credit deficiencies. All loans that were on non-accrual status, impaired loans including TDRs and other substandard loans were considered by management to be credit impaired and are accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 310-30.  The table below summarizes the total contractually required principal and interest cash payments, management s estimate of expected total cash payments and fair value of the loans as of March 1, 2016 for purchased credit impaired loans. Contractually required principal and interest payments have been adjusted for estimated prepayments.  

The table below presents information with respect to the fair value of acquired loans, as well as their unpaid principal balance ( Book Balance ) at acquisition date.  

In its assumption of the deposit liabilities, the Company believed the deposits assumed from the acquisition have an intangible value. The Company applied ASC Topic 805, which prescribes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles, in a business combination. The Company determined the estimated fair value of the core deposit intangible asset totaled $3,684,   which will be amortized utilizing an accelerated amortization method over an estimated economic life not to exceed ten years. In determining the valuation amount, deposits were analyzed based on factors such as type of deposit, deposit retention, interest rates and age of deposit relationships.

  NOTE 10:  Derivatives   
 The Company enters into interest rate swaps in order to provide commercial loan clients the ability to swap from fixed to variable interest rates.  Under these agreements, the Company enters into a fixed-rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement.  This swap agreement effectively converts the client s fixed rate loan into a variable rate.  The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third party dealer in order to offset its exposure on the customer swap.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the notional amount of such arrangements was $2,006,466   and $939,831, respectively, and investment securities with a fair value of $85,785   and $31,801 were pledged as collateral to the third party dealers.  As the interest rate swaps with the clients and third parties are not designated as hedges under ASC 815, changes in market values are reported in earnings.

 NOTE 12:  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (the "IASB") jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). Previous revenue recognition guidance in GAAP consisted of broad revenue recognition concepts together with numerous revenue requirements for particular industries or transactions, which sometimes resulted in different accounting for economically similar transactions. In contrast, IFRS provided limited revenue recognition guidance and, consequently, could be difficult to apply to complex transactions. Accordingly, the FASB and the IASB initiated a joint project to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS that would: (1) remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; (2) provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; (3) improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; (4) provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements; and (5) simplify the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. To meet those objectives, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,"Revenue from Contracts with Customers." The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies generally will be required to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The standard was initially effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; early adoption was not permitted. However, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date" which deferred the effective date by one year (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017). For financial reporting purposes, the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with the cumulative effect of initially applying

 CenterState Banks, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 
 (in thousands of dollars, except per share data) 
   
  the standard recognized at the date of initial application. In addition, the FASB has begun to issue targeted updates to clarify specific implementation   issues of ASU 2014-09. These updates include ASU No. 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),  ASU No. 2016-10,  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  and ASU No. 2016-12  Narrow-Scope Improvements   and Practical Expedients.  The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09 and its related updates and will be closely monitoring developments and additional guidance to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on th  e Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." This ASU addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments by making targeted improvements to GAAP as follows: (1) require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer; (2) simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value; (3) eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities; (4) eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (5) require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (6) require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (7) require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (8) clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption only for provisions (3) and (6) above. Early adoption of the other provisions mentioned above is not permitted. The Company has performed a preliminary evaluation of the provisions of ASU No. 2016-01. Based on this evaluation, the Company has determined that ASU No. 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements; however, the Company will continue to closely monitor developments and additional guidance. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases." Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases): 1) a lease liability, which is the present value of a lessee's obligation to make lease payments, and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessor accounting under the new guidance remains largely unchanged as it is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases, and operating leases. Leveraged leases have been eliminated, although lessors can continue to account for existing leveraged leases using the current accounting guidance. Other limited changes were made to align lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and the new revenue recognition standard. All entities will classify leases to determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures will be required by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The intention is to require enough information to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. All entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. They have the option to use certain relief; full retrospective application is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 and will be closely monitoring developments and additional guidance to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. Some of the key provisions of this new ASU include: (1) companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in capital ( APIC ). Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, and APIC pools will be eliminated. The guidance also eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them. In addition, the guidance requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity; (2) increase the

  amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding oblig  ation. The new guidance will also require an employer to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on its statement of cash flows (current guidance   did not specify how these cash flows should be classified); and (3) permit companies to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated, as required   today, or recognized when they occur. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currentl  y evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income. In issuing the standard, the FASB is responding to criticism that today s guidance delays recognition of credit losses. The standard will replace today s  incurred loss  approach with an  expected loss  model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale ( AFS ) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. The ASU also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach). The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 2:   
 
        MANAGE  MENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      

 (All dollar amounts presented herein are in thousands, except per share data, or unless otherwise noted.)  
 COMPARISON OF BALANCE SHEETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015  
 Overview  
 Our total assets increased approximately  25%  from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, which was primarily the result of the two bank acquisitions on March 1, 2016.  In addition to the growth through acquisitions, organic deposit growth increased $134,844   or    6%    annualized primarily in commercial checking.  The growth in liquidity from the liability increases was used primarily to support the 14% annualized loan growth (excluding PCI loans and acquisition day balances from the two Homestead, Florida acquisitions as described below) during the period.  Our loan to deposit ratio was 81.2%   and 80.7% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
   
 On March 1, 2016, we closed our previously announced acquisitions of Community Bank of South Florida, Inc. ( Community ) and Hometown of Homestead Banking Company ( Hometown ) , whereby we acquired approximately $837,090 of assets including $514,231 of loans and an additional $705,912 of deposits.  Furthermore, we acquired 17 branch locations of which 15 are located in Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties and two are located in Polk County.  The two branches in Polk County were closed in March 2016 and nine additional branches were closed in May 2016.  
   
 In February 2016, we terminated all existing loss share agreements with the FDIC.  As a result, the Company wrote off the remaining indemnification asset and the claw back liability, received cash from the FDIC and recognized a pretax loss on the transaction of approximately $17,560 during the first quarter.   
   
 These changes are discussed and analyzed below and on the following pages.  
 Federal funds sold and Federal Reserve Bank deposits  
 Federal funds sold and Federal Reserve Bank deposits were $161,406   at September 30, 2016 (approximately 3% of total assets) as compared to $101,580 at December 31, 2015 (approximately 3% of total assets). We use our available-for-sale securities portfolio, as well as federal funds sold and Federal Reserve Bank deposits for liquidity management and for investment yields. These accounts, as a group, will fluctuate as a function of loans outstanding, and to some degree the amount of correspondent bank deposits (i.e. federal funds purchased) outstanding.  
 Investment securities available for sale  
 Securities available-for-sale, consisting primarily of U.S. government sponsored enterprises and municipal tax exempt securities, were $761,648   at September 30, 2016 (approximately 15% of total assets) compared to $604,739 at December 31, 2015 (approximately 15% of total assets), an  increase of $156,909 or 26%.    We use our available-for-sale securities portfolio, as well as federal funds sold and Federal Reserve Bank deposits for liquidity management and for investment yields. These accounts, as a group, will fluctuate as a function of loans outstanding as discussed above, under the caption  Federal funds sold and Federal Reserve Bank deposits.  We classify the majority of our securities as  available for sale  to provide for greater flexibility to respond to changes in interest rates as well as future liquidity needs.  Our available for sale securities are carried at fair value. 
 Trading securities  
 We also have a trading securities portfolio. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of our non interest income, in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been various municipal securities. A list of the activity in this portfolio is summarized below.  

40 

Investment securities held to maturity  
   
 At September 30, 2016, we had $263,692   (unamortized cost basis) of securities with an estimated fair value of $269,721, resulting in a net unrecognized gain of  $6,029 , compared to $272,840 (unamortized cost basis) of securities with an estimated fair value of $273,983 and a net unrecognized gain of $1,143 at December 31, 2015.  This portfolio generally holds longer term securities for the primary purpose of yield.  This classification was chosen to minimize temporary effects on our tangible equity and tangible equity ratio due to increases and decreases in general market interest rates. 
   
 Loans held for sale  
 We also have a loans held for sale portfolio, whereby we originate single family home loans and sell those mortgages into the secondary market, servicing released. These loans are recorded at the lower of cost or market. Gains and losses on the sale of loans held for sale are included as a component of non-interest income in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. A list of the activity in this portfolio is summarized below.  

Loans  
 Lending-related income is the most important component of our net interest income and is a major contributor to profitability. The loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets, and it therefore generates the largest portion of revenues. The absolute volume of loans and the volume of loans as a percentage of earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin as loans are expected to produce higher yields than securities and other earning assets. Average loans during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016,  were $3,068,715 or 71.8% of average earning assets , as compared to $2,495,935, or 72.6% of average earning assets, for the nine month period ending September 30, 2015. Total loans at September 30,  2016 and December 31, 2015 were $3,294,482 and $2,593,776, respectively. This represents a loan to total asset ratio of 65.7% and 64.5% and a loan to deposit ratio of 81.2% and 80.7% , at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
   
 Non-PCI loans  
 At September 30, 2016, we have total Non- PCI loans of $3,097,194.  Total new loans  originated during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 approximated $735.8 million, of which $625.0 million were funded at the time of origination. The weighted average interest rate on funded loans was approximately 3.72% during the nine month period.  The graph below summarizes new loan originations and funded loan production over the past nine quarters.  The loan origination pipeline is approximately $378 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $365 million at June 30, 2016.   

41 

PCI loans   
   
 Total Purchased Credit Impaired ( PCI ) loans at September 30, 2016  were $197,288 compared  to $210,528 at December 31, 2015.  We acquired $45,125 of PCI loans at fair value, net of $13,010 estimated discount, with the acquisitions of Community and Hometown.    
 Loan concentrations are considered to exist where there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities, which collectively could be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and when the total of such amounts would exceed 25% of total capital. Due to the lack of diversified industry and the relative proximity of markets served, the Company has concentrations in geographic as well as in types of loans funded.  
 Total loans  at September 30, 2016 were $3,294,482. Of this amount, approximately 85.0% are collateralized by real estate, 12.4% are commercial non real estate loans and the remaining 2.6% are consumer and other non real estate loans. We have approximately $881,314 of single family residential loans which represents about 27% of our total loan portfolio. Our largest category of loans is commercial real estate which represents approximately 54.3% of our total loan portfolio.   
   
 The following table sets forth information concerning the loan portfolio by collateral types as of the dates indicated.  

42 

The table below summarizes the Company s loan mix for the periods presented. 

(1)   
 
 Acquired loans include the non-PCI loans purchased pursuant to the following acquisitions:    

Branch and loan transaction from TD Bank (year 2011);     

Gulfstream Business Bank acquisition (year 2014);     

Community Bank of South Florida acquisition (year 2016); and     

Hometown of Homestead Banking Company acquisition (year 2016).     

 Credit quality and allowance for loan losses  
 We maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable losses incurred in our loan portfolio.  The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is a charge to current period earnings and decreased by loan charge-offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge-offs.  Loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely.    
 The allowance consists of three components. The first component is an allocation for impaired loans, as defined by ASC 310.  Impaired loans are those loans whereby management has arrived at a determination that the Company will not be repaid according to the original terms of the loan agreement. Each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific allowance allocated to the particular loan, if any. That is to say, a loan may be impaired (i.e., not expected to be repaid as agreed), but  
   
 43 

may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principal and interest eventually, and therefore no specific allowance is warranted.   
 Commercial, commercial real estate, land, land development and construction loans in excess of $500 are monitored and evaluated for impairment on an individual loan basis. Commercial, commercial real estate, land, land development and construction loans less than $500 are evaluated for impairment on a pool basis. All consumer and single family residential loans are evaluated for impairment on a pool basis.  
 On at least a quarterly basis, management reviews each impaired loan to determine whether it should have a specific reserve or partial charge-off. Management relies on appraisals to help make this determination. Updated appraisals are obtained for collateral dependent loans when a loan is scheduled for renewal or refinance. In addition, if the classification of the loan is downgraded to substandard, identified as impaired, or placed on nonaccrual status (collectively  Problem Loans ), an updated appraisal is obtained if the loan amount is greater than $500 and individually evaluated for impairment.  
 After an updated appraisal is obtained for a Problem Loan, as described above, an additional updated appraisal will be obtained on at least an annual basis. Thus, current appraisals for Problem Loans in excess of $500 will not be older than one year.  
 After the initial updated appraisal is obtained for a Problem Loan and before its next annual appraisal update is due, management considers the need for a downward adjustment to the current appraisal amount to reflect current market conditions, based on management s analysis, judgment and experience. In an extremely volatile market, we may update the appraisal prior to the one year anniversary date.  
 The second component is a general allowance on all of the Company s loans other than PCI loans and those identified as impaired. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company over the most recent two years. The portfolio segments identified by the Company are residential loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and land development loans, commercial and industrial and consumer and other. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic, or qualitative, factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; levels and trends in special mention and substandard loans; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.  
 The third component consists of amounts reserved for purchased credit impaired loans. On a quarterly basis, the Company updates the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected, incorporating assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows discounted at the pool s effective interest rate. Impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected principal cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses; any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income. The impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income. Disposals of loans, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payments in full by the borrower, or foreclosure, result in removal of the loan from the PCI portfolio. The aggregate of these three components results in our total allowance for loan losses.  

44 

In the table below we have shown the components, as discussed above, of our allowance for loan losses at   September   30  , 2016   and December 31, 201  5  .   

(1)   
 
 These are loans that were acquired as performing loans that subsequently became impaired.    

(2)   
 
 These are performing acquired loans that were recorded at estimated fair value on the related acquisition dates.  The total net unamortized fair value adjustment at September 30, 2016 was approximately $16,787 or 1.6% of the aggregate outstanding related loan balances.  Prior to March 31, 2016, the Company did not previously include loans acquired pursuant to the TD Bank and Federal Trust acquisitions that occurred in 2011.  Acquired loans currently include performing loans acquired from the TD Bank acquisition (year 2011), the Federal Trust acquisition (year 2011), the Gulfstream Bank acquisition (year 2014), the First Southern Bank acquisition (year 2014), the Community Bank acquisition (year 2016) and the Hometown of Homestead Banking Company acquisition (year 2016).  All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this new presentation format.          

The general loan loss allowance (non-impaired loans) relating to originated  loans increased by $4,100 resulting primarily from an increase in loans outstanding.  Net changes resulting from a mixture of decreases and increases in the Company s  various two year historical loss factors and qualitative factors also slightly affected the net change.    
   
 The general loan loss allowance (non-impaired loans) relating to acquired  loans decreased by $625  resulting primarily from a decrease in loans outstanding, excluding the two bank acquisitions (Community Bank and Hometown of Homestead Banking Company) which occurred during the first quarter of 2016.  At September 30, 2016 the non-impaired loans acquired from these two acquisitions were equal to approximately $421,590.  These loans were recorded at estimated fair value at the March 1, 2016 acquisition date.  As such, there is no allowance for loan losses associated with these loans as of September 30, 2016.  The unamortized acquisition date fair value adjustment related to these loans at September 30, 2016 was approximately $8,218, or 1.9% of the related aggregate outstanding loan balances.      
   
 The specific loan loss allowance (impaired loans) for both originated loans and acquired loans is the aggregate of the results of individual analyses prepared for each one of the impaired loans, excluding PCI loans.  Total impaired loans at September 30, 2016 are equal  to $19,516 ($17,508 originated impaired loans plus $2,008 acquired impaired  loans).   
   
 The Company recorded partial charge offs in lieu of specific allowance for a number of the impaired loans.   The Company s impaired loans have been written down  by $1,170 to $19,516 ($18,780 when the $736 specific allowance is considered) from their legal unpaid principal balance outstanding of $20,686.  In the aggregate , total impaired loans have been written down to  approximately 91% of their legal unpaid principal balance, and non-performing impaired loans have been written down to approximately 89% of their  legal unpaid principal balance.   Approximately $10,528 of the Company s impaired loans, or 54% of total impaired loans, are  accruing performing loans.  This group of impaired loans is not included in the Company s non-performing loans or non-performing assets categories.   
   
 PCI loans are accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 310-30.  PCI loan pools are evaluated for impairment each quarter.  If a pool is impaired, an allowance for loan loss is recorded.  
   
 The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is a charge to current period earnings and decreased by loan charge-offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge-offs. Loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely. We believe our allowance for loan losses was adequate at September 30, 2016. However, we  
   
 45 

recognize that many factors can adversely impact various segments of the Company s markets and customers, and therefore there   is no assurance as to the amount of losses or probable losses which may develop in the future.   
 The tables below summarize the changes in allowance for loan losses during the periods presented.  

Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets  
 Non-performing loans exclude PCI loans and are defined as non-accrual loans plus loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Generally, we place loans on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days and management believes the borrower s financial condition, after giving consideration to economic conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful. When we place a loan on non-accrual status, interest accruals cease and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Non-performing loans, as defined above, as a percentage of total non-PCI loans,  were 0.64% at September 30, 2016 , compared to 0.87% at December 31, 2015.  
 Non-performing assets (which we define as non-performing loans, as defined above, plus (a) OREO (i.e., real estate acquired  through foreclosure, in substance foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure); and (b) other repossessed assets that are not real estate), were $28,879 at September 30, 2016, compared to $32,174 at December 31, 2015. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total   
   
 46 

assets were   0.  58  %   at   September   30  , 2016, compared   to   0.80%      at December   31, 2015. The table below summarizes selected credit quality data at the dates indicated.   
 The table below summarizes selected credit quality data at the dates indicated.  

note 1:   
 
 Excludes PCI loans.     

 As shown in the table above, the largest component of non-performing loans  is non-accrual loans. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had non-accrual loans with an aggregate carrying value of $19,704 compared to December 31, 2015 when an aggregate book value of $20,833 was reported.   
   
 The second largest component of non-performing assets after non-accrual loans is OREO. At September 30, 2016, total OREO was $9,005 compared to $11,196 at December 31, 2015 (of which $9,629 was previously covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements).  On March 1, 2016, we acquired $6,774 in OREO from Community and Hometown after fair value adjustments.  OREO is carried at the lower of cost  or market less the estimated cost to sell. Further declines in real estate values can affect the market value of these assets. Any further decline in market value beyond its cost basis is recorded as a current expense in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.    
   
 Impaired loans are defined as loans that management has determined will not repay as agreed pursuant to the terms of the related loan agreement. Small balance homogeneous loans are not considered for impairment purposes. Once management has determined a loan is impaired, we perform a specific reserve analysis to determine if it is probable that we will eventually collect all contractual cash flows. If management determines that a shortfall is probable, then a specific valuation allowance is placed against the loan. This loan is then placed on non-accrual basis, even if the borrower is current with his/her contractual payments, and will remain on non-accrual until payments collected reduce the loan balance such that it eliminates the specific valuation allowance or equivalent partial charge-down or other economic conditions change. At September 30,  2016 we have identified a total of $19,516 impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. A specific valuation allowance of $736 has been attached to $5,362 of impaired loans included in the total $19,516 of identified impaired loans. It should also be noted that the total carrying balance of the impaired loans, or $19,516, has been partially charged down by $1,170 from their aggregate legal unpaid balance of $20,686.  

47 

The table below summarizes impaired loan data for the periods presented.     

Bank premises and equipment  
 Bank premises and equipment was $114,567 at September 30, 2016 compared to $101,821 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $12,746 or 12.5%.  The primary component of the increase is $22,814 of branch real estate acquired on March 1, 2016 with the purchase of Community and Hometown.  In addition, we transferred $10,139 of branch real estate that is no longer in use to held for sale at estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell.  A summary of our bank premises and  equipment for the period end indicated is presented in the table below.   

We transferred branch real estate that is no longer in use to held for sale at estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell and sold four properties during the nine months ending September 30, 2016.   Our branch real estate held for sale at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $9,355 and $1,665, respectively, a net increase of $7,690.  The reduction due to the four sold properties is offset by the transfers into held for  sale of $9,172, after impairment expense of $967 . 
   
 Interest Rate Swap Derivatives 
 The Company enters into interest rate swaps in order to provide commercial loan clients the ability to swap from fixed to variable interest rates. Under these agreements, the Company enters into a fixed-rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. This swap agreement effectively converts the client s fixed rate loan into a variable rate. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third party dealer in order to offset its exposure on the customer swap. The fair value of interest rate swap derivatives (asset component) was $63,207 at September 30, 2016 compared to $18,619 at December 31, 2015.  The fair value of interest rate swap derivatives (liability component) was $65,165 at September 30, 2016 compared to $19,822 at December 31, 2015.   

48 

Deposits     
 The cost of interest bearing deposits in the current quarter  is 0.27%, the same as the previous  quarter. The overall cost of total deposits (i.e. includes non-interest bearing checking accounts) in the current  quarter was 0.18% compared to 0.17% in the prior quarter .  On March 1, 2016, we acquired approximately $705.9 million in deposits from Community and Hometown.  See  Overview  for additional information on regarding this transaction. The table below summarizes the Company s deposit mix for the periods presented. 

.  
 Securities sold under agreement to repurchase  
 Our subsidiary bank enters into borrowing arrangements with our retail business customers by agreements to repurchase ( securities sold under agreements to repurchase ) under which the bank pledges investment securities owned and under their control as collateral against these one-day borrowing arrangement. These short-term borrowings totaled $ 26,889  at September 30, 2016 compared to $27,472 at December 31, 2015.   
 Federal funds purchased  
 Federal funds purchased are overnight deposits from correspondent banks. Federal funds purchased acquired from other than our correspondent bank deposits are included with Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other borrowed funds as described below, if any. At September 30, 2016 we had $258,329 of correspondent bank deposits or federal funds purchased, compared to $200,250 at December 31, 2015.  
 Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other borrowed funds  
 From time to time, we borrow either through Federal Home Loan Bank advances or Federal Funds Purchased, other than correspondent bank deposits (i.e. federal funds purchased) listed above. At September 30, 2016 there were no outstanding advances compared to $25,000 at December 31, 2015. 
 Corporate debentures  
 On January 22, 2016, we purchased, redeemed and terminated the Gulfstream Bancshares Capital Trust I $7,000 corporate debenture and recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $308.  On March 1, 2016, we assumed $16,000 in corporate debentures from Hometown of which we partially redeemed and terminated $6,000.  These corporate debentures were assumed through acquisitions, and as a result, were carried at less than par value at the time of termination.  
   
 Below is a schedule of statutory trust entities and the related corporate debentures formed and assumed through various acquisitions:

 Stockholders  equity at September 30, 2016 , was $552,771, or 11.0% of total  assets, compared to $490,514, or 12.2% of total assets at December 31, 2015. The increase in stockholders  equity was due to the following items: 

The federal bank regulatory agencies have established risk-based capital requirements for banks. These guidelines are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank s capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories. Banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against such  off- balance sheet  activities as loans sold with recourse, loan commitments, guarantees and standby letters of credit. These guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity such as preferred stock that may be included in capital. As of September 30, 2016, our subsidiary bank exceeded the minimum capital levels to be considered  well capitalized  under the terms of the guidelines.  
 The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules require financial institutions (including the Company and the Bank) to maintain minimum amounts and ratios. The Company and the Bank are now subject to a capital conservation buffer in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratios. The Company and Bank capital conservation buffer is determined by calculating the margin between the Company s and Bank s three risk-based asset ratios and the minimum required adequately capitalized ratio, with the lowest of the three margins resulting in the capital conservation buffer. The required buffer is phased in over three years beginning January 1, 2016, and the phase-in amount for 2016 is 0.625 percent of risk-weighted assets. Failure to maintain the buffer will result in restrictions on the ability to make capital distributions and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. As of September 30, 2016, management believes that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. 
 Selected consolidated capital ratios at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for the Company and for the Company s subsidiary bank, CenterState Bank of Florida, N.A., are presented in the tables below.

COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED   SEPTEMBER     30,   2016 AND 2015     
   
 Overview 
   
 We recognized net income of $15,384 or $0.32 per share basic and $0.32 per share diluted for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $9,916 or $0.22 per share basic and $0.22 per share diluted for the same period in 2015.  A summary of the differences are listed in the table below. 

The primary differences between the two quarters presented above relate to the acquisitions of Community and Hometown on March 1, 2016.  Other differences between both quarters include lower IA amortization expense due to the termination of FDIC loss share agreements in February 2016 and higher net interest income. 
 The increase in our net interest income relates primarily to the increase in our average interest earning assets as a result of loan growth. The increase in our  all other non interest expense,  which represents the operating expenses of our commercial/retail banking segment, is primarily due to the acquisition of Community and Hometown as of March 1, 2016. These items along with others are discussed and analyzed below.    
 Net interest income/margin 
 Net interest income increased $6,991 or 18.2% to $45,319 during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $38,328 for the same period in 2015. The $6,991 increase was the result of a $7,591 increase in interest income and a $600 increase in interest expense.  
 Interest earning assets averaged $4,467,735 during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $3,481,339 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $986,396, or 28.3%. The yield on average interest earning assets decreased 32 bps to 4.25% (31 bps to 4.33% tax equivalent basis) during the three month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to 4.57% (4.64% tax equivalent basis) for the same period in 2015. The combined effects of the $986,396 increase in average interest earning assets and the 32 bps (31 bps tax equivalent basis) decrease in yield on average interest earning assets resulted in the $7,591 ($7,932 tax equivalent basis) increase in interest income between the two periods.  
 Interest bearing liabilities averaged $2,914,374 during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $2,262,002 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $652,372 or 28.8%. The cost of average interest bearing liabilities was 0.33% during the three month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to 0.31% for the same period in 2015. The effect of the $652,372 increase in average interest bearing liabilities resulted in the $600 increase in interest expense between the two periods.

The table below summarizes the analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense for the three month periods ended   September   30  , 2016 and 2015 on a tax equivalent basis.     

note 1:   
 
 Loan balances are net of deferred origination fees and costs.     

note 3:   
 
 Includes federal funds sold, interest earned on deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank and earnings on Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.     

note 4:   
 
 Includes interest bearing deposits only. Non-interest bearing checking accounts are included in the demand deposits listed above. Also, includes net amortization of fair market value adjustments related to various acquisitions of time deposits of ($268) and ($147) for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     

note 5:   
 
 Includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.     

note 6:   
 
 Represents the average rate earned on interest earning assets minus the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities.     

note 7:   
 
 Represents net interest income divided by total interest earning assets.     

note 8:   
 
 Interest income and rates include the effects of a tax equivalent adjustment using applicable statutory tax rates to adjust tax exempt interest income on tax exempt investment securities and loans to a fully taxable basis.     

The primary reason for the decrease in our net interest margin ( NIM ) during the current period was due to the mix of interest earning assets between the two periods presented above.  Higher average balances in lower yielding assets, such as taxable securities and federal funds sold, and lower average balances in higher yielding assets, such as PCI loans, during the three month period ending September 30, 2016 compared to the three month period ending September 30, 2015 contributed to the decrease in NIM.   
 The Company acquired two banks, Community and Hometown (the  Homestead banks ), on March 1, 2016.  As such, the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were fully integrated into the current quarter averages and income, resulting in a yield reduction on PCI loans due to the lower yield on the Homestead banks acquired PCI loans.  The Homestead banks PCI loans have an average yield of 8.32% which is lower than the Company s existing average yield.   

Provision for loan losses  
   
 The provision for loan losses increased $1,275 to $1,275 during the three month period ending September 30, 2016 compared to no provision expense for the comparable period in 2015. Our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to  
   
 52 

absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The al  lowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is a charge to current period earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries on prior loan charge-offs. Therefore, the provision for loan losses (Income Statement effect) is a resid  ual of management s determination of allowance for loan losses (Balance Sheet approach). In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we consider the conditions of individual borrowers, the historical loan loss experience, the general econ  omic environment, the overall portfolio composition, and other information. As these factors change, the level of loan loss provision changes.  The decrease in our loan loss provision between the comparable periods is   a result of net recoveries versus net   charge-offs, as well as   improved   credit metrics used to determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses. See  Credit quality and allowance for loan losses  for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses.   
 Non-interest income  
 Non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $15,614 compared to $8,130 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was the result of the following components listed in the table below.  

note 1:   
 
 Includes gross commissions earned on bond sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokering fees and related consulting fees.  The fee income in this category is based on sales volume in any particular period and is therefore volatile between comparable periods.           

note 2:   
 
 Includes fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services, asset/liability consulting services, international wires, clearing and corporate checking account services and other correspondent banking related revenue and fees.  The fees included in this category are less volatile than those described above in note 1.      

  Income from correspondent banking capital markets division  increased between the two periods presented above due to increased fees from hedging services and loan brokering fees.  Service charges on deposit accounts increased $1,282 in part due to the acquisitions of Community and Hometown on March 1, 2016 and new product changes on personal and business accounts during the current quarter.  In addition, the termination of the FDIC loss share agreements in February 2016 resulted in no further FDIC indemnification asset amortization during the three month period ending September 30, 2016 which increased non-interest income by $4,144 compared to the same period in 2015.   

53 

Non-interest expense   
 Non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $5,473, or 17.7%, to $36,328, compared to $30,855 for the same period in 2015. Components of our non-interest expenses are listed in the table below.  

note 1:   
 
 These are foreclosure and repossession related expenses related to FDIC covered assets, and are shown net of FDIC reimbursable amounts pursuant to FDIC loss share agreements.     

 The primary reason for the increase in non-interest expense relates to the acquisitions of Community and Hometown.  Both acquisitions closed on March 1, 2016 and were fully integrated into the Company during the second quarter of 2016.  The increase in salaries and wages between the periods presented above is due primarily to the increase in personnel as a result of the acquisitions of Community and Hometown as mentioned above. 
 Provision for income taxes  
 We recognized an income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $7,946 on pre-tax income of $23,330 (an effective tax rate of 34.1%) compared to an income tax expense of $5,687 on pre-tax income of $15,603 (an effective tax rate of 36.4%) for the comparable quarter in 2015.  The primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rates is due to a larger percentage  
   
 54 

of tax exempt interest income relative   to   total revenue   and the impa  ct of CSFL Insurance Corp, the C  ompany s captive insuran  ce subsidiary, incorporated in December 2015 pursuant to section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code.  
   
 COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  
   
 Overview 
   
 We recognized net income of $26,314 or $0.55 per share basic and diluted for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to net income of $28,942 or $0.64 per share basic and $0.63 per share diluted for the same period in 2015.  A summary of the differences are listed in the table below. 

The primary differences between the two periods presented above relate to the termination of the FDIC loss share agreements in February 2016 resulting in a charge of $17,560 and merger related expenses of $11,172 for the acquisitions of Community and Hometown on March 1, 2016.  Other differences between both periods include lower IA amortization expense due to the termination of FDIC loss share agreements as stated above, increased correspondent revenue from our capital markets division and higher net interest income. 
 The increase in our net interest income relates primarily to the increase in our average interest earning assets as a result of loan growth. The increase in our  all other non interest expense,  which represents the operating expenses of our commercial/retail banking segment, is primarily due to the acquisition of Community and Hometown as of March 1, 2016. These items along with others are discussed and analyzed below.    
 Net interest income/margin 
 Net interest income increased $16,036 or 13.9% to $131,791 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $115,755 for the same period in 2015. The $16,036 increase was the result of a $17,288 increase in interest income and a $1,252 increase in interest expense.  
 Interest earning assets averaged $4,272,762 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $3,439,412 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $833,350, or 24.2%. The yield on average interest earning assets decreased 38 bps to 4.33% (36 bps to 4.41% tax equivalent basis) during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to 4.71% (4.77% tax equivalent basis) for the same period in 2015. The combined effects of the $833,350 increase in average interest earning assets and the 38 bps (36 bps tax equivalent basis) decrease in yield on average interest earning assets resulted in the $17,288 ($18,138 tax equivalent basis) increase in interest income between the two periods.  
   
 55 

Interest bearing liabilities averaged $  2,769,931   during the   nine   month period ended   September   30, 2016 as compared to $  2,261,929   for the same period in 2015, an increase of   $  508,002   or   22.5%  .   The cost of average interest bearing liabilities   was   0.32% during the   nine   month period ended   September   30, 2016, compared to   0.32%   fo  r the same period in 2015. The   effect of the   $508,002   increase in avera  ge interest bearing liabilities     resulted in the   $1,252   increase in interest expense between the two periods.   
 The table below summarizes the analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 on a tax equivalent basis.  

note 1:   
 
 Loan balances are net of deferred origination fees and costs.     

note 3:   
 
 Includes federal funds sold, interest earned on deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank and earnings on Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.     

note 4:   
 
 Includes interest bearing deposits only. Non-interest bearing checking accounts are included in the demand deposits listed above. Also, includes net amortization of fair market value adjustments related to various acquisitions of time deposits of ($805) and ($549) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     

note 5:   
 
 Includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Federal Home Loan Bank advances.

 The Company acquired the two Homestead banks on March 1, 2016.  As such, the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were included in the averages for the nine months period ending September 30, 2016, but only for seven months, resulting in a yield reduction on PCI loans due to the lower yield on the Homestead acquired PCI loans.     

56 

Provision for loan losses   
   
 The provision for loan losses decreased $1,254 to $2,696 during the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 compared to provision expense of $3,950 for the comparable period in 2015. Our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is a charge to current period earnings, and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries on prior loan charge-offs. Therefore, the provision for loan losses (Income Statement effect) is a residual of management s determination of allowance for loan losses (Balance Sheet approach).

See  Credit quality and allowance for loan losses  for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses.  
 Non-interest income  
 Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $47,146 compared to $27,784 for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was the result of the following components listed in the table below.  

note 1:   
 
 Includes gross commissions earned on bond sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokering fees and related consulting fees.  The fee income in this category is based on sales volume in any particular period and is therefore volatile between comparable periods.           

note 2:   
 
 Includes fees from safe-keeping activities, bond accounting services, asset/liability consulting services, international wires, clearing and corporate checking account services and other correspondent banking related revenue and fees.  The fees included in this category are less volatile than those described above in note 1.      

  Income from correspondent banking capital markets division  increased between the two periods presented above due to increased fees from hedging services and loan brokering fees.  In addition, the termination of the FDIC loss share agreements in February resulted in no further FDIC indemnification asset amortization which increased non-interest income by $11,977 compared to the same period in 2015.  Service charges on deposit accounts increased $2,666 in part due to the acquisitions of Community and Hometown on March 1, 2016 and new product changes on personal and business accounts during the current year.  Lastly, the early extinguishment of trust preferred debt during the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 resulted in a gain of $308. 

57 

Non-interest expense   
 Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $42,234, or 44.9%, to $136,230, compared to $93,996 for the same period in 2015. Components of our non-interest expenses are listed in the table below.  

note 1:   
 
 These are foreclosure and repossession related expenses related to FDIC covered assets, and are shown net of FDIC reimbursable amounts pursuant to FDIC loss share agreements.     

 Excluding net impairments on bank property held for sale, lease termination recovery, merger related expenses and charges related to termination of FDIC loss sharing agreements, our non-interest expenses increased $12,744, or 13.6% to $106,531 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $93,787 during the same period last year.  The overall primary reason for the increase relates to the acquisitions of Community and Hometown on March 1, 2016.   

58 

Provision for income taxes   
 We recognized an income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $13,697 on pre-tax income of $40,011 (an effective tax rate of 34.2%) compared to an income tax expense of $16,651 on pre-tax income of $45,593 (an effective tax rate of 36.5%) for the comparable period in 2015.  The primary reason for the decrease in the effective tax rates is due to a larger percentage of tax exempt interest income relative to total revenue and the impact of CSFL Insurance Corp, the Company s captive insurance subsidiary, incorporated in December 2015 pursuant to section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. 
 Liquidity  
 Liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis.  
 Our subsidiary bank regularly assesses the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned business activities. The subsidiary bank s asset/liability committee (ALCO) provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends guidelines, subject to the approval of its board of directors, and courses of action to address actual and projected liquidity needs.  
 Short term sources of funding and liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities; investment securities eligible for pledging to secure borrowings from customers pursuant to securities sold under repurchase agreements; loan repayments; deposits and certain interest rate-sensitive deposits; and borrowings under overnight federal fund lines available from correspondent banks. In addition to interest rate-sensitive deposits, the primary demand for liquidity is anticipated fundings under credit commitments to customers.  
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements except for approved and unfunded loans and letters of credit to our customers in the ordinary course of business.  

ITEM  3.   
 
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES: MARKET RISK     

 Market risk  
 We believe interest rate risk is the most significant market risk impacting us. We monitor and manage interest rate risk using interest rate sensitivity  gap  analysis to measure the impact of market interest rate changes on net interest income. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 for disclosure of the quantitative and qualitative information regarding the interest rate risk inherent in interest rate risk sensitive instruments as of December 31, 2015. There have been no changes in the assumptions used in monitoring interest rate risk as of September 30, 2016. The impact of other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk, is deemed immaterial.  

ITEM 4.   
 
     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     

 As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)) during the quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
