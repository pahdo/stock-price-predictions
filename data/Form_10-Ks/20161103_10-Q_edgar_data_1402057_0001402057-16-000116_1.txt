    Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Description of Business 
  CDW Corporation ( Parent ) is a Fortune 500 company with multi-national capabilities and a leading provider of integrated information technology ( IT ) solutions to small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The Company's offerings range from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration. 
  Throughout this report, the terms the  Company  and  CDW  refer to Parent and its 100% owned subsidiaries. 
  Parent has two 100% owned subsidiaries, CDW LLC and CDW Finance Corporation. CDW LLC is an Illinois limited liability company that, together with its 100% owned subsidiaries, holds all material assets and conducts all business activities and operations of the Company. CDW Finance Corporation is a Delaware corporation formed for the sole purpose of acting as co-issuer of certain debt obligations and does not hold any material assets or engage in any business activities or operations. 
    
  On August 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Kelway TopCo Limited ( Kelway ) by purchasing the remaining   65%   of its outstanding common stock, which increased the Company s ownership interest from   35%   to   100%  , and provided the Company control. On April 4, 2016, Kelway was rebranded CDW UK. Throughout this report, the term "CDW UK" refers to Kelway. For further details regarding the acquisition, see Note 3 (Acquisition). 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements as of   September 30, 2016   and for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   (the  Consolidated Financial Statements ) have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  December 31, 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements ). The significant accounting policies used in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements were applied on a basis consistent with those reflected in the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements. In the opinion of management, the Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of a normal, recurring nature) necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity as of the dates and for the periods indicated. The unaudited results of operations for such interim periods reported are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.  
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Parent and its 100% owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  The notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements include an additional discussion of the significant accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. There have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies and estimates during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
     Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230), providing guidance for eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. This ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018 and allows for early adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU introduces a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. The estimate of expected credit losses will require considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expands the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and allows for early adoption beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, requiring the recognition of the excess tax benefits of stock awards in the provision for income taxes in the income statement when the awards are settled and allowing the Company to repurchase more of an employee's shares for tax withholding purposes than allowed under current guidance, without triggering liability accounting. This ASU also addresses simplifications related to statement of cash flows classification and accounting for forfeitures. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and allows for early adoption. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the third quarter of 2016, requiring the Company to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. As a result of the adoption of this ASU, the Company recorded a   $1.2 million   tax benefit in its Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  Accounting for Leases 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and allows for early adoption. Although the Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the ASU to determine how it will be affected, the primary impact of the new ASU will be to record assets and liabilities for current operating leases. 
  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring all deferred taxes to be presented as noncurrent in the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, amending the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value instead of the lower of cost or market value. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2017, allows for early adoption and must be applied prospectively after the date of adoption. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), replacing most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP and eliminating industry specific guidance. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods and services equal to an amount it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods and services.  
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, deferring the effective date by one year.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Gross versus Net), clarifying the principal versus agent guidance in the new revenue recognition standard, by revising the indicators to focus on evidence that the company is a principal.  
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, reducing the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and clarifying how to determine whether revenue related to a performance obligation for an intellectual property license is recognized over time or at a point in time. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, clarifying certain core recognition principles including collectability, sales tax presentation, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition.  
  These ASUs are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, allow for early adoption in the first quarter of 2017 and may be applied using either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact these ASUs will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
           3. 
    Acquisition 
       
  On   August 1, 2015  , the Company completed the acquisition of CDW UK by purchasing the remaining   65%   of its outstanding common stock, which increased the Company's ownership interest from   35%   to   100%  , and provided the Company control.  
  A summary of the total consideration transferred is as follows: 

(1) 
    The Company issued   2 million   shares of CDW common stock. The fair value of the common stock was based on the closing market price on   July 31, 2015  , adjusted for the lack of marketability as the shares of CDW common stock issued to the sellers are subject to a   three  -year lock up restriction from   August 1, 2015  . One of the sellers granted   1 million   stock options to certain CDW UK coworkers over his shares of CDW common stock received in the transaction. The fair value of these stock options was   $22 million  , which has been accounted for as post-combination stock-based compensation and is being amortized over the weighted -average requisite service period of   3.2   years. Compensation expense for these options is included in Selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
              (2) 
    As a result of the Company obtaining control over CDW UK, the Company s previously held   35%   equity investment was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of   $98 million   included in Gain on remeasurement of equity investment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the previously held equity investment was determined by management with the assistance of a third party valuation firm, based on information available as of the acquisition date.

The recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, translated using the foreign currency exchange rates on the date of acquisition, are as follows: 

(1) 
    The fair values assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.     
              (2) 
    Details of the identified intangible assets are as follows: 

Goodwill in the amount of   $306 million   was recognized in the acquisition of CDW UK and is attributable to the business from new customers and the value of the acquired assembled workforce. The goodwill was allocated to the CDW UK operating segment which is included with CDW Canada in an all other category ( Other ).

    Inventory Financing Agreements 
     The Company has entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company does not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. Amounts included in Accounts payable-inventory financing are as follows: 

(1) 
    The Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility ( Revolving Loan ) includes an inventory floorplan sub-facility that enables the Company to maintain an inventory financing agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from certain vendors on more favorable terms than offered directly by the vendors. 
              (2) 
    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , amounts owed under other inventory financing agreements of   $1 million   or less, for both periods, were collateralized by the inventory purchased under these financing agreements and a second lien on the related accounts receivable.

Long-term debt as of December 31, 2015 is as follows: 

(1) 
    The Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility includes an inventory floorplan sub-facility that enables the Company to maintain an inventory financing agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from certain vendors on more favorable terms than offered directly by the vendors. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Loan,   $1 million   of undrawn letters of credit and   $446 million   reserved related to the floorplan sub-facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrowing base was   $1,584 million   based on the amount of eligible inventory and accounts receivable balances as of August 31, 2016. The Company could have borrowed up to an additional   $802 million   under the Revolving Loan as of   September 30, 2016  .  
              (2) 
    The CDW UK Revolving Credit Facility is a multi-currency revolving credit facility expiring on August 1, 2021, under which CDW UK is permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of    50 million   (  $65 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ). 
       Debt Covenants 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company remained in compliance with the covenants under its various credit agreements, the most restrictive of which is under the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ("Term Loan"). Under the Term Loan, there are restrictions on the ability of CDW to pay dividends, make share repurchases, redeem subordinated debt and engage in certain other transactions. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of CDW s restricted payment capacity under the Term Loan was   $680 million  . However, the Company is separately permitted to make restricted payments, so long as the total net leverage ratio is less than   3.25   on a pro forma basis. The total net leverage ratio was   2.9   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  The CDW UK Term Loan Agreement imposes restrictions on CDW UK's ability to transfer funds to the Company through the payment of dividends, intercompany loans, advances or the repayment of subordinated debt that require, among other things, the maintenance of a minimum net leverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of CDW UK's restricted payment capacity under the CDW UK Term Loan was   $120 million  .

Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ( Term Loan ) 
  On August 17, 2016, the Company entered into a new seven-year $  1,490 million   aggregate principal amount senior secured term loan facility ("Term Loan"). The Term Loan was issued at a price that was   99.5%   of par, which resulted in a discount of   $7 million  . Fees of   $5 million   were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the seven-year term on a straight-line basis. The Term Loan replaced the prior senior secured term loan facility (the  Prior Term Loan Facility ) that had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of   $1,490 million  . In connection with this refinancing, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of   $2 million   in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This loss represented the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized discount related to the Prior Term Loan Facility.   
  The Company is required to pay quarterly principal installments equal to   0.25%   of the original principal amount of the Term Loan, with the remaining principal amount payable on the maturity date of August 17, 2023. The quarterly principal installment payments of   $4 million   commenced during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan was   $1,487 million  , excluding   $16 million   of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. 
  Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at either (a) the alternate base rate ( ABR ) plus a margin or (b) LIBOR plus a margin; provided that for the purposes of the Term Loan, LIBOR shall not be less than   0.75%   per annum at any time ( LIBOR Floor ), payable quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December. The margin is based upon a net leverage ratio as defined in the agreement governing the Term Loan which is   1.25%   for ABR borrowings and   2.25%   for LIBOR borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, an interest rate of   3.0%   was in effect, which represents the LIBOR Floor plus a   2.25%   margin. 
  CDW UK Term Loan 
  On August 1, 2016, the Company entered into a new five-year    56 million   (  $72 million   as of September 30, 2016) aggregate principal amount term loan facility ("CDW UK Term Loan"). The CDW UK Term Loan replaced the prior senior secured term loan facility (the  Prior CDW UK Term Loan Facility ) that had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of    56 million  .  
  The Company is required to pay annual principal installments of    5 million  , with the remaining principal amount payable on the maturity date of August 1, 2021. The annual principal installment payments will commence during the quarter ended September 30, 2018. At September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal amount of the CDW UK Term Loan was    56 million  , excluding    0.5 million   (  $0.6 million   as of September 30, 2016) of unamortized deferred financing costs. 
  Borrowings under the CDW UK Term Loan bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin, payable quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December. As of September 30, 2016, an interest rate of   1.79%   was in effect, which represents LIBOR plus a   0.39%   margin. 
  In connection with this refinancing, the Prior CDW UK Term Loan Facility was amended to include both the CDW UK Term Loan and a    50.0 million   revolving credit facility ("CDW UK Revolving Credit Facility"). The CDW UK Revolving Credit Facility replaced the prior    50 million   revolving credit facility and expires on August 1, 2021. As of September 30, 2016, there were   no   outstanding borrowings under the CDW UK Revolving Credit Facility.   
    Fair Value 
  The fair values of the 2022, 2023 and 2024 Senior Notes were estimated using quoted market prices for identical liabilities that are traded in over-the-counter secondary markets that are not considered active. The fair value of the Term Loan was estimated using dealer quotes for identical liabilities in markets that are not considered active. Consequently, the Company's long-term debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the CDW UK Term Loan was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar arrangements. The approximate fair values and related carrying values of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities and excluding unamortized discount and unamortized deferred financing costs, were as follows:

Interest Rate Cap Agreements 
  In order to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates on borrowings under the Term Loan, the Company maintains interest rate cap agreements. As of   September 30, 2016   the interest rate cap agreements had a combined notional amount of   $1,400 million   and are effective from January 14, 2015 through January 14, 2017. Under these agreements, the Company has the right to receive payments equal to the amount, if any, by which the three-month LIBOR exceeds   2.0%   during the agreement period. The fair value of the Company's interest rate cap agreements was less than   $1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  In connection with the upcoming expiration of the interest rate cap agreements noted above in the first quarter of 2017, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company entered into eleven additional interest rate cap agreements for a combined notional amount of   $1,200 million  . Under these agreements, the Company made premium payments totaling   $2 million   to the counterparties in exchange for the right to receive payments equal to the amount, if any, by which three-month LIBOR exceeds   1.5%   during the agreement period. These interest rate cap agreements are effective from January 14, 2017 through December 31, 2018. The fair value of these interest rate cap agreements was   $2 million   at September 30, 2016. 
       
  The Company s interest rate cap agreements have not been designated as cash flow hedges for interest rate risk for GAAP accounting purposes. The interest rate cap agreements are recorded at fair value on the Company s consolidated balance sheet in Other Assets each period, with changes in fair value recorded directly to interest expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the Company s interest rate cap agreements is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The valuation of the interest rate cap agreements is derived by using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rates of the caps. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate cap agreements, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including LIBOR curves and implied volatilities. The Company also incorporates insignificant credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. The counterparty credit spreads are based on publicly available credit information obtained from a third party credit data provider. 
   
           6. 
    Earnings per Share 
     The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is Net income. The denominator for basic earnings per share is the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period. A reconciliation of basic weighted-average shares outstanding to diluted weighted-average shares outstanding is as follows: 

(1) 
    The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance share units and Coworker Stock Purchase Plan units is reflected in the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. 
       
           (2) 
    There were less than   1 million   potential common shares excluded from diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, as their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     The Company is party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business, which include commercial, intellectual property, employment, tort and other litigation matters. The Company is also subject to audit by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local authorities, and by various partners, group purchasing organizations and customers, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales under various contracts. In addition, the Company is subject to indemnification claims under various contracts. From time to time, certain customers of the Company file voluntary petitions for reorganization or liquidation under the US bankruptcy laws or similar laws of the jurisdictions for the Company s business activities outside of the US. In such cases, certain pre-petition payments received by the Company could be considered preference items and subject to return to the bankruptcy administrator. 
  On October 29, 2015, the Company learned of an investigation by the SEC of the Company s vendor partner program incentives. The SEC s investigation is ongoing, and the Company is continuing to cooperate with the SEC in this matter. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters, if any, has been incurred. However, the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable. As such, the Company's financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters. 
   
           8. 
    Segment Information 
     The Company has   two   reportable segments: Corporate, which is comprised primarily of private sector business customers in the US, and Public, which is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the US. The Company has   two   other operating segments: CDW Canada and CDW UK, both of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ( Other ). Effective January 1, 2016, CDW Advanced Services is no longer an operating segment. Its results have been allocated to the Corporate and Public segments to align the Company's financial reporting with the manner in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker assesses performance and makes resource allocation decisions. Segment information reported in prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  the terms  we,   us,   the Company,   our,   CDW  and similar terms refer to CDW Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report and with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

  Overview 
  CDW is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ( IT ) solutions in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. With our multinational capabilities, we help our customer base of over 250,000 small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers by delivering critical solutions to their increasingly complex IT needs. Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration. We are technology  agnostic,  with a product portfolio including more than 100,000 products from more than 1,000 brands. We provide our products and solutions through more than   5,000   customer-facing coworkers, including field sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers. 
  We are a leading sales channel partner in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom for many original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) and software publishers (collectively, our  vendor partners ), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. We believe we are an important extension of our vendor partners  sales and marketing capabilities, providing them with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage and extensive customer access. 
  On August 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Kelway TopCo Limited ( Kelway ) by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock, which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100%, and provided us control. On April 4, 2016, Kelway was rebranded CDW UK. Throughout this report, the term  CDW UK  refers to Kelway. CDW UK is a UK-based IT solutions provider which has global supply chain relationships that enable it to conduct business in more than 80 countries. This investment strengthens our ability to provide a more comprehensive solution to our customers and enhances our ability to serve our existing multi-national customers. We included the financial results of CDW UK in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. For additional information relating to the acquisition, see Note 3 (Acquisition) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We have two reportable segments, Corporate, which is comprised primarily of private sector business customers in the US, and Public, which is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the US. Our Corporate segment is divided into a medium/large business customer channel, primarily serving customers with more than 100 employees, and a small business customer channel, primarily serving customers with up to 100 employees. 
  We also have two other operating segments: CDW Canada and CDW UK, both of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ( Other ). Effective January 1, 2016, CDW Advanced Services is no longer an operating segment. Its results have been allocated to the Corporate and Public segments to align our financial reporting with the manner in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker assesses performance and makes resource allocation decisions. Segment information reported in prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  
  We may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. We also resell software for major software publishers. Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. These programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.

Trends and key factors affecting our financial performance 
  We believe the following trends may have an important impact on our financial performance: 

Our Public segment sales are impacted by government spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels. An adverse change in any of these factors could cause our Public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. Meeting public safety needs continues to drive our sales growth from our state and local customers and we continue to benefit from the strategic changes made to better align with federal government purchasing programs for our federal customers. Sales growth in our education sales channel continues to be benefited by the implementation of projects related to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission E-Rate program and schools developing digital testing and curriculum programs. Although the Healthcare industry continues to experience consolidation, some customers that have moved through the merger process began to implement projects that had been on hold previously.  

An important factor affecting our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted operating results is the impact of general economic conditions on our customers  willingness to spend on information technology. Global economic signals in 2016 continue to be mixed and the ongoing impact of economic uncertainty continued to cause many customers in our Medium/Large sales channel to put longer tail projects on hold and to extend decision cycles. Also, there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the Referendum on the United Kingdom s ( UK ) Membership of the European Union ( EU ) (referred to as  Brexit ), advising for the exit of the UK from the EU. Potential adverse consequences of Brexit such as global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between UK and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, uncertainties related to potential changes in tax and regulatory policy, potential interest rate increases, weakening consumer and business confidence or increased unemployment could result in reduced or deferred spending on information technology products and services by our customers and result in increased competitive pricing pressures. We continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions and adjust our operational plans, including hiring plans, appropriately.  

We believe that our customers  transition to more complex technology solutions will continue to be an important growth area for us in the future. However, because the market for technology products and services is highly competitive, our success at capitalizing on this transition will be based on our ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, the quality and breadth of our product and service offerings, the knowledge and expertise of our sales force, price, product availability and speed of delivery.  
       
  Key business metrics 
  Our management monitors a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include Net income, average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, return on invested capital, cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.  
  Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. 
  We believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ( Term Loan ) used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.

(1) 
    As a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU)  2015-15, which allows companies to present deferred financing costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset, we retrospectively adjusted the deferred financing costs and long-term debt liability presented in the September 30, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet to align it to the current period presentation.

Net sales 
  Net sales by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of total Net sales, and the year-over-year dollar and percentage change in Net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   are as follows: 

(1) 
    Effective January 1, 2016, CDW Advanced Services is included in our Corporate and Public segments and Other is comprised of CDW Canada and CDW UK. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  
      Total Net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $207 million  , or   5.9%  , to   $3,708 million  , compared to   $3,501 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of currency translation, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased   $227 million  , or 6.5%, to $3,708 million, compared to $3,481 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. See  Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations  below for additional information. Additionally, net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 reflects the impact of consolidating three and two months of CDW UK, respectively. 
  Corporate segment net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   $16 million  , or   0.9%  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This slight decrease was due to a decline in solutions-related products, partially offset by growth in transactional products with both medium/large and small business customers. Within our Corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers decreased   $27 million  , or   1.8%  , between periods, primarily due to a decline in solutions-related products as the ongoing impact of economic uncertainty continued to cause many customers to put longer tail projects on hold and to extend decision cycles. The decline in net sales to medium/large customers was partially offset by growth in transactional products. Net sales to small business customers increased by   $11 million  , or   4.1%  , between periods, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices.  
  Public segment net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $157 million  , or   10.6%  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , with relatively balanced growth between solutions and transactional products. The increase was a result of growth in all three of our sales channels within the Public segment. Net sales to our state and local customers experienced strong growth as a continued focus on public safety and the addition of new contracts drove strong results. Net sales to federal government customers grew modestly compared to the prior year's strong results. Although we continued to benefit from the strategic changes made to better align with federal government purchasing programs for our federal customers, delivery of several larger transactional orders, including notebooks, will occur in the fourth quarter. Net sales to education customers increased   $88 million  , or   15.1%  , between periods, driven by strong growth from our K-12 customers and mid-single digit growth from our higher education customers. Growth from our K-12 customers was led by transactional products, particularly notebooks/mobile devices, as a result of schools continuing to develop digital testing and curriculum programs, which was partially offset

by a decrease in netcomm products reflecting a delay in funds related to projects for the U.S. Federal Communications Commission E-Rate program. Sales to our higher education customers grew mid-single digits as we continued to see the benefit from programs directed at select institutions by optimizing opportunities with available budgets as solution-related products grew faster than transactional products. Net sales to healthcare customers increased   6.1%   between periods primarily driven by software as some customers began to implement projects that had been on hold due to consolidation activity within the healthcare industry.    
  Net sales in Other for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $66 million  , or   26.2%  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Other is comprised of CDW Canada and CDW UK. The increase in net sales was driven by the impact of consolidating three months of CDW UK net sales in the current period compared to only two months of CDW UK net sales in the prior period. Additionally, CDW Canada experienced a mid-single digit increase in net sales and reflected minimal impact from foreign currency translation for the current period. CDW UK net sales were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation. 
   
  Gross profit 
  Gross profit increased   $47 million  , or   8.3%  , to   $614 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $567 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit   increased     40   basis points to   16.6%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , up from   16.2%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Our continuing mix into net service contract revenue, including items such as third-party services, warranties, software assurance and Software as a Service ( SaaS ), contributed a positive impact of 30 basis points to gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to Net sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction. We experienced a favorable impact of 30 basis points from vendor partner funding, which includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising, and 10 basis points from the inclusion of CDW UK, which has a higher mix of services.  These increases were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable product price/mix changes. 
  Gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors. 
   
  Selling and administrative expenses 
  Selling and administrative expenses   increased     $14 million  , or   4.2%  , to   $335 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $321 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses   decreased     20   basis points to   9.0%   in the   third quarter of 2016  ,   down   from   9.2%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Sales payroll costs increased $12 million, or 8.3%, between quarters, primarily due to incremental coworkers hired since the   third   quarter of 2015, higher costs consistent with increased Net sales and Gross profit and the inclusion of CDW UK coworker costs. Total coworker count was   8,565  , up   296   from   8,269   at   September 30, 2015  . Total coworker count was 8,465 at   December 31, 2015  . Non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased   $2 million  , or   28.5%  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the prior year period, primarily due to annual equity awards granted under our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2016 and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of CDW UK.

Income from operations 
  Income from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   is as follows: 

* Not meaningful 
           (1) 
    Segment income from operations includes the segment s direct operating income, allocations for Headquarters  costs, allocations for income and expenses from logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors. 
              (2) 
    Certain costs related to technology specialists have been reclassified between our Corporate and Public segments. The prior period has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  
              (3) 
    Effective January 1, 2016, CDW Advanced Services is included in our Corporate and Public segments and Other is comprised of CDW Canada and CDW UK. The prior period has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
              (4) 
    Includes the financial results for our other operating segments, CDW Canada and CDW UK, which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds. 
              (5) 
    Includes certain Headquarters  function costs that are not allocated to the segments. Certain Headquarters expenses have been allocated to CDW Canada in 2016. The prior period has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
     Income from operations was   $238 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $33 million  , or   16.1%  , compared to   $205 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Total operating margin percentage   increased     60   basis points to   6.4%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   5.8%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Operating margin percentage was positively impacted by increased gross profit driven by a higher mix of net service contract revenue, as well as higher volume rebates. Partially offsetting the increase in operating margin percentage was an increase in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales driven by incremental coworkers hired since the third quarter of 2015, higher costs consistent with increased Net sales and Gross profit and the inclusion of CDW UK coworker costs. 
  Corporate segment income from operations was   $138 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $14 million  , or   11.3%  , compared to   $124 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Corporate segment operating margin percentage   increased     90   basis points to   7.9%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   7.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit driven by a higher mix of net service contract revenue, as well as higher volume rebates, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, due to higher sales payroll costs. 
  Public segment income from operations was   $120 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $16 million  , or   15.2%  , compared to   $104 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Public segment operating margin percentage was   7.3  % and   7.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The   30   basis point increase in operating margin percentage was driven by a higher mix of net service contract revenue and higher volume rebates, partially offset by unfavorable product price/mix changes.  
  Other income from operations was   $10 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $5 million  , or   98.9%  , compared to   $5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This was primarily due to the inclusion of CDW UK income from operations. Other operating margin percentage   increased     110   basis points to   3.1%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   2.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to higher

gross profit, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, driven by higher intangibles amortization expense from our acquisition of CDW UK. 

Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt 
  For information regarding our debt, see Note 5 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was a $2.1 million net loss on extinguishment of long-term debt, which represents the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized discount related to the Prior Term Loan Facility.  There was no net loss on extinguishment of long-term debt for the same period of 2015.  

Income tax expense 
  Income tax expense was   $72 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $95 million   for the same period of the prior year. The effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating the income tax expense as a percentage of Income before income taxes, was   36.5%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   38.7%   for the same period of the prior year and differed in both periods from the US federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a $1.2 million tax benefit upon the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (the "FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, along with a $1.5 million deferred tax benefit as a result of a change in tax law that reduces the UK tax rate in a future period. For the same period of the prior year, we accrued $3.3 million of withholding tax on the unremitted earnings of our Canadian business as a result of no longer asserting these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations 
  We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   below.  
  Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period. 
  Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. 
  We believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ( Term Loan ) used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.

              (6) 
    For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the aggregate adjustment for income taxes is based on applying a statutory effective tax rate of 36.0% to the amount of pre-tax adjustments.  In addition, the aggregate adjustment for income taxes includes $2.7 million of discrete tax benefits recorded in the quarter: $1.5 million related to the adjustment to the deferred tax liability for the acquired intangibles due to a future tax rate reduction in the UK, and $1.2 million for the stock compensation tax benefit related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the adjustment was based on a statutory effective tax rate of 38.0% (39.0% prior to the CDW UK acquisition), except for the non-cash equity-based compensation from our equity investment and the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of CDW UK, which were tax effected at a rate of 35.4%. Includes additional tax expense during the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $3.3 million as a result of recording withholding tax on the unremitted earnings of the Company's Canadian subsidiary.   
              (7) 
    Includes the impact of consolidating two months of CDW UK's financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Net sales 
  Net sales by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of total Net sales, and the year-over-year dollar and percentage change in Net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   are as follows: 

(1) 
    Effective January 1, 2016, CDW Advanced Services is included in our Corporate and Public segments and Other is comprised of CDW Canada and CDW UK. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  
      Total net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $919 million  , or   9.6%  , to   $10,489 million  , compared to   $9,570 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . On an average daily sales basis, total net sales increased 9.0%. Net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of currency translation, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $957 million, or 10.0%, to $10,489 million, compared to $9,532 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. See  Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations  below for additional information. Additionally, net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 reflects the impact of consolidating nine and two months of CDW UK, respectively. 
  Corporate segment net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $47 million  , or   0.9%  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . On an average daily sales basis, Corporate segment net sales were up slightly at   0.4%  , as growth in transactional products was offset by a decline in solutions-related products. Within our Corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased   $9 million  , or   0.2%  , between periods, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile device products. This growth was partially offset by declines in solution-focused products, including netcomm products and server-related products such as memory, due to ongoing impact of economic uncertainty which continued to cause many customers to put longer tail projects on hold and to extend decision cycles. Net sales to small business customers increased by   $37 million  , or   4.5%  , between periods, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices. 
  Public segment net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $367 million  , or   9.4%   between periods, driven by growth in our transactional and solution-based products. On an average daily sales basis, Public segment net sales increased   8.9%  . Net sales to government customers increased   $155 million  , or   13.2%  , between periods.  Net sales in our state and local customer channel experienced strong growth as a continued focus on public safety and the addition of new contracts drove strong results. Net sales to federal government customers grew modestly compared to the prior year's strong results, as growth in software products was partially offset by declines in notebooks/mobile devices and storage-related products. Although we continued to benefit from the strategic changes made to better align with federal government purchasing programs for our federal customers, delivery of several larger transactional orders, including notebooks, will occur in the fourth quarter. Net sales to education customers increased   $175 million  , or   11.8%  , between periods, driven by growth in both our K-12 and higher education customer channels.

Growth in our K-12 customer channel was led by increases in notebooks/mobile devices, as a result of the implementation of projects related to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission E-Rate program and schools developing digital testing and curriculum programs. Additionally, we continued to see the benefit from programs pointed at select institutions in our higher education channel. Net sales to healthcare customers increased   $37 million  , or   3.0%  , between periods, as some customers began to implement projects that had been on hold due to consolidation activity in the healthcare industry. 
  Net sales in Other for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $505 million  , or   99.6%  , compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Other is comprised of CDW Canada and CDW UK. This increase was driven by the impact of consolidating   nine   months of CDW UK net sales. Net sales of CDW Canada were relatively flat for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation. CDW UK net sales were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation. 
   
  Gross profit 
  Gross profit increased   $191 million  , or   12.3%  , to   $1,749 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1,558 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of total net sales, gross profit   increased     40   basis points to   16.7%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , up from   16.3%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Our continuing mix into net service contract revenue, including items such as third-party services, warranties, software assurance and SaaS, contributed a positive impact of 30 basis points to gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction. We experienced a favorable impact of 40 basis points from vendor partner funding. Vendor partner funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising. These increases were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable product price/mix changes. 
  The gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors. 
   
  Selling and administrative expenses 
  Selling and administrative expenses   increased     $121 million  , or   13.7%  , to   $1,009 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $888 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of total net sales, selling and administrative expenses   increased     30   basis points to   9.6%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   up   from   9.3%   in the comparable prior year period. Sales payroll costs increased $68 million, or 16.6%, between years, primarily due to incremental coworkers hired since the   third   quarter of 2015, higher costs consistent with increased Net sales and Gross profit and the inclusion of CDW UK coworker costs. Total coworker count was   8,565  , up   296   from   8,269   at   September 30, 2015  . Total coworker count was 8,465 at   December 31, 2015  . Amortization expense related to intangibles increased   $15 million  , or   11.9%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period primarily due to incremental amortization expense related to the intangible assets arising from our acquisition of CDW UK. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense increased   $8 million  , or   40.6%  , during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period primarily due to annual equity awards granted under our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2016 and equity awards granted in connection with our acquisition of CDW UK.

           (1) 
    Segment income from operations includes the segment s direct operating income and allocations for Headquarters  costs, allocations for logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors. 
              (2)

     Income from operations was $  622 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $60 million  , or   10.6%  , compared to   $562 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Total operating margin percentage remained flat at   5.9%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  
  Corporate segment income from operations was   $391 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $10 million  , or   2.6%  , compared to   $382 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Corporate segment operating margin percentage   increased     10   basis points to   7.5%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   7.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit driven by a higher mix of net service contract revenue, as well as higher volume rebates, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, due to higher sales payroll costs. 
  Public segment income from operations was   $287 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $36 million  , or   14.5%  , compared to   $251 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Public segment operating margin percentage   increased     30   basis points to   6.7%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   6.4%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily driven by a higher mix of net service contract revenue and higher volume rebates, partially offset by unfavorable product price/mix changes.  
  Other income from operations was   $27 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $13 million  , or   93.1%  , compared to   $14 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of CDW UK income from operations. Other operating margin percentage decreased   10   basis points to   2.7%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   2.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .     This decrease was primarily due to an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, driven by higher intangibles amortization expense from our acquisition of CDW UK.

Interest expense, net 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding debt totaled   $3,241 million   compared to   $3,268 million   at   September 30, 2015  . Net interest expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $113 million  , a decrease of   $8 million   compared to   $121 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015   as a result of redemptions and refinancing activities completed during 2015. 
   
  Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt 
  For information regarding our debt, see Note 5 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there was a $2.1 million net loss on extinguishment of long-term debt, compared to   $24.3 million   recorded for the same period of 2015. Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows: 

(1) 
    We repaid all of the remaining aggregate principal amount outstanding. The loss recognized represents the difference between the aggregate principal amount and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs and premium. 
      
  Income tax expense 
  Income tax expense was   $188 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $191 million   for the same period of the prior year. The effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating the income tax expense as a percentage of Income before income taxes, was   37.0%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   37.9%   for the same period of the prior year and differed in both periods from the US federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we recorded a $1.2 million tax benefit upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, along with a $1.5 million deferred tax benefit as a result of a change in tax law that reduces the UK tax rate in a future period. For the same period of the prior year, we accrued $3.3 million of withholding tax on the unremitted earnings of our Canadian business as a result of no longer asserting these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations 
  We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   below.  
  Non-GAAP net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. Consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period. 
  Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. 
  We believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit

              (6) 
    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the aggregate adjustment for income taxes is based on applying a statutory effective tax rate of 36.0% to the amount of pre-tax adjustments.  In addition, the aggregate adjustment for income taxes includes $2.7 million of discrete tax benefits recorded in the quarter: $1.5 million related to the adjustment to the deferred tax liability for the acquired intangibles due to a future tax rate reduction in the UK, and $1.2 million for the stock compensation tax benefit related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the adjustment was based on a statutory effective tax rate of 38.0% (39.0% prior to the CDW UK acquisition), except for the non-cash equity-based compensation from our equity investment and the gain resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held 35% equity investment to fair value upon the completion of the acquisition of CDW UK, which were tax effected at a rate of 35.4%.

Seasonality 
  While we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year, sales in our Corporate segment, which primarily serves private sector business customers, are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year. Additionally, sales in our Public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
   
  Overview 
    
  We finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations. We also have   $802 million   of availability for borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and an additional  50 million     (  $65 million  ) under the CDW UK revolving credit facility. Our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments, which primarily include the purchase of inventory, payroll and general expenses. We also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy which includes investment for future growth, dividend payments, acquisitions and share repurchases. We believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available at least for the next year, however, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds. The amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions. 
    
  Debt Refinancing Activity 
    
  On August 17, 2016, we entered into a new seven-year $1,490.4 million aggregate principal amount senior secured term loan facility ("Term Loan"). The Term Loan was issued at a price that was 99.50% of par, which resulted in a discount of $7.4 million. Fees of $4.5 million were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the seven-year term on a straight-line basis. The Term Loan replaced the prior senior secured term loan facility that had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of $1,490.4 million. 
    
  On August 1, 2016, we entered into a new five-year  56 million ($72 million as of September 30, 2016) aggregate principal amount term loan facility ("CDW UK Term Loan"). The CDW UK Term Loan replaced the prior senior secured term loan facility (the  Prior CDW UK Term Loan Facility ) that had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of  56 million. In connection with this refinancing, the Prior CDW UK Term Loan Facility was amended to include both the CDW UK Term Loan and a  50 million revolving credit facility ("CDW UK Revolving Credit Facility"). The CDW UK Revolving Credit Facility replaced the prior  50 million revolving credit facility and expires on August 1, 2021.  
  For additional details regarding our debt and refinancing activities, refer to Note 5 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q and Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the December 31, 2015 financial statements.  
    
  Share Repurchase Program 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   8.4 million   shares of our common stock for   $355 million   under the previously announced   $500 million   share repurchase program. On May 4, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $750 million increase to our share repurchase program under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated or other transactions, depending on share price, market conditions and other factors. For more information on our share repurchase program, See Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.      
    
  Dividends 
    
  A summary of 2016 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows:

On   November 2, 2016  , we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of   $0.16   per common share. The dividend will be paid on   December 12, 2016   to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on   November 25, 2016  .  
   
  Cash Flows 
  Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows: 

Operating Activities        

(1) 
    Includes items such as Deferred income taxes, Depreciation and amortization, Equity-based compensation expense, Income from equity method investment and Net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt. 
       
           (2) 
    The change is primarily due to stronger operating results driven by Net sales growth and the impact of consolidating nine months of CDW UK financial results in 2016, compared to two months in 2015. 
       
           (3) 
    The change was primarily due to an increase in collections during 2016 due to the higher accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2015 driven by higher sales in our Public segment where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our Corporate segment. In addition, the lower accounts receivable balances as of December 31, 2014, driven by early payments from certain customers, resulted in lower cash flows in the prior year period. 
       
           (4) 
    The change was primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors during the current period and longer payment terms with certain vendors. 
       
           (5) 
    The change was primarily due to an increase in Deferred revenue and Miscellaneous receivables. 
       
  In order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs, we monitor our cash conversion cycle, defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average. Components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows: 
  
   47 

     Table of Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

(1) 
    Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Accounts receivable, net at the end of the period, divided by average daily net sales for the same three-month period. Also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables. 
              (2) 
    Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period.  
              (3) 
    Represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of Accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and Accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period.  
       
    The cash conversion cycle remained flat at   18   days at   September 30, 2016   and 2015. The increase in DSO was primarily due to higher net sales and receivables for third-party services such as software assurance and warranties. These services have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis. These services have a favorable impact on DPO as the payable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet without a corresponding Cost of sales in the Statement of Operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to Net sales. In addition, DPO also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms.  
   
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities decreased by   $265 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease in cash used is primarily due to the completion of our acquisition of CDW UK by purchasing the remaining 65% of its outstanding common stock on August 1, 2015. In addition, capital expenditures were   $41 million   and   $44 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and primarily related to improvements to our information technology systems during both periods.  
   
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities increased by   $141 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by share repurchases during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which resulted in an increase in cash used by financing activities of   $162 million  , partially offset by the changes in Accounts payable-inventory financing, which resulted in an increase in cash provided for financing activities of   $17 million  . For more information on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. In addition, an increase in dividends paid also contributed to the increase in cash used in financing activities. The increase in cash provided by Accounts payable-inventory financing was primarily driven by the increase in the accounts payable-inventory financing balance as of   September 30, 2016  , driven by a new vendor addition to our previously existing inventory financing agreement at December 31, 2015. For more information regarding our debt and refinancing activities, see Note 5 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had total indebtedness of   $3,241 million  , of which   $1,559 million   was secured indebtedness. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. The amount of CDW s restricted payment capacity under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility was   $680 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The amount of restricted payment capacity for the CDW UK Term Loan was   $120 million  .  
  For additional details regarding our debt and refinancing activities, refer to Note 5 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q and Note 8 (Long-Term Debt) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the December 31, 2015 financial statements.

  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  The information set forth in Note 7 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 "Financial Statements", of this Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
       
  See  Risk Factors  in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The disclosure below reflects an update to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  General economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Weak economic conditions generally, sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions, government spending cuts and the impact of new government programs, or a tightening of credit markets, could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. For example, there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the Referendum on the United Kingdom s ( UK ) Membership of the European Union ( EU ) (referred to as  Brexit ), advising for the exit of the UK from the EU. Potential adverse consequences of Brexit such as global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between UK and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The purpose of this Plan is to provide Coworkers of the Company and Participating Subsidiaries with an opportunity to purchase common stock of the Company through accumulated payroll deductions. It is the intention of the Company to have the Plan qualify as an  Employee Stock Purchase Plan  under Section 423 of the Code with respect to Offerings to Coworkers of the Company and its U.S. Subsidiaries. The provisions of the Plan, accordingly, shall be construed so as to extend and limit participation in Section 423 Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with the requirements of that Section of the Code.  The Plan, as amended and restated as set forth herein, shall apply to Offering Periods beginning on or after October 1, 2016.

To the extent permitted by Section 423 of the Code, the terms of each separate Section 423 Offering need not be identical, provided that the terms of the Plan and an Offering together satisfy Section 423 of the Code.

  3.   Eligibility  .  
  (a) Only Coworkers of the Company or a Participating Subsidiary shall be eligible to be granted Options under the Plan and, in no event may a Participant be granted an Option under the Plan following his or her Termination Date.  
  (b) Any provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no Coworker shall be granted an Option under the Plan if (i) immediately after the grant, such Coworker (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to such Coworker pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) would own capital stock of the Company and/or hold outstanding Options or options to purchase stock possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) such Option would permit his or her rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans (described in Section 423 of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to accrue at a rate that exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) of the Fair Market Value of such stock (determined at the time each  
  
   3 

such Option is granted) for each calendar year in which such Option is outstanding at any time.  For purposes of applying the limit described in clause (ii) above to a Participant in a Non-Section 423 Offering who is employed outside of the U.S., the exchange rate shall be determined on the last day of the applicable Offering Period.  No Participant may purchase more than 1,250 Shares during any Offering Period.   
  4.   Exercise of an Option  . Options shall be exercised on behalf of Participants in the Plan every Exercise Date, using payroll deductions that have accumulated in the Participants  Purchase Accounts during the immediately preceding Offering Period or that have been retained from a prior Offering Period pursuant to Section 8 hereof.  
  5.   Participation  .  
  (a) A Coworker shall be eligible to participate on the first Enrollment Date that occurs at least 90 days after such Coworker s first date of employment with the Company or a Participating Subsidiary; provided, that such Coworker properly completes and submits an election form by the deadline prescribed by the Company.  Participation in the Plan is voluntary. 
  (b) A Coworker who does not become a Participant on the first Enrollment Date on which he or she is eligible may thereafter become a Participant on any subsequent Enrollment Date by properly completing and submitting an election form by the deadline prescribed by the Company.  
  (c) Payroll deductions for a Participant shall commence on the first payroll date following the Enrollment Date and shall end on the last payroll date in the Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 12 hereof.  
  6.   Payroll Deductions  .  
  (a) A Participant shall elect to have payroll deductions made during an Offering Period equal to no less than 1% of the Participant s Compensation up to a maximum of 15% (or such greater amount as the Committee establishes from time to time). The amount of such payroll deductions shall be in whole percentages (for example, 3%, 12%, 15%). All payroll deductions made by a Participant shall be credited to his or her Purchase Account. A Participant may not make any additional payments into his or her Purchase Account.  All such payroll deductions shall be made from the Participant s Compensation after deduction of any tax, social security and national insurance contributions. 
  (b) A Participant may not increase or decrease the rate of payroll deductions during an Offering Period.  A Participant may change his or her payroll deduction percentage under subsection (a) above for any subsequent Offering Period by properly completing and submitting an election change form in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Committee. The change in amount shall be effective as of the first Enrollment Date following the date of filing of the election change form.  
  
   4 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) hereof, a Participant s payroll deductions may be decreased to zero percent (0%) at any time during an Offering Period. Payroll deductions shall recommence at the rate provided in such Participant s election form at the beginning of the first Offering Period which is scheduled to end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 12 hereof.  
  7.   Grant of Option  . On the applicable Enrollment Date, each Participant in an Offering Period shall be granted an Option to purchase on the next following Exercise Date a number of full Shares determined by dividing such Participant s payroll deductions accumulated prior to such Exercise Date and retained in the Participant s Purchase Account as of the Exercise Date by the applicable Purchase Price.  
  8.   Exercise of Option  . A Participant s Option for the purchase of Shares shall be exercised automatically on the Exercise Date, and the maximum number of Shares subject to the Option shall be purchased for such Participant at the applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated payroll deductions in his or her Purchase Account. No fractional Shares shall be purchased; any payroll deductions accumulated in a Participant s Purchase Account which are not sufficient to purchase a full Share shall be retained in the Purchase Account for the next subsequent Offering Period, subject to earlier withdrawal by the Participant as provided in Section 12 hereof. All other payroll deductions accumulated in a Participant s Purchase Account and not used to purchase Shares on an Exercise Date shall be distributed to the Participant. During a Participant s lifetime, a Participant s Option is exercisable only by him or her. The Company shall satisfy the exercise of all Participants  Options for the purchase of Shares through (a) the issuance of authorized but unissued Shares, (b) the transfer of treasury Shares, (c) the purchase of Shares on behalf of the applicable Participants on the open market through an independent broker and/or (d) a combination of the foregoing.  
  9.    Issuance of Stock  .  The Shares purchased by each Participant shall be issued in book entry form and shall be considered to be issued and outstanding to such Participant s credit as of the end of the last day of each Offering Period.  The Committee may permit or require that shares be deposited directly in a Brokerage Account with one or more brokers designated by the Committee or to one or more designated agents of the Company, and the Committee may use electronic or automated methods of share transfer.  The Committee may require that Shares be retained with such brokers or agents for a designated period of time and/or may establish other procedures to permit tracking of disqualifying dispositions of such shares, and may also impose a transaction fee with respect to a sale of Shares issued to a Participant s credit and held by such a broker or agent.  The Committee may permit Shares purchased under the Plan to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan or program maintained by the Company, and establish a default method for the payment of dividends. 
  10.   Approval by Stockholders  . Notwithstanding the above, the Plan was expressly made subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company within 12 months before or after the date the Plan was adopted by the Board, and such stockholder approval was obtained in the manner and to the degree required under applicable federal and state law.

11.   Administration  .  
  (a)   Powers and Duties of the Committee  . The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, Section 423 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, the Committee shall have the discretionary authority to determine the time and frequency of granting Options, the terms and conditions of the Options and the number of Shares subject to each Option. The Committee shall also have the discretionary authority to do everything necessary and appropriate to administer the Plan, including, without limitation, interpreting the provisions of the Plan (but any such interpretation shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of Section 423 of the Code).  The Committee may delegate its duties and authority to any of the Company s officers or employees as it determines to be appropriate.  All actions, decisions and determinations of, and interpretations by the Committee or its delegate with respect to the Plan shall be final and binding upon all Participants and upon their executors, administrators, personal representatives, heirs and legatees. No member of the Board of Directors or the Committee and no officer or director to whom the Committee has delegated its duties and authority shall be liable for any action, decision, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Option granted hereunder. Each Section 423 Offering shall be administered so as to ensure that all Participants have the same rights and privileges as are provided by Section 423(b)(5) of the Code.  
  (b)   Administrator  . The Company, Board or the Committee may engage the services of a brokerage firm or financial institution (the  Administrator ) to perform certain ministerial and procedural duties under the Plan including, but not limited to, mailing and receiving notices contemplated under the Plan, determining the number of Purchased Shares for each Participant, maintaining or causing to be maintained the Purchase Account and the Brokerage Account, disbursing funds maintained in the Purchase Account or proceeds from the sale of Shares through the Brokerage Account, and filing with the appropriate tax authorities proper tax returns and forms (including information returns) and providing to each Participant statements as required by law or regulation.  
  (c)   Indemnification  . Each person who is or shall have been (a) a member of the Board, (b) a member of the Committee, or (c) an officer or employee of the Company to whom authority was delegated in relation to this Plan, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company s approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding against him or her; provided, however, that he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability or expense is a result of his or her own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute.  
  
   6 

The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any contract with the Company, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or of any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.  
  12.   Withdrawal  . A Participant may withdraw from the Plan by properly completing and submitting to the Company a withdrawal form in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Committee, which must be submitted prior to the date specified by the Committee before the last day of the applicable Offering Period. Upon withdrawal, any payroll deductions credited to the Participant s Purchase Account prior to the effective date of the Participant s withdrawal from the Plan will be returned to the Participant. No further payroll deductions for the purchase of Shares will be made during subsequent Offering Periods, unless the Participant properly completes and submits an election form, by the deadline prescribed by the Company. A Participant s withdrawal from an offering will not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in the Plan or in any similar plan that may hereafter be adopted by the Company.  
  13.   Termination of Employment  . On the Termination Date of a Participant for any reason prior to the applicable Exercise Date, whether voluntary or involuntary, and including termination of employment due to retirement, death or as a result of liquidation, dissolution, sale, merger or a similar event affecting the Company or a Participating Subsidiary, the corresponding payroll deductions credited to his or her Purchase Account will be returned to him or her or, in the case of the Participant s death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 16, and his or her Option will be automatically terminated.  
  14.   Interest  . No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions of a Participant in the Plan.  
  15.   Stock  .  
  (a) The stock subject to Options shall be common stock of the Company as traded on the NASDAQ or on such other exchange as the Shares may be listed.  
  (b) Subject to adjustment upon changes in capitalization of the Company as provided in Section 18 hereof, the maximum number of Shares which shall be made available for sale under the Plan shall be 1,700,000 Shares. If, on a given Exercise Date, the number of Shares with respect to which Options are to be exercised exceeds the number of Shares then available under the Plan, the Committee shall make a pro rata allocation of the Shares remaining available for purchase in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable.  
  (c) A Participant shall have no interest or voting right in Shares covered by his or her Option until such Option has been exercised and the Participant has become a holder of record of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise.  
  16.   Designation of Beneficiary  . To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may permit Participants to designate beneficiaries to receive any Purchased Shares or payroll deductions, if any, in the Participant s accounts under the Plan in the event of such Participant s death. Beneficiary designations shall be made in accordance with procedures prescribed by the  
  
   7 

Committee. If no properly designated beneficiary survives the Participant, the Purchased Shares and payroll deductions, if any, will be distributed to the Participant s estate.  
  17.   Assignability of Options  . Neither payroll deductions credited to a Participant s Purchase Account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an Option or to receive Shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as provided in Section 16 hereof) by the Participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw from an Offering Period in accordance with Section 12 hereof.  
  
   8 

18.   Adjustment of Number of Shares Subject to Options  .  
  (a)   Adjustment  . Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the maximum number of securities available for purchase under the Plan, as well as the price per security and the number of securities covered by each Option under the Plan which has not yet been exercised shall be appropriately adjusted in the event of any a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the common stock of the Company, or any other increase or decrease in the number of Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been  effected without receipt of consideration.  Such adjustment shall be made by the Board or the Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. If any such adjustment would result in a fractional security being available under the Plan, such fractional security shall be disregarded. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Option. The Options granted pursuant to a Section 423 Offering shall not be adjusted in a manner that causes the Options to fail to qualify as options issued pursuant to an  employee stock purchase plan  within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code.  
  (b)   Dissolution or Liquidation  . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Offering Period then in progress will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board, and the Board may either provide for the purchase of Shares as of the date on which such Offering Period terminates or return to each Participant the payroll deductions credited to such Participant s Purchase Account. 
   (c)   Merger or Asset Sale  . In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each outstanding Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation, unless the Board determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion, that in lieu of such assumption or substitution to either terminate all outstanding Options and return to each Participant the payroll deductions credited to such Participant s Purchase Account or to provide for the Offering Period in progress to end on a date prior to the consummation of such sale or merger.  
  19.   Amendments or Termination of the Plan  .  
  (a) The Board of Directors or the Committee may at any time and for any reason amend, modify, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan without notice; provided that no Participant s existing rights in respect of existing Options are adversely affected thereby. To the extent necessary to comply with Section 423 of the Code (or any other applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule), the Company shall obtain stockholder approval in such a manner and to such a degree as required.  
  
   9 

(b) Without stockholder consent and without regard to whether any Participant rights may be considered to have been  adversely affected,  the Board or the Committee shall be entitled to change the Purchase Price, Offering Periods, limit or increase the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount withheld during an Offering Period, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts withheld in a currency other than U.S. dollars, permit payroll withholding in an amount less than or greater than the amount designated by a Participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Company s processing of properly completed withholding elections, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of Shares for each Participant properly correspond with amounts withheld from the Participant s Compensation, and establish such other limitations or procedures as the Board or the Committee determines in its sole discretion advisable which are consistent with the Plan; provided, however, that changes to (i) the Purchase Price, (ii) the Offering Period, (iii) the maximum percentage of Compensation that may be deducted pursuant to Section 6(a) or (iv) the maximum number of Shares that may be purchased in an Offering Period, shall not be effective until communicated to Participants in a reasonable manner, with the determination of such reasonable manner in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee.  
  20.   No Other Obligations  . The receipt of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall impose no obligation upon the Participant to purchase any Shares covered by such Option. Nor shall the granting of an Option pursuant to the Plan constitute an agreement or an understanding, express or implied, on the part of the Company to employ the Participant for any specified period.  
  21.   Notices and Communication  . Any notice or other form of communication which the Company or a Participant may be required or permitted to give to the other shall be provided through such means as designated by the Committee, including but not limited to any paper or electronic method.  
  22.   Condition Upon Issuance of Shares  .  
  (a) Shares shall not be issued with respect to an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.  
  (b) As a condition to the exercise of an Option, the Company may require the person exercising such Option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned applicable provisions of law.  
  23.   General Compliance  . The Plan will be administered and Options will be exercised in compliance with the 1933 Act, 1934 Act and all other applicable securities laws and Company policies, including without limitation, any insider trading policy of the Company.  
  
   10 

24.   Term of the Plan  . The Plan became effective upon the earlier to occur of its adoption by the Board of Directors or its approval by the stockholders of the Company and shall continue in effect until terminated pursuant to Section 19.

  I, Thomas E. Richards, certify that:

    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of the registrant; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
