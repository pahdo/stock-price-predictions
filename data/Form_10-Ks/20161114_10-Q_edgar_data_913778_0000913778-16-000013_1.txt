  NOTE A - ORGANIZATION 
 
  Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund IV L.P. (the "Fund") was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware as of October 5, 1993, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating partnerships which will acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly constructed, existing or rehabilitated low-income apartment complexes ("Operating Partnerships"). Effective as of June 1, 2001 there was a restructuring and, as a result, the Fund's general partner was reorganized as follows.  The general partner of the Fund continues to be Boston Capital Associates IV L.P., a Delaware limited partnership.  The general partner of the general partner of the Fund is BCA Associates Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership, whose sole general partner is C M Management, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation and whose limited partners are Herbert F. Collins and John P. Manning.  Mr. Manning is the principal of Boston Capital Partners, Inc.  The limited partner of the general partner of the Fund is Capital Investment Holdings, a general partnership whose partners are various officers and employees of Boston Capital Partners, Inc. and its affiliates.  The assignor limited partner is BCTC IV Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation which is now wholly-owned by John P. Manning.  
 
 Pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, the Fund filed a Form S-11 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, effective December 16, 1993, which covered the offering (the "Public Offering") of the Fund's beneficial assignee certificates ("BACs") representing assignments of units of the beneficial interest of the limited partnership interest of the assignor limited partner.  The Fund registered 30,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC for sale to the public in one or more series.  On April 18, 1996, an amendment to Form S-11 which registered an additional 10,000,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective.  On April 2, 1998, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 25,000,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series, became effective.  On August 31, 1999, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,000,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series, became effective.  On July 26, 2000, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 7,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series, became effective.  On July 24, 2001, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 7,000,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series, became effective.  On July 24, 2002, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 7,000,000 BACs for sale to the public, became effective. On July 1, 2003, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 7,000,000 BACs for sale to the public, became effective.

  The condensed financial statements herein as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and six months then ended have been prepared by the Fund, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 The Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and include adjustments in interim periods considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations.

  NOTE E - TAXABLE LOSS 
 
  The Fund's taxable loss for calendar year ended December 31, 2016 is expected to differ from its loss for financial reporting purposes.  This is primarily due to accounting differences in depreciation incurred by the Operating Partnerships and also differences between the equity method of accounting and the IRS accounting methods.   
   
  NOTE F - INCOME TAXES 
   
  The Fund has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.  Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns.  The Fund's federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a partnership.  Accordingly, the Fund is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.  The Fund is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.  Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Fund has no other tax positions, which must be considered for disclosure.  Income tax returns filed by the Fund are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years. While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax years since 2012 remain open. 
    
 NOTE G - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
    
 Events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were available to be issued must be evaluated for recognition or disclosure.  The effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date are recognized in the accompanying financial statements.   Subsequent events, which provide evidence about conditions that existed after the balance sheet date, require disclosure in the accompanying notes.  Management evaluated the activity of the Fund through the date the financial statements were issued, and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. 

Item 2.   Management ' s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations 
   
 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements including our intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, strategies and predictions of our future activities, or other future events or conditions. These statements are  forward looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by these acts. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including, for example, the factors identified in Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. 
    
 Liquidity 
 
  The Fund's primary source of funds was the proceeds of its Public Offering.  Other sources of liquidity include (i) interest earned on capital contributions unpaid for the six months ended September 30, 2016 or on working capital reserves, (ii) cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund has invested and (iii) proceeds received from the dispositions of the Operating Partnership that are returned to fund reserves.  These sources of liquidity, along with the Fund's working capital reserve, are available to meet the obligations of the Partnership.  The Fund does not anticipate significant cash distributions from operations of the Operating Partnerships. 
   
 The Fund is currently accruing the fund management fee.  Fund management fees accrued during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were $756,879 and total fund management fees accrued as of September 30, 2016 were $40,870,711. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, $9,402,248 of the accrued fund management fees were paid. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, these liabilities will be deferred until the Fund receives proceeds from sales of the Operating Partnerships that will be used to satisfy these liabilities.  The Fund's working capital and sources of liquidity coupled with affiliated party liability accruals allow sufficient levels of liquidity to meet the third party obligations of the Fund.  The Fund is currently unaware of any trends that would create insufficient liquidity to meet future third party obligations of the Fund. 

Liquidity (continued)  
 
 As of September 30, 2016, an affiliate of the general partner of the Fund advanced a total of $598,050 to the Fund to pay some operating expenses of the Fund, and to make advances and/or loans to Operating Partnerships. These advances are included in Accounts payable affiliates. During the six months ended September 30, 2016, $14,135 was advanced to the Fund from an affiliate of the general partner.  The advances made in the six months ended, as well as the total advances made as of September 30, 2016, are as follows: 

All payables to affiliates will be paid, without interest, from available cash flow or the proceeds of sales or refinancing of the Fund's interests in Operating Partnerships.

Results of Operations 
 
  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Fund held limited partnership interests in 236 and 277 Operating Partnerships, respectively.  In each instance the apartment complex owned by the applicable Operating Partnership is eligible for the federal housing tax credit.  Initial occupancy of a unit in each apartment complex which complied with the minimum set-aside test (i.e., initial occupancy by tenants with incomes equal to no more than a certain percentage of area median income) and the rent restriction test (i.e., gross rent charged tenants does not exceed 30% of the applicable income standards) is referred to as "Qualified Occupancy."  Each of the Operating Partnerships and each of the respective apartment complexes are described more fully in the Prospectus or applicable report on Form 8-K.  The general partner of the Fund believes that there is adequate casualty insurance on the properties. 
   
 The Fund incurred a fund management fee to Boston Capital Asset Management Limited Partnership in an amount equal to .5 percent of the aggregate cost of the apartment complexes owned by the Operating Partnerships, less the amount of various asset management and reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships. The fund management fees net of reporting fees incurred and the reporting fees paid by the Operating Partnerships for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, are as follows:  

The Fund's investment objectives do not include receipt of significant cash distributions from the Operating Partnerships in which it has invested or intends to invest.  The Fund's investments in Operating Partnerships have been and will be made principally with a view towards realization of federal housing tax credits for allocation to its partners and BAC holders.  
 
 Series 20 
 
  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the average Qualified Occupancy for the series was 100%.  The series had a total of 3 properties at September 30, 2016, all of which were at 100% Qualified Occupancy. 
 
  For the six month periods  ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Series 20 reflects a net loss from Operating Partnerships of $(27,363) and $(21,410), respectively, which includes depreciation and amortization of $86,616 and $101,632, respectively.

 In March 2016, the operating general partner of Franklinton Elderly Housing entered into an agreement to sell the property to a non-affiliated entity and the transaction closed on June 14, 2016.  The sales price of the property was $1,655,869, which included the outstanding mortgage balance of approximately $1,514,869 and cash proceeds to the investment partnership of $141,000.  Of the total proceeds received by the investment partnership, $3,000 will be paid to BCAMLP for expenses related to the sale, which include third party legal costs.  The remaining proceeds from the sale of $138,000 were returned to cash reserves held by Series 20.

  Lombard Partners, LP (Lombard Heights Apts.) was a 24-unit family property located in Springfield, Missouri.  It was sold at a foreclosure sale on July 31, 2008.  As a result of the foreclosure, the operating partnership lost remaining credits of $47,840 and experienced recapture and interest penalties of $199,516.  This represented a loss of tax credits, and recapture and interest penalties of $12 and $49, respectively, per 1,000 BACs.  Following the foreclosure sale, the investment general partner pursued legal action against the operating general partner and guarantors in an effort to recover a portion of the lost tax credits, recapture costs and interest penalties.  Counsel for the investment general partner initially needed to resolve jurisdictional issues which ultimately allowed pursuit of the guarantors in Massachusetts.  After much legal maneuvering in 2009 thru early 2011, a Massachusetts court approved a damages judgment of $389,043, plus legal costs and interest of $29,726.       
   
 As a follow up to the judgment rendered by the Massachusetts court, counsel for the investment general partner filed a motion  in aid of judgment  in mid-April 2011 requesting that the court authorize him to depose the defendants regarding their current financial situation and their ability to pay the aforementioned judgment.  In late December 2011, the attorney for the operating general partner and the guarantors filed a motion to quash the aforementioned deposition.  This motion was subsequently withdrawn by the attorney for the guarantors on January 12, 2012.  On February 28, 2012, new counsel for the operating general partner filed a motion in Missouri to quash the deposition and to stay enforcement of the Massachusetts judgment.  On March 1, 2012, the Missouri Court approved the aforementioned motion.  This remanded the case back to the Massachusetts court to correct the original judgment.  On May 21, 2012, the Massachusetts court denied the operating general partner's motion for relief from judgment and amended the judgment previously entered.  At the end of the second quarter of 2012, counsel for the investment general partner was notified by counsel for the operating general partner that it intends to file an appeal of the May 21, 2012 ruling.  On June 20, 2012, the Missouri court lifted its stay and authorized commencement of post-judgment discovery.   
   
 Counsel for the investment general partner took a deposition from the operating general partner on August 8, 2012 in an effort to ascertain whether the operating general partner had the financial capacity to pay the judgment and penalties that had been awarded.  Based on information revealed during the deposition, it appeared that the operating general partner had been depleting its assets via transfers of assets to various family members.  Counsel for the investment general partner filed a petition in Missouri Circuit Court on October 30, 2012 arguing that the aforementioned asset transfers were fraudulent, notifying the transferees that the assets they received from the guarantors were transferred to them fraudulently, and requesting that the subject transfers be voided.  In late December 2012, the guarantors filed a motion with the court denying that the conveyance of assets was fraudulent.  Counsel for the investment general partner responded in early January 2013 by requesting documentation on the asset transfers and explanations from the guarantors as to why the transfers were not fraudulent in nature under the Missouri Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act.  The defendant filed an appeal of the judgment in Massachusetts Court on January 22, 2013.  On March 7, 2013, counsel for the investment general partner filed its appeal brief with the Massachusetts Court.  The Appellate Court Hearing was held on September 17, 2013.  On February 27, 2014, the Appellate Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff (i.e. the investment limited partner) and re-affirmed the March 30, 2011 judgment.  With this favorable ruling from the Massachusetts appellate judge counsel for the plaintiff filed a motion in Missouri Court in October 2014 to record the aforementioned judgment and lift the stay.  On January 6, 2015, the defendant's counsel confirmed that it was not contesting the judgment and motion to lift the stay.  Consequently, the judgement and order to lift the stay were finally approved by the Missouri Court in late February 2015.  As a result, the defendant began to provide piecemeal information on its current financial situation to the investment general partner in March and April 2015.  This led the investment general partner to conclude that the guarantor had the financial wherewithal to pay some portion of the judgement amount.  In mid-July 2015, the Missouri court issued an ordered for non-binding mediation to both the plaintiff and the defendant.  The mediation conference took place on September 10, 2015 and a settlement was agreed to at $275,000.  Full payment of the settlement amount by the defendant was completed in January 2016 to conclude this matter.

 Baldwin Villas Limited Partnership (Baldwin Villas) is a 65-unit property located in Pontiac, MI.  This partnership has operated with significant operating deficits for several years due to a lack of rent growth, high operating expenses and high debt service payments.  As a result of the ongoing deficits, the partnership has high accounts payable and deferred maintenance issues, is severely delinquent on its real estate tax payments, and was in monetary default of its mortgage payments.  On August 30, 2011, Baldwin Villas entered into a settlement agreement (the  First Settlement Agreement ) with the lender resulting in a new mortgage note (the  New Note ) being executed that was guaranteed by the operating general partner and its principals.  The Operating Partnership did not make all required payments and was in default under the First Settlement Agreement and New Note.  On December 31, 2014, the Operating Partnership entered into a second settlement agreement (the  Second Settlement Agreement ) with the lender.  Under terms of the Second Settlement Agreement, the total indebtedness due to the lender, $5,113,317, was bifurcated into two promissory notes, one named the MHT Note for $1,950,000 and one named the Deficiency Note for $3,163,317.  The MHT note was purchased by MHT Housing, Inc., an affiliate of the operating general partner, for its face amount, $1,950,000, at the time of closing on the Second Settlement Agreement.  Certain loan and title documents were assigned to MHT Housing, Inc., including a  confession judgment  issued by the Circuit Court of Oakland County, MI, which would have allowed the lender after a default of the First Settlement Agreement to immediately appoint a receiver who would have had the authority to sell the property.  Also, the lender agreed to accept $1,950,000 as full payment over time for the Deficiency Note as long as required interest and quarterly principal payments are made when due.  The principals of the operating general partner pledged their economic interests in several real estate partnerships to the lender as security for the Deficiency Note. Furthermore, in the case of a default under the Deficiency Note, the lender still retains its rights including the pursuit of a foreclosure action.  The Second Settlement agreement was executed without the knowledge or consent of the investment general partner.  On December 29, 2015, MHT Housing IV, Inc. purchased the Deficiency Note.  MHT Housing IV, Inc. is also an affiliate of the operating general partner. 
   
 From inception through September 30, 2016, the operating general partner has provided operating deficit advances to Baldwin Villas totaling approximately $1,581,000.  The investment general partner continues to press the operating general partner to provide operating deficit advances to:  1) pay the mortgage obligations agreed to in the Second Settlement Agreement and real estate tax deficiencies, 2) pay down growing vendor payables, and 3) fund deferred maintenance and unit turn costs.  For several quarters the operating general partner has been discussing a house by house sales program that would be executed in coordination with a nonprofit affordable housing organization and the lender in an effort to maximize net sale proceeds to pay off the Deficiency Note; all sales would be to qualified low-income homebuyers in order to avoid recapture costs for the investment limited partner.  As of the end of the third quarter of 2016, this sales program had not yet commenced.  In light of the amount of mortgage debt, the amount of operating deficit advances by the operating general partner over the years, and the fact that the 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period for Baldwin Villas expired on December 31, 2015, the investment general partner concluded that the investment limited partner's interest in Baldwin Villas had no value.  As a result, it agreed in the second quarter of 2016 to transfer the investment limited partner's interest in Baldwin Villas to an affiliate of the operating general partner for $1.  The subject transfer is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2016.

  Baldwin Villas Limited Partnership (Baldwin Villas) is a 65-unit property located in Pontiac, MI.  This partnership has operated with significant operating deficits for several years due to a lack of rent growth, high operating expenses and high debt service payments.  As a result of the ongoing deficits, the partnership has high accounts payable and deferred maintenance issues, is severely delinquent on its real estate tax payments, and was in monetary default of its mortgage payments.  On August 30, 2011, Baldwin Villas entered into a settlement agreement (the  First Settlement Agreement ) with the lender resulting in a new mortgage note (the  New Note ) being executed that was guaranteed by the operating general partner and its principals.  The Operating Partnership did not make all required payments and was in default under the First Settlement Agreement and New Note.  On December 31, 2014, the Operating Partnership entered into a second settlement agreement (the  Second Settlement Agreement ) with the lender.  Under terms of the Second Settlement Agreement, the total indebtedness due to the lender, $5,113,317, was bifurcated into two promissory notes, one named the MHT Note for $1,950,000 and one named the Deficiency Note for $3,163,317.  The MHT note was purchased by MHT Housing, Inc., an affiliate of the operating general partner, for its face amount, $1,950,000, at the time of closing on the Second Settlement Agreement.  Certain loan and title documents were assigned to MHT Housing, Inc., including a  confession judgment  issued by the Circuit Court of Oakland County, MI, which would have allowed the lender after a default of the First Settlement Agreement to immediately appoint a receiver who would have had the authority to sell the property.  Also, the lender agreed to accept $1,950,000 as full payment over time for the Deficiency Note as long as required interest and quarterly principal payments are made when due.  The principals of the operating general partner pledged their economic interests in several real estate partnerships to the lender as security for the Deficiency Note.  Furthermore, in the case of a default under the Deficiency Note, the lender still retains its rights including the pursuit of a foreclosure action.  The Second Settlement agreement was executed without the knowledge or consent of the investment general partner.  On December 29, 2015, MHT Housing IV, Inc. purchased the Deficiency Note.  MHT Housing IV, Inc. is also an affiliate of the operating general partner. 
   
 From inception through September 30, 2016, the operating general partner has provided operating deficit advances to Baldwin Villas totaling approximately $1,581,000.  The investment general partner continues to press the operating general partner to provide operating deficit advances to:  1) pay the mortgage obligations agreed to in the Second Settlement Agreement and real estate tax deficiencies, 2) pay down growing vendor payables, and 3) fund deferred maintenance and unit turn costs.  For several quarters the operating general partner has been discussing a house by house sales program that would be executed in coordination with a nonprofit affordable housing organization and the lender in an effort to maximize net sale proceeds to pay off the Deficiency Note; all sales would be to qualified low-income homebuyers in order to avoid recapture costs for the investment limited partner.  As of the end of the third quarter of 2016, this sales program had not yet commenced.  In light of the amount of mortgage debt, the amount of operating deficit advances by the operating general partner over the years, and the fact that the 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period for Baldwin Villas expired on December 31, 2015, the investment general partner concluded that the investment limited partner's interest in Baldwin Villas had no value.  As a result, it agreed in the second quarter of 2016 to transfer the investment limited partner's interest in Baldwin Villas to an affiliate of the investment general partner for $1.  The subject transfer is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2016.

 Parkside Plaza, LP 
    
 Series 44 
 
  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the average Qualified Occupancy was 100%.  The series had a total of 7 properties at September 30, 2016, all of which were at 100% Qualified Occupancy. 
   
 For the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Series 44 reflects a net loss from Operating Partnerships of $(96,020) and $(205,517), respectively, which includes depreciation and amortization of $727,408 and $770,821, respectively.  This is an interim period estimate; it is not indicative of the final year-end results. 
   
 Brookside Park Limited Partnership (Brookside Park Apartments) is a 200-unit family property located in Atlanta, Georgia.  This property operated below breakeven each year from 2007 thru 2013.  During this period of time the investment general partner worked with the operating general partner in an effort to improve operations and mitigate operating deficits.  Despite the operating deficit guaranty having expired at the end of June 2011, the operating general partner and guarantor continued to fund deficits through November 2012 while it attempted to negotiate a mortgage bond re-structure with the servicer for the bonds (the  Servicer ).  These negotiations were unsuccessful and, as a result, the operating general partner stopped funding deficits, a mortgage payment default occurred in January 2013, and a default notice was issued by the Servicer on January 14, 2013.  After the default, the investment general partner and the State Tax Credit Syndicator negotiated an agreement with the Servicer, eventually executed on June 28, 2013, whereby the investment general partner and the State Tax Credit Syndicator cured the payment default and agreed to fund deficits while the operating partnership tried to refinance the mortgage bonds at a lower interest rate.  In exchange, the Servicer agreed to permit a refinancing of the mortgage bonds by waiving the lockout on early bond redemption and not assessing any pre-payment or yield maintenance penalties if the re-financing could be completed before the end of the first quarter of 2014.  The refinancing effort was unsuccessful for a number of reasons most importantly due to rising interest rates in the second half of 2013 with new loan proceeds falling $1,400,000 to $1,600,000 short of what was needed to redeem the mortgage bonds at par and to pay all costs of the refinancing.  Since there was no source of additional capital for this financing gap, this led to a payment default in January 2014 when the investment general partner and the State Tax Credit Syndicator suspended deficit funding, an immediate foreclosure action by the Servicer, and a foreclosure sale on March 4, 2014.  As a result, the investment limited partner lost future tax credits of $27,710, and incurred recapture and interest penalty costs of $59,646, equivalent to approximately $10 and $22 per 1,000 BACs respectively.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the investment limited partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting, had previously reduced the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.  Accordingly, no gain on the sale of the Operating Partnership has been recorded.  Note that the low income housing tax credit compliance period for Brookside Park Limited Partnership would not have expired until December 31, 2019.    
   
 United Development CO. 2001 LP (Memphis 102) is a 102-unit single family home scattered site development, located in Memphis, TN.  In September 2013, the court-appointed receiver for the Operating Partnership entered into an agreement to sell the property to a third-party buyer for $1,173,000; the sale transaction closed on November 26, 2013.  After payment of the outstanding real estate taxes, the remaining proceeds of $210,000 were paid to the first mortgage lender.  There were no cash proceeds to the investment partnership.  The buyer agreed to operate the property in accordance with the land use and regulatory agreement as well as Section 42 of the Tax Code; therefore, resulting in no tax credit recapture or interest penalties for the investment limited partner stemming from the sale.  The investment limited partners will; however, lose federal tax credits in 2013 and 2014 totaling $30,660 and $131,253, respectively, in addition to the recapture in 2012 totaling $281,707, equivalent to $104 per 1,000 BACs.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the investment limited partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting, had previously reduced the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.  Accordingly, no gain on the sale of the Operating Partnership has been recorded.  Despite the sale of the property, the low income housing tax credit compliance period for the tax credits received remains unchanged and will expire on December 31, 2018.    
   
 United Development Limited Partnership 2001 (Families First II) is a 66-unit single family house development located in West Memphis, AR.  Due to low occupancy, deferred maintenance, high operating expenses and high debt service, the partnership operates below breakeven.  The operating general partner, whose operating deficit guarantee has expired, provides limited oversight of property operations.  For the most part, it has been the third party property management company and the investment general partner who have directed property operations since January 2014.  Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 and continuing through October 23, 2015, the investment limited partner had advanced $201,849 from fund reserves to Families First II to finance operating deficits.  No further advances were made by the investment limited partner through the remainder of the fourth quarter of 2015 or during the first half of 2016.  Starting in November 2015, mortgage payments were not made by the Operating Partnership.  As a result, the lender issued a default notice on December 8, 2015, and accelerated payment of the mortgage note.  On February 10, 2016 the court appointed a receiver to manage the property.  The foreclosure on the property occurred on July 21, 2016.  The tax credit recapture costs and interest penalties as a result of the foreclosure sale is estimated at $772,789.  This is equivalent to recapture costs and interest penalties of $286 per 1,000 BACs.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the investment limited partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting, had previously reduced the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.  Accordingly, no gain on the foreclosure of the Operating Partnership has been recorded.  Note that the 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period for Families First II would have expired on December 31, 2018.

This is an interim period estimate; it is not indicative of the final year-end results. 
   
 Baldwin Villas Limited Partnership (Baldwin Villas) is a 65-unit property located in Pontiac, MI.  This partnership has operated with significant operating deficits for several years due to a lack of rent growth, high operating expenses and high debt service payments.  As a result of the ongoing deficits, the partnership has high accounts payable and deferred maintenance issues, is severely delinquent on its real estate tax payments, and was in monetary default of its mortgage payments.  On August 30, 2011, Baldwin Villas entered into a settlement agreement (the  First Settlement Agreement ) with the lender resulting in a new mortgage note (the  New Note ) being executed that was guaranteed by the operating general partner and its principals.  The Operating Partnership did not make all required payments and was in default under the First Settlement Agreement and New Note.  On December 31, 2014, the Operating Partnership entered into a second settlement agreement (the  Second Settlement Agreement ) with the lender.  Under terms of the Second Settlement Agreement, the total indebtedness due to the lender, $5,113,317, was bifurcated into two promissory notes, one named the MHT Note for $1,950,000 and one named the Deficiency Note for $3,163,317.  The MHT note was purchased by MHT Housing, Inc., an affiliate of the operating general partner, for its face amount, $1,950,000, at the time of closing on the Second Settlement Agreement.  Certain loan and title documents were assigned to MHT Housing, Inc., including a  confession judgment  issued by the Circuit Court of Oakland County, MI, which would have allowed the lender after a default of the First Settlement Agreement to immediately appoint a receiver who would have had the authority to sell the property.  Also, the lender agreed to accept $1,950,000 as full payment over time for the Deficiency Note as long as required interest and quarterly principal payments are made when due.  The principals of the operating general partner pledged their economic interests in several real estate partnerships to the lender as security for the Deficiency Note.  Furthermore, in the case of a default under the Deficiency Note, the lender still retains its rights including the pursuit of a foreclosure action.  The Second Settlement agreement was executed without the knowledge or consent of the investment general partner.  On December 29, 2015, MHT Housing IV, Inc. purchased the Deficiency Note.  MHT Housing IV, Inc. is also an affiliate of the operating general partner. 
   
 From inception through September 30, 2016, the operating general partner has provided operating deficit advances to Baldwin Villas totaling approximately $1,581,000.  The investment general partner continues to press the operating general partner to provide operating deficit advances to:  1) pay the mortgage obligations agreed to in the Second Settlement Agreement and real estate tax deficiencies, 2) pay down growing vendor payables, and 3) fund deferred maintenance and unit turn costs.  For several quarters the operating general partner has been discussing a house by house sales program that would be executed in coordination with a nonprofit affordable housing organization and the lender in an effort to maximize net sale proceeds to pay off the Deficiency Note; all sales would be to qualified low-income homebuyers in order to avoid recapture costs for the investment limited partner.  As of the end of the third quarter of 2016, this sales program had not yet commenced.  In light of the amount of mortgage debt, the amount of operating deficit advances by the operating general partner over the years, and the fact that the 15-year low income housing tax credit compliance period for Baldwin Villas expired on December 31, 2015, the investment general partner concluded that the investment limited partner's interest in Baldwin Villas had no value.  As a result, it agreed in the second quarter of 2016 to transfer the investment limited partner's interest in Baldwin Villas to an affiliate of the investment general partner for $1.  The subject transfer is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2016.

As a result, the investment limited partner lost future tax credits of $742,037, and incur recapture and interest penalty costs of $1,597,239, equivalent to approximately $185 and $398 per 1,000 BACs respectively.  Annual losses generated by the Operating Partnership, which were applied against the investment limited partnership's investment in the Operating Partnership in accordance with the equity method of accounting, had previously reduced the investment limited partnership investment in the Operating Partnership to zero.

  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
      
   None. 

Principal Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
 The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require the Fund to make various estimates and assumptions.  The following section is a summary of some aspects of those accounting policies that may require subjective or complex judgments and are most important to the portrayal of the Fund's financial condition and results of operations.  The Fund believes that there is a low probability that the use of different estimates or assumptions in making these judgments would result in materially different amounts being reported in the financial statements. 
   
 The Fund is required to assess potential impairments to its long-lived assets, which are primarily investments in limited partnerships.  The Fund accounts for its investment in limited partnerships in accordance with the equity method of accounting since the Fund does not control the operations of the Operating Partnerships. The purpose of an impairment analysis is to verify that the real estate investment balance reflected on the balance sheet does not exceed the value of the underlying investments. 
   
 If the book value of the Fund's investment in an Operating Partnership exceeds the estimated value derived by management, which generally consists of the remaining future Low-Income Housing Credits allocable to the Fund and the estimated residual value to the Fund, the Fund reduces its investment in the Operating Partnership. 
   
 The main reason an impairment loss typically occurs is that the annual operating losses, recorded in accordance with the equity method of accounting, of the investment in limited partnership does not reduce the balance as quickly as the annual use of the tax credits.  In years prior to the year ended March 31, 2009, management included remaining tax credits as well as residual value in the calculated value of the underlying investments. However, management decided to take a more conservative approach to the investment calculation and determined that the majority of the residual value component of the valuation was zero for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. However, it is important to note that this change in the accounting estimate to the calculation method of the impairment loss has no effect on the actual value or performance of the overall investment, nor does it have any effect on the remaining credits to be generated. 
     
   In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Fund determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE. The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors.  A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.   

Principal Accounting Policies and Estimates - continued 
    
 Based on this guidance, the Operating Partnerships in which the Fund invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations.  However, management does not consolidate the Fund's interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities.  The Fund currently records the amount of its investment in these partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements. The Fund's balance in investment in Operating Partnerships, advances made to Operating Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss.  The Fund's exposure to loss on these partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying Housing Complexes as well as the strength of the general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors of the Fund.

 In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis . This will improve certain areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures. ASU 2015-02 simplified and improves GAAP by: eliminating the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, eliminating the indefinite deferral of FASB Statement No. 167, thereby reducing the number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model), and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a factor to include in the consolidation of VIEs. ASU 2015-02 will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Fund has determined that there is no material impact to its financial statements as a result of this guidance.

  Controls and Procedures  

(a)  
 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund's general partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of C M Management Inc., carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Fund's  disclosure controls and procedures  as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole. Based on that evaluation, the Fund's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Fund's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information relating to any series or the Fund as a whole required to be disclosed by it in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Fund's management, including the Fund's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure with respect to each series individually, as well as the Fund as a whole.
