             The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements           5                    Atacama Resources International, Inc.     Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements     For the period ending September 30, 2016     (unaudited)         NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS         ORGANIZATION        Atacama Resources International, Inc. (hereinafter  ARII ) is a company incorporated in the State of Florida in June 2013. We were formed as a consultant to the mining industry.  The mining industry is subject to constant change due to market trends, thereby making it extremely competitive. The mining industry is complex, because several segments are regulated by both federal and state governments. ARII s approach assists general business operations with the growth and development, international expansion and marketing aspects of their business, allowing our potential customers to focus on the business aspects of operations. By using the services provided by ARII, our clients are free to focus on compliance with regulations within their industry, and to complete their primary business goals.       Atacama Resources International Inc. purchase 100% of Good2Drive LLC, a smartphone application company that establishes a baseline to test driver s alertness, in December 2015.  The acquisition includes the rights to two filed patent applications. The financial operations of Good2Drive LLC have been consolidated in the unaudited financial statements of Atacama Resources International Inc.        NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN        The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.  If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.       In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources.  Management s plan to obtain such resources for the Company include, obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses.  However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.       There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company.  In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations.  However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern        NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES         UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANICAL STATEMENTS    The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles. For complete financial statements please refer to our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on April 21, 2016.            6                   In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the consolidated financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year.        BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND USE OF ESTIMATES    The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.        CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS    The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,774 at September 30, 2016 and $8,477 at December 31, 2015.        CASH FLOWS REPORTING    The Company follows ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method ( Indirect method ) as defined by ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period.        EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS    Costs of acquiring mining properties and any exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred unless proven and probable reserves exist and the property is a commercially mineable property in accordance with FASB ASC 930, Extractive Activities   Mining.  Mine development costs incurred either to develop new gold and silver deposits, expand the capacity of operating mines, or to develop mine areas substantially in advance of current production are capitalized.  Costs incurred to maintain current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations.  Costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment.  The Company evaluates at least quarterly, the carrying value of capitalized mining costs and related property, plant and equipment costs, if any, to determine if these costs are in excess of their net realizable value and if a permanent impairment needs to be recorded.  The periodic evaluation of carrying value of capitalized costs and any related property, plant and equipment costs are based upon expected future cash flows and/or estimated salvage value.       The Company capitalizes costs for mining properties by individual property and defers such costs for later amortization only if the prospects for economic productions are reasonably certain.       Capitalized costs are expensed in the period when the termination has been made that economic production does not appear reasonably certain.       During the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded exploration costs of $18,344 and $41,397, respectively.        RELATED PARTIES    The Company follows ASC 850,  Related Party Disclosures,  for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.  Related party transactions are summarized in Note 7.            7                    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    The Company s consolidated balance sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.       ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:       Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities       Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.       Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.       Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.        REVENUE RECOGNITION    The Company follows ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.  The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.       The Company derives revenue from consulting arrangements with clients.  Revenue is generated by hourly fee structure or fixed contract costs, based on expected time to complete, additionally, costs incurred may be billed, as defined by the contractual arrangements.          DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND VALUATION ALLOWANCE    The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes.  Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs.  A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.  No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of September   30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.            8                    NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE    Net income (loss) per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share.   The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic earning or loss per share.  Diluted earnings or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and diluted potential common shares outstanding.  Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised.       Basic net income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no dilutive potential common shares.        SHARE-BASED EXPENSE    ASC 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation, prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired.  Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights.  Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).        The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, Equity   Based Payments to Non-Employees.  Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable:  (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued.  The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.         Share-based expense was $5,400 for the nine months ending September 30, 2016; $6,550 for the nine months ending September 30, 2015.        RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    Except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification  ( ASC ) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company.         We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU 2014-10 ) and have applied the standard as of the dates during the periods reported.       We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU 2014-9 ).  The Company on recognizing revenue in contracts with customers on an effective date after December 31, 2017, will be evaluated as to impact and implemented accordingly.       We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.        NOTE 4. PREPAID EXPENSE        The Company s prepaid expense consists of a retainer fee paid the law offices of Clifford J. Hunt, P.A. of $2,250 retainer; a last month rental fee for a storage facility of $1,644 and a deposit on mineral rights to CJP Exploration for $3,588.  The prepaid balance was $7,483 and $3,894, on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively .                  9                    NOTE 5.  INVESTMENTS   MINERAL RIGHTS      
                          September 30,   2016      December 31,   2015         Allsopp Properties: Mineral Rights acquired in the Kirkland  Lake Gold s Macassa mine Complex Ontario Canada. Consists of 1,680 acres.       Exploration costs of $50,000 annually for the first two years of the agreement are required to meet contractual commitments and have been incurred by December 2015. The valuation of these mineral rights have been re-measured and deemed to have no carrying value at September 30, 2016.        $       ---        $      9,222             NOTE 6.  INTANGIBLE ASSET        The Company owns a license in Good2Drive for $155,000, which also includes Good2Roll and Good2Pilot, it is a smartphone application that establishes a baseline to test driver s alertness. As of September 30, 2016, the intangible assets has been re-valued and deemed to have an impaired value of nil.        NOTE 7. NOTES PAYABLE      
               10                        NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES        At December 31, 2015, the Company had a net operating loss carry forward for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income through 2032  No tax benefit has been reported with respect to these net operating loss carry-forwards in the accompanying financial statements because the Company believes that the realization of the Company s net deferred tax assets   calculated at the effective rates note below, was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are fully offset by the valuation allowance.       Deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL carry-forwards. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding its realizability.       The tax effects of the temporary differences between reportable consolidated financial statement income and taxable income are recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities.       In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.  Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.       For the period ending September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company has net operating losses from operations. The carry forwards expire through the year 2032. The Company s net operating loss carry forward may be subject to annual limitations, which could reduce or defer the utilization of the losses as a result of an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. A valuation allowance has been applied due to the uncertainty of realization.       The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the period from inception ended December 31, 2013 through the year ended December 31, 2015.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense. The Company had incurred no penalties and interest through the year ended December 31, 2015.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.          Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.         This quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Atacama Resources International, Inc. for the period ended September 30, 2016 contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby.  To the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward looking statements which, by definition involve risks and uncertainties.  In particular, statements under the Sections; Description of Business, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward looking statements.  Where in any forward looking statements, the Company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished.       The following are factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated, and include but are not limited to: general economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in tax laws; and the cost and effects of legal proceedings.       You should not rely on forward looking statements in this quarterly report.  This quarterly report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  We use words such as  anticipates,   believes,   plans,   expects,   future,   intends,  and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements.  Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this quarterly report.  Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.         Our Business Overview         ARII is an operating company that provides consulting services to companies and individuals participating in the mining industry, manages actual mining operations and owns and sells smartphone Apps. We have conducted our mining operations in the Kirkland Lake region of Ontario, Canada,         Plan of Operation         Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to expand our client base to the extent that we pursue the corporate advisory market in the mining sector and continue to acquire mining claims, run geophysical testing, core drilling, analysis and assays to determine proven reserves appropriate steps to take in actual mining processes.  We will also develop international marketing and sales strategies for our Good2Drive App. As we continue to grow, we will need to raise additional funds. We do anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital. We do not have need for the purchase of any property or equipment at this time. ARII will not have any significant changes in the current number of employees.       Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations.  We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.         In order to continue as a going concern, we will need, among other things, additional capital resources.  Management s plan to obtain such resources include, obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses.  However, management cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.            14                   12 Month Growth Strategy and Milestones       While a strategic and wisely executed marketing campaign is key to expanding our customer base; providing innovative strategies developed and implemented for our clients and customers, will provide a solid platform upon which our operations will continue to grow and deliver long-term success.       Note: The following milestones are based on our business development strategy.     
               0-3 Months      Initiate revenue targets for the sale/subscription of Good2Drive.         Complete assay results for the first two drills at Atacama one mine site.         Produce marketing materials and explore online marketing options.         Research and determine future priority market opportunities         Establish marketing and communications strategy.         4-6 Months      Build business development and support team.         Create expanded growth and corporate development strategy for business expansion in certain US regions that have been identified as high-potential market opportunities for the company.         Implement Investor Relations program.         Implement a communication schedule for internal and external stakeholders in accordance with SEC guidelines and best practices.         7-9 Months      Expand Board of Directors to include independent directors.         Commence long-range financial and growth planning for successive 2 and 3 year periods.         10-12 Months      Any need for outside services in which we cannot provide will all be initially outsourced in order to cut costs by not having facilities in excess of our needs.  The company will not attempt to establish relationships with providers of outsourcing services until the company will be able to utilize such services.             Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company        We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:                                               A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD                                                   Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;                                                  Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company s executive compensation arrangements; and                                                  No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.           We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-Q, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).       In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) for complying with new or revised accounting standards.  We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act.  This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.            15                   We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.       We are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Exchange Act.        Critical Accounting Policies         We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.  On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.         While we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.       For a full description of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.      Results of Consolidated Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.         The Company did not record any revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We expensed exploration costs of $18,344, professional fees of $26,938, property taxes of $548, consulting fees of $58,689, management fees of $249,000, and selling and administrative costs of $15,381, and travel costs of $4,582 resulting in total operating expenses of $373,482. We accrued interest expenses of $19,427, loss on conversion of debt of $247,135; impairment losses on intangible assets of $155,000, losses on investment re-valuation of $9,222 and foreign exchange losses of $2,293. As a result, we had a net comprehensive loss of $804,226 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       Comparatively, the Company did not record any revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

The $709,616 increase in net comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to increase management fees, impairment losses on intangible assets, loss on conversion of debt and losses on re-valuing investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.            16                     Results of Consolidated Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015         The Company did not record any revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

As a result, we had a net comprehensive loss of $559,208 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.       Comparatively, the Company did not record any revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2015. We expensed consulting fees of $7,465, exploration costs of $37,318, and selling and administrative costs of $779, stock based compensation of $6,550, travel costs of $2,334 resulting in total operating expenses of $54,446. We accrued interest expenses of $5,848 and foreign exchange losses of $2,667 resulting in a net comprehensive loss of $62,961 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.       The 496,247 increase in net comprehensive loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to increase in management fees, impairment losses on intangible assets and losses on re-valuing investments during the three months ended September 30, 2016.        Consolidated Financial Condition         Total Assets .  Total assets at were $9257 and $176,593 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Total assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of cash of $1,774 and $8,477, respectively; prepaid expense of $7,483 and $3,894,respectively; investments of $-0- and $9,222, respectively; and intangible assets of $-0- and $155,000, respectively.  Total assets were due to cash received via subscription agreements and a consulting contract. The prepaid expense was due to a legal retainer payment. The investment was due to purchased mineral rights of $9,222 and the intangible asset was due to the acquisition of an application company, Good2Drive LLC of $155,000. The Company re-measured and re-valued the investment and intangible asset to their impaired values as of September 30, 2016        Total Liabilities .  Total liabilities were $672,064 and $635,842 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Total liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of accounts payable of $442,887 and $290,702, respectively; notes payable of $143,880 and $276,984, respectively; due to related parties of $5,608 and $8,803, respectively and accrued interest of $79,689 and $59,353, respectively.  Total liabilities were due to the promissory note related to consulting contracts and a payable associated with the preparation of the S1 registration statement and operating expenses.        Consolidated Liquidity and Capital Resources        The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.         The Company sustained a loss for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 of $806,559.  The Company has an accumulated loss of $1,425,788 as of September 30, 2016.  Because of the absence of positive cash flows from operations, the Company will require additional funding for continuing the development and marketing of services.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.       We are presently unable to meet our obligations as they come due.  At September 30, 2016 we had working capital deficit of $662,807.  Our working capital deficit is due to the results of operations.            17                   Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was ($220,389) and ($20,036), respectively.   Net cash used in operating activities includes our net loss, stock based compensation, Impairment of intangible assets, loss on investment re-valuation, loss on conversion of debt, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued interest.       Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $215,979 and $18,471, respectively.  Net cash provided by financing activities included proceeds from related parties of $(3,195) and $3,664, respectively, proceeds (payments)from (to) notes payable of  $(133,024) and $14,807, respectively, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $352,198 and $-0-, respectively.       We anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to fund our growth from operations, pay current obligations and future capital expenditures. The primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from the private sources and/or debt financing.  However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, to remain a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability.  Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our company s securities after the completion of this offering.  We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.  See  Note 2   Going Concern  in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a  going concern.        We are not aware of any trends or known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in material increases or decreases in liquidity.        Capital Resources.        We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2016.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements        We have made no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.             Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.        We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.         Item 4. Controls and Procedures .          (a)          Management s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.         The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.            18                   With respect to the period ending September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.       Based upon our evaluation regarding the period ending September 30, 2016, the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, have added a Chief Financial Officer to oversee the financial information at multiple levels. Though there may be material weaknesses from a lack of a majority of outside directors on the board of directors, the placement of a Chief Financial Officer has compensated for this weakness. Through the use of external consultants and the review process, management believes that the consolidated financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures were not effective so as to timely identify, correct and disclose information required to be included on our Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) reports due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review.        The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.  However, the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.      (b)        Changes in Internal Controls.         There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.       For a full discussion of controls and procedures refer to Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10K.             19                    Part II.
