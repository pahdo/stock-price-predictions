FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF DES MOINES    
  CONDENSED NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Background Information    
    
  The Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the Bank) is a federally chartered corporation organized on October 31, 1932, that is exempt from all federal, state, and local taxation (except real property taxes) and is one of   11   district Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks). The FHLBanks were created under the authority of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 (FHLBank Act). With the passage of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (Housing Act), the Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency) was established and became the new independent federal regulator of Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (collectively, Enterprises), as well as the FHLBanks and FHLBanks' Office of Finance, effective July 30, 2008. The Finance Agency's mission is to ensure that the Enterprises and FHLBanks operate in a safe and sound manner so that they serve as a reliable source of liquidity and funding for housing finance and community investment. The Finance Agency establishes policies and regulations governing the operations of the Enterprises and FHLBanks. Each FHLBank operates as a separate entity with its own management, employees, and board of directors. 
    
  The FHLBanks are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that serve the public by enhancing the availability of funds for residential mortgages and targeted community development. The Bank provides a readily available source of funding to its member institutions and eligible housing associates in Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and the U.S. Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, insurance companies, and community development financial institutions (CDFIs) may apply for membership. State and local housing associates that meet certain statutory criteria may also borrow from the Bank; while eligible to borrow, housing associates are not members of the Bank and, as such, are not permitted to hold capital stock. 
    
  The Bank is a cooperative. This means the Bank is owned by its customers, whom the Bank calls members. As a condition of membership in the Bank, all members must purchase and maintain membership capital stock based on a percentage of their total assets, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, as of the preceding December 31   st   . Each member is also required to purchase and maintain activity-based capital stock to support certain business activities with the Bank.  
    
  The Bank's current and former members own all of the outstanding capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) of the Bank. Former members own capital stock to support business transactions still carried on the Bank's Statements of Condition. All stockholders, including current and former members, may receive dividends on their capital stock investment to the extent declared by the Bank's Board of Directors.

Note 1   Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are contained in the Bank's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   March 21, 2016   (  2015   Form 10-K).  
    
  In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial information is complete and reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31,   2016  . 
    
  On May 31, 2015, the Bank completed the merger (the Merger) with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (Seattle Bank). The Merger had a significant impact on all aspects of the Bank's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. As a result, income statement results for the current period are not directly comparable to results prior to the Merger. 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared by adjusting the Bank's historical data to give effect to the Merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2014 (dollars in millions): 

The unaudited pro forma financial information was prepared in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for mutual entities under existing standards and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the Merger had been completed on the date indicated, nor is it indicative of the future operating results of the Bank.  
    
  CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE 
    
  On January 1, 2016, the Bank retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Codification Update 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on April 7, 2015. As a result, $7 million of unamortized concessions included in  Other assets  at December 31, 2015 were reclassified as a reduction in the balance of the corresponding consolidated obligations. The reclassification resulted in a decrease of   $4 million   in  Consolidated obligation discount notes  and of   $3 million   in  Consolidated obligation bonds  at December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the Bank s total assets and total liabilities each decreased by   $7 million   at December 31, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on the Bank s results of operations or cash flows. See  Note 2 - Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Guidance  for discussion on this guidance. 
    
  RECLASSIFICATIONS 
    
  Certain amounts in the Bank's   2015   financial statements and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . These amounts were not deemed to be material. 
    
  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  There have been no material changes to the Bank's significant accounting policies during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , with the exception of one policy noted below. Descriptions of all significant accounting policies are included in "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the 2015 Form 10-K.

     Table of Contents     

Concessions  . The Bank pays concessions to dealers in connection with the issuance of certain consolidated obligations. The Office of Finance prorates the amount of the concession to each FHLBank based upon the percentage of the debt issued that is attributed to that FHLBank. Concessions paid on consolidated obligations designated under the fair value option are expensed as incurred and recorded in other expense. Concessions paid on consolidated obligations not designated under the fair value option are deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the consolidated obligations using the level-yield method. Unamortized concessions are included as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of  Consolidated obligation discount notes  or  Consolidated obligation bonds  in the Statements of Condition and the amortization of those concessions is included in consolidated obligation interest expense. 

Note 2   Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Guidance 
    
  ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE 
    
  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships 
    
  On March 10, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under GAAP does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The amendments provide entities with the option to apply the guidance using either a prospective approach or a modified retrospective approach.  The guidance would have become effective for the Bank in 2017 but the guidance allowed early adoption. The Bank elected to early adopt this guidance prospectively on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments 
    
  On September 25, 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments recognized in a business combination. This guidance requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. It also requires that the acquirer present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. This guidance became effective for the Bank beginning on January 1, 2016 and was adopted prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  
    
  Cloud Computing Arrangements 
    
  On April 15, 2015, the FASB issued amendments to clarify a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendments provide guidance to customers on determining whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, it would be accounted for as a service contract. This guidance became effective for the Bank beginning on January 1, 2016 and was adopted prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not effect the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  
    
  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 
    
  On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the statement of condition as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. This guidance became effective for the Bank beginning on January 1, 2016 and was adopted on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a reclassification of unamortized debt issuance costs from other assets to consolidated obligations on the Bank's Statement of Condition. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Bank's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Refer to "Note 1   Basis of Presentation   Change in Accounting Principle" for additional details on this reclassification.

     Table of Contents     

Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 
    
  On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance intended to enhance consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security transactions). The new guidance primarily focuses on the following: 

Placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. A reporting     organization     may     no longer have to consolidate a legal entity in certain circumstances based solely on its fee arrangement,     when     certain     criteria are met.     

Reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling     financial     interest     in a variable interest entity (VIE). 

Changing consolidation conclusions for entities in several industries that typically make use of limited     partnerships     or     VIEs. 
       
  This guidance became effective for the Bank beginning on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  
    
  ISSUED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE 
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
    
  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is intended to reduce existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for the Bank for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, but its effect on the Bank's cash flows is not expected to be material. 
  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
    
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for the accounting of credit losses on financial instruments. The amendments require entities to measure expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. The new guidance requires a financial asset, or a group of financial assets, measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The guidance also requires, among other things, the following: 
             
    The statement of income to reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. 

Entities to determine the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination (PCD assets) that are measured at amortized cost in a similar manner to other financial assets measured at amortized cost. The initial allowance for credit losses is required to be added to the purchase price of the assets acquired. 

Entities to record credit losses relating to AFS debt securities through an allowance for credit losses. The amendments limit the allowance for credit losses to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. 

Public entities to further disaggregate the current disclosure of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables by the year of origination (i.e., vintage).

     Table of Contents     

This guidance is effective for the Bank for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2020. Early application is permitted as of the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. This guidance should be applied using a modified-retrospective approach, through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. In addition, entities are required to use a prospective transition approach for PCD assets upon adoption and for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its effect on the Bank's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows has not yet been determined.  
  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments 
    
  On March 14, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. The guidance requires entities to apply only the four-step decision sequence when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts. Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. This guidance becomes effective for the Bank for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the period for which the amendments are effective. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, but its effect on the Bank's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows is not expected to be material. 
  Leases 
    
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the statement of condition and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Specifically, this guidance requires a lessee, of operating or finance leases, to recognize on the statement of condition a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Under previous GAAP, a lessee was not required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the statement of condition. While this guidance does not fundamentally change lessor accounting, some changes have been made to align that guidance with the lessee guidance and other areas within GAAP. 
    
  The guidance becomes effective for the Bank for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2019, and early application is permitted. The guidance requires lessors and lessees to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements using a modified retrospective approach. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its anticipated effect on the Bank's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows has not yet been determined. 
    
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
    
  On January 5, 2016, FASB issued amended guidance on certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This guidance includes, but is not limited to, the following:  

Requires equity investments (with certain exceptions) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 

Requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.  

Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.   

Eliminates the requirement for public entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.

The amendments, in general, should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its effect on the Bank's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows is not expected to be material.  
    
  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
    
  On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This guidance requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable. Substantial doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations for the assessed period. This guidance becomes effective for the Bank for the annual period ending December 31, 2016 and for the annual and interim periods thereafter, and early application is permitted. This guidance is not expected to have an effect on the Bank's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or financial statement disclosures. 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
    
  On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. This guidance outlines a single comprehensive model for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. In addition, this guidance amends the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of non-financial assets that are not in a contract with a customer. This guidance applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of certain other standards, such as financial instruments, certain guarantees, insurance contracts, and lease contracts. The guidance provides entities with the option of using either of the following adoption methods: a full retrospective method, retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented; or a modified retrospective method, retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this guidance recognized at the date of initial application.  
    
  On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date of this guidance issued in May 2014 by one year. In 2016, the FASB has issued additional amendments to clarify certain aspects of the new revenue guidance. However, these amendments do not change the core principle in the new revenue standard.  
    
  This guidance is effective for the Bank for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted only as of the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, but its effect on the Bank's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is not expected to be material.

Note 6   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment  
    
  The Bank evaluates its individual AFS and HTM securities in an unrealized loss position for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. As part of its evaluation of securities for OTTI, the Bank considers its intent to sell each debt security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions is met, the Bank will recognize an OTTI charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the reporting date. For securities in an unrealized loss position that meet neither of these conditions, the Bank performs analyses to determine if any of these securities are other-than-temporarily impaired.   
    
  PRIVATE-LABEL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES  
    
  On a quarterly basis, the Bank engages other designated FHLBanks to perform cash flow analyses on its private-label MBS using   two   third-party models in order to assess whether the entire amortized cost bases of these securities will be recovered. To ensure consistency in the determination of OTTI, an OTTI Governance Committee, comprised of representation from all FHLBanks, is responsible for reviewing and approving the key modeling assumptions, inputs, and methodologies used by the designated FHLBanks when generating the cash flow projections. For a description of these models, refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8 - Other-than-Temporary Impairment" in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  The FHLBanks' OTTI Governance Committee developed a short-term housing price forecast with projected changes ranging from a decrease of   one percent   to an increase of   ten percent   over the twelve month period beginning   July 1, 2016  . For the vast majority of markets, the projected short-term housing price changes range from an increase of   three percent   to an increase of   six percent  . Thereafter, a unique path is projected for each geographical area based on an internally developed framework derived from historical data.  
    
  The Bank compared the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected with respect to its private-label MBS to the amortized cost bases of the securities to determine whether a credit loss existed. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank's cash flow analyses for private-label MBS did not project any credit losses. Even under an adverse scenario that delays recovery of the housing price index, no credit losses were projected. The Bank does not intend to sell its private-label MBS and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell its private-label MBS before recovery of their amortized cost bases. As a result, the Bank did not consider any of its private-label MBS to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .

ALL OTHER AFS AND HTM INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
    
  On a quarterly basis, the Bank reviews all remaining AFS and HTM securities in an unrealized loss position to determine whether they are other-than temporarily impaired. The following was determined for the Bank's other investment securities in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016  : 

Other U.S. obligations and GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations.   The unrealized losses were due primarily to changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and not to a significant deterioration in the fundamental credit quality of the obligations. The strength of the issuers' guarantees through direct obligations or support from the U.S. Government was sufficient to protect the Bank from losses based on current expectations. The Bank expects to recover the amortized cost bases on these securities and neither intends to sell these securities nor considers it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases. As such, the Bank did not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .  

State or local housing agency obligations  . The unrealized losses were due to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and illiquidity in the credit markets, and not to a significant deterioration in the fundamental credit quality of the obligations. The creditworthiness of the issuers and the strength of the underlying collateral and credit enhancements were sufficient to protect the Bank from losses based on current expectations. The Bank does not intend to sell these securities nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases. As such, the Bank did not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .

The following table summarizes all advances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , by year of contractual maturity or next call date for callable advances, and by year of contractual maturity or next put date for putable advances (dollars in millions): 

The Bank offers advances to members and eligible housing associates that may be prepaid on pertinent dates (call dates) prior to maturity without incurring prepayment fees (callable advances). At   September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  ,     the Bank had callable advances outstanding totaling   $78.6 billion   and   $54.8 billion  .  
    
  The Bank also offers putable advances. With a putable advance, the Bank has the right to terminate the advance from the borrower on predetermined exercise dates, and the borrower may then apply for replacement funding at the prevailing market rate. Generally, put options are exercised when interest rates increase. At   September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  , t  he Bank had putable advances outstanding totaling   $2.1 billion   and   $2.6 billion  .  
    
  PREPAYMENT FEES 
    
  The Bank generally charges a prepayment fee for advances that a borrower elects to terminate prior to the stated maturity or outside of a predetermined call or put date. The fees charged are priced to make the Bank financially indifferent to the prepayment of the advance. For certain advances with symmetrical prepayment features, the Bank may charge the borrower a prepayment fee or pay the borrower a prepayment credit, depending on certain circumstances, such as movements in interest rates, when the advance is prepaid. Prepayment fees and credits are recorded net of fair value hedging adjustments in the Statements of Income.

Note 8   Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio    
    
  The Bank participates in the Mortgage Partnership Finance (MPF) program (Mortgage Partnership Finance and MPF are registered trademarks of the FHLBank of Chicago). This program involves investment by the Bank in single-family mortgage loans held for portfolio that are either purchased from participating financial institutions (PFIs) or funded by the Bank through PFIs. MPF loans may also be acquired through participations in pools of eligible mortgage loans purchased from other FHLBanks. The Bank's MPF PFIs generally originate, service, and credit enhance mortgage loans that are sold to the Bank. MPF PFIs participating in the servicing release program do not service the loans owned by the Bank. The servicing on these loans is sold concurrently by the MPF PFI to a designated mortgage service provider.

     Table of Contents     

Effective May 31, 2015, as a part of the Merger, the Bank acquired mortgage loans previously purchased by the Seattle Bank under the Mortgage Purchase Program (MPP). This program involved investment by the Seattle Bank in single-family mortgage loans that were purchased directly from MPP PFIs. Similar to the MPF program, MPP PFIs generally originated, serviced, and credit enhanced the mortgage loans sold to the Seattle Bank. In 2005, the Seattle Bank ceased entering into new MPP master commitment contracts and therefore all MPP loans acquired by the Bank were originated prior to 2006. The Bank does not currently purchase mortgage loans under this program.

Note 9   Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  The Bank has established an allowance for credit losses methodology for each of its financing receivable portfolio segments: advances, standby letters of credit, and other extensions of credit to borrowers (collectively, credit products), government-insured mortgage loans held for portfolio, MPF conventional mortgage loans held for portfolio, MPP conventional mortgage loans held for portfolio, and term securities purchased under agreements to resell. 
    
  CREDIT PRODUCTS 
    
  The Bank manages its credit exposure to credit products through an approach that includes establishing a credit limit for each borrower, ongoing reviews of each borrower's financial condition, and detailed collateral and lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers' needs for a reliable source of funding. In addition, the Bank lends to eligible borrowers in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and other applicable laws. 
    
  The Bank is required by regulation to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure credit products. The estimated value of the collateral required to secure each borrower's credit products is calculated by applying collateral discounts, or haircuts, to the unpaid principal balance or market value, if available, of the collateral. Eligible collateral includes (i) whole first mortgages on improved residential real property or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages, (ii) loans and securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Government National Mortgage Association and Federal Family Education Loan Program guaranteed student loans, (iii) cash deposited with the Bank, and (iv) other real estate-related collateral acceptable to the Bank provided such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and the Bank can perfect a security interest in such property. In addition, community financial institutions may also pledge collateral consisting of secured small business, small agri-business, or small farm loans. As additional security, the FHLBank Act provides that the Bank has a lien on each member's capital stock investment; however, capital stock cannot be pledged as collateral to secure credit exposures. 
    
  Collateral arrangements may vary depending upon borrower credit quality, financial condition and performance, borrowing capacity, and overall credit exposure to the borrower. The Bank can also require additional or substitute collateral to protect its security interest. The Bank periodically evaluates and makes changes to its collateral guidelines and collateral haircuts.  
    
  Borrowers may pledge collateral to the Bank by executing a blanket lien, specifically assigning collateral, or placing physical possession of collateral with the Bank or its custodians. The Bank perfects its security interest in all pledged collateral by filing Uniform Commercial Code financing statements or by taking possession or control of the collateral. Under the FHLBank Act, any security interest granted to the Bank by its members, or any affiliates of its members, has priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor), unless those claims and rights would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual purchasers or by parties that have perfected security interests.  
  Under a blanket lien, the Bank is granted a security interest in all financial assets of the borrower to fully secure the borrower's obligation. Other than securities and cash deposits, the Bank does not initially take delivery of collateral pledged by blanket lien borrowers. In the event of deterioration in the financial condition of a blanket lien borrower, the Bank has the ability to require delivery of pledged collateral sufficient to secure the borrower's obligation. With respect to non-blanket lien borrowers that are federally insured, the Bank generally requires collateral to be specifically assigned. With respect to non-blanket lien borrowers that are not federally insured (typically insurance companies, CDFIs, and housing associates), the Bank generally takes control of collateral through the delivery of cash, securities, or loans to the Bank or its custodians.  
    
  Using a risk-based approach and taking into consideration each borrower's financial strength, the Bank considers the types and level of collateral to be the primary indicator of credit quality on its credit products. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had rights to collateral on a borrower-by-borrower basis with an unpaid principal balance or market value, if available, in excess of its outstanding extensions of credit.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , none of the Bank's credit products were past due, on non-accrual status, or considered impaired. In addition, there were no troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) related to credit products during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The Bank has never experienced a credit loss on its credit products. Based upon the Bank's collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on credit products, management has determined that there were no probable credit losses on its credit products as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Accordingly, the Bank has not recorded any allowance for credit losses for its credit products. 
  
   25 

     Table of Contents     

GOVERNMENT-INSURED MORTGAGE LOANS  
    
  The Bank invests in government-insured fixed rate mortgage loans in both the MPF and MPP portfolios that are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and/or the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture. The servicer or PFI obtains and maintains insurance or a guaranty from the applicable government agency. The servicer or PFI is responsible for compliance with all government agency requirements and for obtaining the benefit of the applicable guarantee or insurance with respect to defaulted government-insured mortgage loans. Any losses incurred on these loans that are not recovered from the insurer/guarantor are absorbed by the servicers. As such, the Bank only has credit risk for these loans if the servicer or PFI fails to pay for losses not covered by the guarantee or insurance. Management views this risk as remote and has never experienced a credit loss on its government-insured mortgage loans. As a result, the Bank did not establish an allowance for credit losses for its government-insured mortgage loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Furthermore, none of these mortgage loans have been placed on non-accrual status because of the U.S. Government guarantee or insurance on these loans and the contractual obligation of the loan servicer to repurchase the loans when certain criteria are met. 
    
  MPF CONVENTIONAL MORTGAGE LOANS 
    
  The Bank's management of credit risk in the MPF program involves several layers of legal loss protection that are defined in agreements among the Bank and its participating PFIs. For conventional MPF loans, the availability of loss protection may differ slightly among MPF products. The Bank's loss protection consists of the following loss layers, in order of priority:  

Homeowner Equity. 

Primary Mortgage Insurance (PMI).   At the time of origination, PMI is required on all loans with homeowner equity of less than 20 percent of the original purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less and as applicable to the specific loan. 

First Loss Account (FLA).   The FLA is a memorandum account used to track the Bank's potential loss exposure under each master commitment prior to the PFI's credit enhancement obligation.  

Credit Enhancement Obligation of PFI.   PFIs have a credit enhancement obligation at the time a mortgage loan is purchased to absorb certain losses in excess of the FLA in order to limit the Bank's loss exposure to that of an investor in an MBS that is rated the equivalent of AA by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO). PFIs pledge collateral to secure this obligation. For absorbing losses in excess of the FLA, PFIs are paid a credit enhancement fee, a portion of which may be performance-based. 
       
  MPP CONVENTIONAL MORTGAGE LOANS 
    
  For conventional MPP loans, the loss protection consists of the following loss layers, in order of priority:  

Homeowner Equity. 

Primary Mortgage Insurance.   At the time of origination, PMI is required on all loans with homeowner equity of less than 20 percent of the original purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less and as applicable to the specific loan. 

Lender Risk Account (LRA).   The LRA is a lender-specific account originally funded by the Seattle Bank in an amount approximately sufficient to cover expected losses on the pool of mortgages either up front as a portion of the purchase proceeds or through a portion of the net interest remitted monthly by the member. To the extent available, LRA funds are used to offset any losses that occur. Typically, after five years, excess funds over required balances are distributed to the member in accordance with a step-down schedule that is established upon execution of a master commitment contract.

ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY 
    
  The Bank utilizes an allowance for credit losses to reserve for estimated losses in its conventional MPF and MPP mortgage loan portfolios at the balance sheet date. The measurement of the Bank's MPF and MPP allowance for credit losses is determined by (i) reviewing similar conventional mortgage loans for impairment on a collective basis, (ii) reviewing conventional mortgage loans for impairment on an individual basis, and (iii) estimating additional credit losses in the conventional mortgage loan portfolio. 
    
   Collectively Evaluated Conventional Mortgage Loans  . The Bank collectively evaluates the majority of its conventional MPF and MPP mortgage loan portfolios for impairment and estimates an allowance for credit losses based primarily on the following factors: (i) current loan delinquencies, (ii) loans migrating to collateral-dependent status, and (iii) actual historical loss severities. The Bank utilizes a roll-rate methodology when estimating its allowance for credit losses. This methodology projects loans migrating to collateral-dependent status based on historical average rates of delinquency. The Bank then applies a loss severity factor to calculate an estimate of credit losses. 
    
  Individually Identified Conventional Mortgage Loans  . The Bank individually evaluates certain MPF and MPP conventional mortgage loans, including TDRs and collateral-dependent loans, for impairment. The Bank's TDRs include loans granted under its loan modification plans and loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy that have not been reaffirmed by the borrower. The Bank generally measures impairment of TDRs based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. Collateral-dependent loans are loans in which repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral. The Bank's collateral-dependent loans include loans in process of foreclosure, loans 180 days or more past due, and bankruptcy loans and TDRs 60 days or more past due. The Bank measures impairment of collateral-dependent loans based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, which is determined using property values, less selling costs and expected proceeds from PMI. 
    
  A charge-off is recorded if it is estimated that the recorded investment in a loan will not be recovered. The Bank evaluates whether to record a charge-off based upon the occurrence of a confirming event, including but not limited to, the occurrence of foreclosure or when a loan is deemed collateral-dependent. The Bank charges-off the portion of the outstanding conventional mortgage loan balance in excess of the fair value of the underlying collateral, which is determined using property values, less selling costs and expected proceeds from PMI. 
    
  Estimating Additional Credit Loss in the MPF and MPP Conventional Mortgage Loan Portfolios  . The Bank may make adjustments for certain limitations in its estimation of credit losses. These adjustments recognize the imprecise nature of an estimate and represents a subjective management judgment that is intended to cover losses resulting from other factors that may not be captured in the methodology previously described at the balance sheet date.  These additional factors include, but are not limited to certain quantifiable economic factors, such as unemployment rates and home prices impacting housing markets.

INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATED IMPAIRED LOANS 
    
   As previously described, the Bank evaluates certain conventional mortgage loans for impairment individually. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  
    
  The Bank did   no  t recognize any interest income on impaired loans during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had   $5 million   and   $7 million   of real estate owned (REO) recorded as a component of "Other assets" in the Statements of Condition.  
    
  TERM SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL  
    
  Term securities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing agreements and represent short-term investments. The terms of these investments are structured such that if the market value of the underlying securities decreases below the market value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. Otherwise, the dollar value of the resale agreement will decrease accordingly. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement will be charged to earnings to establish an allowance for credit losses. Based upon the collateral held as security, the Bank determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for its term securities purchased under agreements to resell at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank did not record a liability to reflect an allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures. For additional information on the Bank's off-balance sheet credit exposures, see "Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies."

Note 10   Derivatives and Hedging Activities    
    
  NATURE OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY    
    
  The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the effect of interest rate changes on its interest-earning assets and its related funding sources. The goal of the Bank's interest rate risk management strategy is not to eliminate interest rate risk, but to manage it within appropriate limits. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Bank has established policies and procedures, which include guidelines on the amount of exposure to interest rate changes it is willing to accept.  
    
  The Bank enters into derivative contracts to manage the interest rate risk exposures inherent in its otherwise unhedged assets and funding positions. Finance Agency regulations and the Bank's Enterprise Risk Management Policy (ERMP) establish guidelines for derivatives, prohibit trading in or the speculative use of derivatives, and limit credit risk arising from derivatives. 
    
  The most common ways in which the Bank uses derivatives are to:  

reduce the interest rate sensitivity and repricing gaps of assets and liabilities; 

preserve a favorable interest rate spread between the yield of an asset and the cost of the related liability. Without the use of derivatives, this interest rate spread could be reduced or eliminated when a change in the interest rate on the asset does not match a change in the interest rate on the liability; 

mitigate the adverse earnings effects of the shortening or extension of certain assets and liabilities; 

manage embedded options in assets and liabilities; and 

reduce funding costs by combining a derivative with a consolidated obligation, as the cost of a combined funding structure can be lower than the cost of a comparable consolidated obligation. 
       
  APPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES  
    
  Derivative instruments are accounted for by the Bank in two ways:  

as a fair value hedge of an associated financial instrument or firm commitment for those items qualifying under applicable accounting guidance (fair value hedge); or 

as an economic hedge to manage certain defined risks in its Statements of Condition. These hedges are primarily used to (i) manage mismatches between the coupon features of the Bank's assets and liabilities and offset prepayment risk in certain assets, or (ii) mitigate the income statement volatility that occurs when financial instruments are recorded at fair value and hedge accounting is not permitted by accounting guidance (economic hedge).  
       
  Derivative instruments are used by the Bank when they are considered to be a cost-effective alternative to achieve the Bank's financial and risk management objectives. The Bank reevaluates its hedging strategies from time to time and may change the hedging techniques it uses or adopt new strategies. 
    
  The Bank transacts most of its derivative transactions with large banks and major broker-dealers. Over-the-counter derivative transactions may be either executed directly with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent) with a Derivative Clearing Organization (cleared derivatives). Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearinghouse), the derivative transaction is novated and the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse.

     Table of Contents     

TYPES OF DERIVATIVES 
    
  The Bank may use the following derivative instruments:  

interest rate swaps; 

options;  

swaptions; 

interest rate caps and floors; and 

future/forward contracts. 
       
  TYPES OF HEDGED ITEMS 
    
  The Bank documents at inception all fair value hedging relationships between derivatives designated as hedging instruments and hedged items, its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions, and its method of assessing effectiveness. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to assets and liabilities in the Statements of Condition or firm commitments. The Bank also formally assesses (both at the hedge's inception and monthly) whether the derivatives it uses in hedging transactions have been effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk and whether those derivatives are expected to remain effective in future periods. The Bank uses regression analyses to assess the effectiveness of its hedges.   
    
  The Bank may have the following types of hedged items: 

investment securities; 

advances; 

mortgage loans; 

consolidated obligations; and 

firm commitments. 
       
  FINANCIAL STATEMENT EFFECT AND ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
    
  The notional amount of derivatives serves as a factor in determining periodic interest payments and cash flows received and paid. However, the notional amount of derivatives represents neither the actual amounts exchanged nor the overall exposure of the Bank to credit and market risk. The risks of derivatives can be measured meaningfully on a portfolio basis that takes into account the counterparties, the types of derivatives, the items being hedged, and any offsets between the derivatives and the items being hedged.  

32 

     Table of Contents     

The following table summarizes the Bank's notional amount and the fair value of derivative instruments, including the effect of netting adjustments and cash collateral. For purposes of this disclosure, the derivative values include the fair value of derivatives and the related accrued interest     (dollars in millions): 

1  
    Amounts represent the application of the netting requirements that allow the Bank to net settle positive and negative positions and also cash collateral and the related accrued interest held or placed with the same clearing agent and/or counterparty. Cash collateral posted by the Bank (including accrued interest) was $0.9 billion and $0.5 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank had not received any cash collateral from clearing agents and/or counterparties.

The following tables summarize, by type of hedged item, the gains (losses) on derivatives and the related hedged items in fair value hedging relationships, the net fair value hedge ineffectiveness, and the effect of those derivatives on the Bank's net interest income (dollars in millions):   

1 
    Represents the net interest settlements on derivatives in fair value hedge relationships and the amortization of the financing element of off-market derivatives, both of which are included in the interest income or interest expense line item of the respective hedged item type. This amortization for off-market derivatives totaled $7 million and $23 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The amortization totaled $10 million and $13 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
       
           2 
    Includes net gains (losses) on fair value hedge firm commitments of forward starting advances. 
       
  MANAGING CREDIT RISK ON DERIVATIVES  
    
  The Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative contracts. The Bank manages credit risk through credit analyses, collateral requirements, and adherence to the requirements set forth in the Bank's policies, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations, and Finance Agency regulations. For uncleared derivatives, the degree of credit risk depends on the extent to which master netting arrangements are included in these contracts to mitigate the risk. The Bank requires collateral agreements with collateral delivery thresholds on the majority of its uncleared derivatives.  

34 

     Table of Contents     

For cleared derivatives, the Clearinghouse is the Bank's counterparty. The Clearinghouse notifies the clearing agent of the required initial and variation margin and the clearing agent in turn notifies the Bank. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk if the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral for changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives is posted daily through a clearing agent.  
    
  The Bank has analyzed the enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in its cleared derivative transactions and has determined that the exercise of those offsetting rights by a non-defaulting party under these transactions should be upheld under applicable law upon an event of default, including a bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceeding involving the Clearinghouse or the clearing agent, or both. Based on this analysis, the Bank presents a net derivative receivable or payable for all of its transactions through a particular clearing agent with a particular Clearinghouse. 
    
  A majority of the Bank's uncleared derivative contracts contain provisions that require the Bank to post additional collateral with its counterparties if there is deterioration in the Bank's credit rating. If the Bank's credit rating is lowered by an NRSRO, the Bank may be required to deliver additional collateral on uncleared derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all uncleared derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position (before cash collateral and related accrued interest) at   September 30, 2016   was   $431 million  , for which the Bank posted collateral of   $352 million   in the normal course of business. If the Bank's credit rating had been lowered from its current rating to the next lower rating that would have triggered additional collateral to be delivered, the Bank would have been required to deliver an additional   $71 million   of collateral to its uncleared derivative counterparties at   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  For cleared derivatives, the Clearinghouse determines initial margin requirements and generally credit ratings are not factored into the initial margin. However, clearing agents may require additional initial margin to be posted based on credit considerations, including but not limited to, credit rating downgrades. The Bank was not required to post additional initial margin by its clearing agents, based on credit considerations, at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  OFFSETTING OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES 
    
  The Bank presents derivative instruments, related cash collateral, including initial and variation margin, received or pledged, and associated accrued interest on a net basis by clearing agent and/or by counterparty when it has met the netting requirements. The following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments meeting or not meeting the netting requirements, including the related collateral received from or pledged to counterparties (dollars in millions):

Note 11   Consolidated Obligations 
    
  Consolidated obligations consist of bonds and discount notes. The FHLBanks issue consolidated obligations through the Office of Finance as their agent. Bonds are issued primarily to raise intermediate- and long-term funds for the Bank and are not subject to any statutory or regulatory limits on their maturity. Discount notes are issued primarily to raise short-term funds for the Bank and have original maturities of up to one year. Discount notes sell at or below their face amount and are redeemed at par value when they mature. 
    
  Although the Bank is primarily liable for the portion of consolidated obligations issued on its behalf, it is also jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all FHLBank System consolidated obligations. The Finance Agency, at its discretion, may require any FHLBank to make principal and/or interest payments due on any consolidated obligation, whether or not the primary obligor FHLBank has defaulted on the payment of that consolidated obligation. The Finance Agency has never exercised this discretionary authority. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks was   $967.7 billion   and   $905.2 billion  .

Note 12   Capital 
    
  CAPITAL STOCK 
    
  The Bank's capital stock has a par value of   $100   per share, and all shares are issued, redeemed, or repurchased by the Bank at the stated par value. The Bank generally issues a single class of capital stock (Class B stock). The Bank has   two   subclasses of capital stock: membership and activity-based. Each member must purchase and hold membership capital stock in an amount equal to   0.12 percent   of its total assets as of the preceding December 31   st   , subject to a cap of   $10 million   and a floor of   $10,000  . Each member is also required to purchase activity-based capital stock equal to   4.00 percent   of its advances and mortgage loans outstanding in the Bank's Statements of Condition. All capital stock issued is subject to a   five   year notice of redemption period.  
    
  The capital stock requirements established in the Bank's Capital Plan are designed so that the Bank can remain adequately capitalized as member activity changes. The Bank's Board of Directors may make adjustments to the capital stock requirements within ranges established in the Capital Plan.  
    
  EXCESS STOCK 
    
  Capital stock owned by members in excess of their investment requirement is deemed excess capital stock. Under its Capital Plan, the Bank, at its discretion and upon   15   days' written notice, may repurchase excess membership capital stock. The Bank, at its discretion, may also repurchase excess activity-based capital stock to the extent that (i) the excess capital stock balance exceeds an operational threshold set forth in the Capital Plan, which is currently set at zero, or (ii) a member submits a notice to redeem all or a portion of the excess activity-based capital stock. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had   no   excess capital stock outstanding. 
    
  MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CAPITAL STOCK 
    
  The Bank reclassifies capital stock subject to redemption from equity to a liability (mandatorily redeemable capital stock) at the time shares meet the definition of a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument. This occurs after a member provides written notice of  intention to withdraw from membership, becomes ineligible for continuing membership, or attains non-member status by merger or consolidation, charter termination, or other involuntary termination from membership. Dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock are classified as interest expense in the Statements of Income. 
    
  As a result of the final rule on membership issued by the Finance Agency effective February 19, 2016, the eligibility requirements for FHLBank members were changed rendering captive insurance companies ineligible for FHLBank membership. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members prior to September 12, 2014 (the date the Finance Agency proposed this rule) will have their memberships terminated no later than February 19, 2021. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members after September 12, 2014 will have their memberships terminated no later than February 19, 2017. On the effective date of the final rule, the Bank reclassified   $723 million   of capital stock, the total outstanding capital stock held by all of the Bank's captive insurance companies, to mandatorily redeemable capital stock. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank's mandatorily redeemable capital stock totaled   $675 million   and   $103 million  . During the   three   and   nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock was     $6 million     and     $15 million  . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock was     $1 million   and   $2 million  .

    At the Bank's election, the mandatorily redeemable capital stock may be redeemed prior to the expiration of the five year redemption period that commences on the date of the notice of redemption, or in the case of captive insurance company members, on the date of the membership termination. 
       
           2

The related mandatorily redeemable capital stock is not required to be redeemed until five years after the member's termination.  
       
  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM MERGER 
    
  The Bank recognized the net assets acquired from the Seattle Bank by recording the par value of capital stock issued in the transaction as capital stock, with the remaining portion of net assets acquired reflected in a new capital account captioned as  Additional capital from merger.  The Bank treats this additional capital from merger as a component of total capital for regulatory capital purposes. Dividends on capital stock have been paid from this account since the merger date and the Bank intends to pay future dividends, when and if declared, from this account until the additional capital from merger balance is depleted. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the Bank's additional capital from merger balance totaled   $92 million   and   $194 million  .  
    
  RESTRICTED RETAINED EARNINGS 
    
  The Bank entered into a Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement (JCE Agreement) with all of the other FHLBanks in February 2011. The JCE Agreement, as amended, is intended to enhance the capital position of the Bank over time. It requires the Bank to allocate   20 percent   of its quarterly net income to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the balance of that account equals at least   one percent   of its average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the previous quarter. The restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank's restricted retained earnings account totaled   $200 million   and   $101 million  .

REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
    
  The Bank is subject to   three   regulatory capital requirements: 

Risk-based capital  . The Bank must maintain at all times permanent capital greater than or equal to the sum of its credit, market, and operations risk capital requirements, all calculated in accordance with Finance Agency regulations.     Only permanent capital, defined as Class B stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock), and retained earnings can satisfy this risk-based capital requirement.  

Regulatory capital  . The Bank is required to maintain a minimum   four percent   capital-to-asset ratio, which is defined as total regulatory capital divided by total assets. Total regulatory capital includes Class B stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock), additional capital from merger, and retained earnings. It does not include AOCI.  

Leverage capital  . The Bank is required to maintain a minimum   five percent   leverage ratio, which is defined as the sum of permanent capital weighted   1.5   times and nonpermanent capital weighted   1.0   times, divided by total assets. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , nonpermanent capital included additional capital from merger.  
       
  If the Bank's capital falls below the required levels, the Finance Agency has authority to take actions necessary to return it to levels that it deems to be consistent with safe and sound business operations.

Note 13   Fair Value 
    
  Fair value amounts are determined by the Bank using available market information and reflect the Bank's best judgment of appropriate valuation methods. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The inputs are evaluated and an overall level for the fair value measurement is determined. This overall level is an indication of market observability of the fair value measurement for the asset or liability.  
    
  The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels: 

Level 1 Inputs.   Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the Bank can access on the measurement date. 

Level 2 Inputs.   Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, (iii) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads), and (iv) market-corroborated inputs. 

Level 3 Inputs.   Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
       
  The Bank reviews its fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of the valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of certain assets or liabilities. These reclassifications are reported as transfers in/out as of the beginning of the quarter in which the changes occur. There were no such transfers during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  SUMMARY OF VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND PRIMARY INPUTS    
    
  Cash and Due from Banks.   The fair value equals the carrying value.  
    
  Interest-Bearing Deposits.   For interest-bearing deposits with less than three months to maturity, the fair value approximates the carrying value. For interest-bearing deposits with more than three months to maturity, the fair value is determined by calculating the present value of the expected future cash flows and reducing the amount for accrued interest receivable.  
    
  Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell.   For overnight and term securities purchased under agreements to resell with less than three months to maturity, the fair value approximates the carrying value. For term securities purchased under agreements to resell with more than three months to maturity, the fair value is determined by calculating the present value of the expected future cash flows and reducing the amount for accrued interest receivable. The discount rates used in these calculations are the rates for securities with similar terms.  
    
  Federal Funds Sold.   The fair value approximates the carrying value.

Investment Securities.   The Bank's valuation technique incorporates prices from four designated third-party pricing vendors, when available. The pricing vendors generally use various proprietary models to price investment securities. The inputs to those models are derived from various sources including, but not limited to, benchmark securities and yields, reported trades, dealer estimates, issuer spreads, bids, offers, and other market-related data. Since many investment securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing vendors use available information, as applicable, such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing to determine the prices for individual securities. Each pricing vendor has an established process in place to challenge investment valuations, which facilitates resolution of questionable prices identified by the Bank. Annually, the Bank conducts reviews of the four pricing vendors to confirm and further augment its understanding of the vendors' pricing processes, methodologies, and control procedures for investment securities.  
    
  The Bank's valuation technique for estimating the fair values of its investment securities first requires the establishment of a  median  price for each security. If four prices are received, the average of the middle two prices is the median price; if three prices are received, the middle price is the median price; if two prices are received, the average of the two prices is the median price; and if one price is received, it is the median price (and also the final price) subject to validation of outliers.  
    
  All prices that are within a specified tolerance threshold of the median price are included in the cluster of prices that are averaged to compute a default price. All prices that are outside the threshold (outliers) are subject to further analysis (including, but not limited to, comparison to prices provided by an additional third-party valuation service, prices for similar securities, and/or non-binding dealer estimates) to determine if an outlier is a better estimate of fair value. If an outlier (or some other price identified in the analysis) is determined to be a better estimate of fair value, then the outlier (or the other price as appropriate) is used as the final price rather than the default price. Alternatively, if the analysis confirms that an outlier (or outliers) is (are) in fact not representative of fair value and the default price is the best estimate, then the default price is used as the final price. In all cases, the final price is used to determine the fair value of the security. In limited instances, when no prices are available from the four designated pricing services, the Bank obtains prices from dealers. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , four prices were received for the majority of the Bank's investment securities and the final prices for those securities were computed by averaging the prices received. Based on the Bank's review of the pricing methods and controls employed by the third-party pricing vendors and the relative lack of dispersion among the vendor prices, the Bank believes its final prices are representative of the prices that would have been received if the assets had been sold at the measurement date (i.e., exit prices) and further, that the fair value measurements are classified appropriately in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Advances.   The fair value of advances is determined by calculating the present value of the expected future cash flows and reducing the amount for accrued interest receivable. For advances elected under the fair value option, fair value includes accrued interest receivable. The discount rates used in these calculations are equivalent to the replacement advance rates for advances with similar terms. In accordance with Finance Agency regulations, advances generally require a prepayment fee sufficient to make the Bank financially indifferent to a borrower's decision to prepay the advances. Therefore, the fair value of advances assumes no prepayment risk.  
    
  The Bank uses the following inputs for measuring the fair value of advances: 

Consolidated Obligation Curve (CO Curve)  . The Office of Finance constructs a market-observable curve referred to as the CO Curve. The CO Curve is constructed using the U.S. Treasury Curve as a base curve which is then adjusted by adding indicative spreads obtained largely from market-observable sources. These market indications are generally derived from pricing indications from dealers, historical pricing relationships, recent GSE trades, and secondary market activity. The Bank utilizes the CO Curve as its input to fair value for advances because it represents the Bank's cost of funds and is used to price advances. 

Volatility assumption  . Market-based expectations of future interest rate volatility implied from current market prices for similar options. 

Spread assumption  . Represents a spread adjustment to the CO Curve.  
       
  Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio.   The fair value of mortgage loans held for portfolio is estimated based on quoted market prices of similar mortgage loans available in the market, if available, or modeled prices. The modeled prices start with prices for new MBS issued by GSEs or similar new mortgage loans. The prices are adjusted for credit risk, servicing spreads, seasoning, liquidity, and cash flow remittances. The prices for new MBS or similar new mortgage loans are highly dependent upon the underlying prepayment assumptions priced in the secondary market. Changes in expected prepayment rates often have a material effect on the fair value estimates.  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents     

Impaired Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio.   The fair value of impaired mortgage loans held for portfolio is estimated by obtaining property values from an external pricing vendor. This vendor utilizes multiple pricing models that generally factor in market observable inputs, including actual sales transactions and home price indices. The Bank applies an adjustment to these values to capture certain limitations in the estimation process and takes into consideration estimated selling costs and expected PMI proceeds. In limited instances, the Bank may estimate the fair value of an impaired mortgage loan by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate.   
    
  Real Estate Owned.   The fair value of REO is estimated using a broker price opinion, which considers actual property characteristics and conditions, or a property value from an external pricing vendor. This vendor utilizes multiple pricing models that generally factor in market observable inputs, including actual sales transactions and home price indices. The Bank applies an adjustment to these values to capture certain limitations in the estimation process and takes into consideration estimated selling costs and expected PMI proceeds. 
    
  Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable  . The fair value approximates the carrying value.  
    
  Derivative Assets and Liabilities.   The fair value of derivatives is generally estimated using standard valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses and comparisons to similar instruments. In limited instances, fair value estimates for interest-rate related derivatives may be obtained using an external pricing model that utilizes observable market data. The Bank is subject to credit risk in derivatives transactions due to the potential nonperformance of its derivatives counterparties. The use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral is posted daily, through a clearing agent, for changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives. To mitigate credit risk on uncleared derivatives, the Bank enters into master netting agreements with its counterparties as well as collateral agreements that provide for the delivery of collateral at specified levels tied to those counterparties' credit ratings. The Bank has evaluated the potential for the fair value of its derivatives to be affected by counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk and has determined that no adjustments were significant to the overall fair value measurements. 
    
  The fair values of the Bank's derivative assets and derivative liabilities include accrued interest receivable/payable and cash collateral remitted to/received from counterparties. The estimated fair values of the accrued interest receivable/payable and cash collateral approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature. The fair values of derivatives are netted by clearing agent and/or counterparty if the netting requirements are met. If these netted amounts are positive, they are classified as an asset and, if negative, they are classified as a liability. 
    
  The Bank's discounted cash flow model utilizes market-observable inputs (inputs that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources). The Bank uses the following inputs for measuring the fair value of interest-related derivatives: 

Discount rate assumption  . The Bank utilizes the Overnight-Index Swap (OIS) curve.   

Forward interest rate assumption  . The Bank utilizes the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) swap curve.   

Volatility assumption  . Market-based expectations of future interest rate volatility implied from current market prices for similar options. 
       
  For forward settlement agreements (TBAs), the Bank utilizes TBA securities prices that are determined by coupon class and expected term until settlement. For mortgage delivery commitments, the Bank utilizes TBA securities prices adjusted for factors such as credit risk and servicing spreads. 
    
  Other Assets  . These represent grantor trust assets, which are carried at estimated fair value based on quoted market prices as of the last business day of the reporting period.  
    
  Deposits.   For deposits with three months or less to maturity, the fair value approximates the carrying value. For deposits with more than three months to maturity, the fair value is determined by calculating the present value of the expected future cash flows and reducing the amount for accrued interest payable. The discount rates used in these calculations are the cost of deposits with similar terms.  
    
  Consolidated Obligations.   The fair value of consolidated obligations is determined by calculating the present value of the expected future cash flows and reducing the amount for accrued interest payable. For consolidated obligations elected under the fair value option, fair value includes accrued interest payable. The discount rates used in these calculations are for consolidated obligations with similar terms. The Bank uses the CO Curve and a volatility assumption for measuring the fair value of these consolidated obligations.

Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock.   The fair value of capital stock subject to mandatory redemption is generally reported at par value. Fair value also includes an estimated dividend earned at the time of reclassification from equity to a liability (if applicable), until such amount is paid. Capital stock can only be acquired by members at par value and redeemed at par value. Capital stock is not publicly traded and no market mechanism exists for the exchange of stock outside the cooperative structure.  
    
  Commitments to Fund Advances.   The fair value of advance commitments is based on the present value of fees currently charged for similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. 
    
  Standby Letters of Credit.   The fair value of standby letters of credit is based on either the fees currently charged for similar agreements or the estimated cost to terminate the agreement or otherwise settle the obligation with the counterparty.  
    
  Standby Bond Purchase Agreements  . The fair value of standby bond purchase agreements is calculated using the present value of the expected future fees related to the agreements. The discount rates used in the calculations are based on municipal spreads over the U.S. Treasury Curve, which are comparable to discount rates used to value the underlying bonds. Upon purchase of any bonds under these agreements, the Bank estimates fair value using the "Investment Securities" fair value methodology.  
    
  Subjectivity of Estimates  . Estimates of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the methods previously described are highly subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters, such as the amount and timing of future cash flows, prepayment speed assumptions, expected interest rate volatility, possible distributions of future interest rates used to value options, and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. The use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value estimates.

  FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS 
    
  The Bank measures certain impaired mortgage loans held for portfolio and REO at level 3 fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. The Bank estimates the fair value of these assets based primarily on a broker price opinion or property values from an external pricing vendor. The Bank applies a haircut on these values, which can range between 10 and 20 percent, to capture certain limitations in the estimation process and takes into consideration estimated selling costs of 10 percent and expected PMI proceeds. The following table summarizes outstanding impaired mortgage loans held for portfolio and REO that were recorded at fair value as a result of a non-recurring change in fair value having been recorded in the period then ended (dollars in millions):

FAIR VALUE OPTION 
    
  The fair value option provides an irrevocable option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments not previously carried at fair value. It requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which it has chosen to use fair value on the face of the Statements of Condition. Fair value is used for both the initial and subsequent measurement of the designated assets, liabilities, and commitments, with the changes in fair value recognized in net income.  
    
  The Bank elects the fair value option for certain financial instruments when a hedge relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. These fair value elections are made primarily in an effort to mitigate the potential income statement volatility that can arise when an economic derivative is adjusted for changes in fair value but the related hedged item is not. 
    
  For financial instruments recorded under the fair value option, the related contractual interest income and interest expense are recorded as part of net interest income in the Statements of Income. The remaining changes are recorded as  Net gains (losses) on financial instruments held at fair value  in the Statements of Income. 
    
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, net gains on financial instruments held at fair value (i.e. advances and/or consolidated obligation bonds) were less than $1 million. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Bank determined no credit risk adjustments for nonperformance were necessary to the instruments recorded under the fair value option.  
    
  The following tables summarize the difference between the unpaid principal balance and fair value of outstanding instruments for which the fair value option has been elected (dollars in millions):

Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  Joint and Several Liability  . The FHLBanks have joint and several liability for all consolidated obligations issued. Accordingly, if an FHLBank were unable to repay any consolidated obligation for which it is the primary obligor, each of the other FHLBanks could be called upon by the Finance Agency to repay all or part of such obligations. No FHLBank has ever been asked or required to repay the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank. A  t     September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  , the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations issued on behalf of other FHLBanks for which the Bank is jointly and severally liable was approximately   $801.0 billion   and   $775.2 billion  .  
    
  The following table summarizes additional off-balance sheet commitments for the Bank (dollars in millions): 

Standby Letters of Credit  . A standby letter of credit is a financing arrangement between the Bank and a member. Standby letters of credit are executed with members for a fee. If the Bank is required to make payment for a beneficiary's draw, the payment is withdrawn from the member's demand account. Any resulting overdraft is converted into a collateralized advance to the member. The original terms of standby letters of credit range from less than   one   month to   13   years, currently no later than   2025  . Unearned fees for standby letters of credit are recorded in  Other liabilities  in the Statements of Condition and amounted to   $3 million   and   $2 million   at   September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The Bank monitors the creditworthiness of its standby letters of credit based on an evaluation of its borrowers. The Bank has established parameters for the measurement, review, classification, and monitoring of credit risk related to these standby letters of credit. Based on management's credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not deem it necessary to have any provision for credit losses on these standby letters of credit. All standby letters of credit are fully collateralized at the time of issuance. The estimated fair value of standby letters of credit at   September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015   is reported in  Note 13   Fair Value.  
    
  Standby Bond Purchase Agreements  . The Bank has entered into standby bond purchase agreements with state housing associates within its district whereby, for a fee, it agrees to serve as a standby liquidity provider if required, to purchase and hold the housing associate's bonds until the designated marketing agent can find a suitable investor or the housing associate repurchases the bonds according to a schedule established by the agreement. Each standby bond purchase agreement includes the provisions under which the Bank would be required to purchase the bonds. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had standby bond purchase agreements with   five   housing associates. The standby bond purchase commitments entered into by the Bank have original expiration periods of up to   seven   years, currently no later than   2020  . During both the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank was not required to purchase any bonds under these agreements. For both the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Bank received fees for the guarantees that amounted to less than $1 million. For both the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Bank received fees for the guarantees that amounted to   $1 million  . The estimated fair value of standby bond purchase agreements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     is reported in "  Note 13   Fair Value.  
    
  Commitments to Purchase Mortgage Loans  . The Bank enters into commitments that unconditionally obligate it to purchase mortgage loans from its members. Commitments are generally for periods not to exceed   45   days. These commitments are considered derivatives and their estimated fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is reported in  Note 10   Derivatives and Hedging Activities  as mortgage delivery commitments. 
    
  Commitments to Issue Bonds and Discount Notes  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had commitments to issue   $54 million   of consolidated obligation bonds and no commitments to issue consolidated obligation discount notes. At   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had commitments to issue   $2.5 billion   of consolidated obligation discount notes and no commitments to issue consolidated obligation bonds.

     Table of Contents     

Commitments to Fund Advances.   The Bank enters into commitments that legally bind it to fund additional advances up to 24 months in the future. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had commitments to fund advances of   $294 million   and   $145 million  . 
    
  Other Commitments  . On December 30, 2013, the Bank entered into an agreement with the Iowa Finance Authority (IFA) to purchase up to   $100 million   of taxable multi-family mortgage revenue bonds. As of   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had a commitment to purchase   $87 million   of bonds under the IFA agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank did not have a commitment to purchase bonds as the IFA agreement expired on June 30, 2016. 
    
  The Bank has an FLA memorandum account which is used to track the Bank's potential loss exposure under each MPF master commitment prior to the PFI's credit enhancement obligation. For absorbing certain losses in excess of the FLA, PFIs are paid a credit enhancement fee, a portion of which may be performance-based. To the extent the Bank experiences losses under the FLA, it may be able to recapture performance-based credit enhancement fees paid to the PFI to offset these losses. The FLA balance for all MPF master commitments with a PFI credit enhancement obligation was   $96 million   and   $93 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . For additional information related to the FLA commitment, refer to "Note 9   Allowance for Credit Losses."  
  Legal Proceedings  . As a result of the Merger, the Bank is currently involved in a number of legal proceedings initiated by the Seattle Bank against various entities relating to its purchases and subsequent impairment of certain private-label MBS. Although the Seattle Bank sold all private-label MBS during the first quarter of 2015, the Bank continues to pursue these proceedings. Other than the private-label MBS litigation, the Bank does not believe any legal proceedings to which it is a party could have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  
  Litigation settlement gains are considered realized and recorded when the Bank receives cash or assets that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash or claims to cash. In addition, litigation settlement gains are considered realizable and recorded when the Bank enters into a signed agreement that is not subject to appeal, where the counterparty has the ability to pay, and the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated. Prior to being realized or realizable, the Bank considers potential litigation settlement gains to be gain contingencies, and therefore they are not recorded in the Statements of Income. 
  The Bank records legal expenses related to litigation settlements as incurred in other expenses in the Statements of Income with the exception of certain legal expenses related to litigation settlement awards that are contingent based fees for the attorneys representing the Bank. The Bank incurs and recognizes these contingent based legal fees only when litigation settlement awards are realized, at which time these fees are netted against the gains recognized on the litigation settlement.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Bank recognized and received   $337 million   in net gains on litigation settlements through other income (loss), due to the settlement of certain private-label MBS claims. The Bank did not recognize any net gains on litigation settlements during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  During both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Bank recognized   $12 million   in net gains on litigation settlements. 

Note 15   Activities with Stockholders    
    
  The Bank is a cooperative whose current members own nearly all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank. Former members own the remaining capital stock to support business transactions still carried on the Bank's Statements of Condition. All stockholders, including current and former members, may receive dividends on their capital stock investment to the extent declared by the Bank's Board of Directors. 
    
  TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTORS' FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Bank extends credit to its members whose directors and officers serve as Bank directors (Directors' Financial Institutions). Finance Agency regulations require that transactions with Directors' Financial Institutions be made on the same terms and conditions as those with any other member.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  Our Bank is a member-owned cooperative serving shareholder members in our district. Our mission is to be a reliable provider of funding, liquidity, and services for our members so that they can meet the housing, business, and economic development needs of the communities they serve. We strive to achieve our mission within an operating principle that balances the trade-off between attractively priced products, reasonable returns on capital stock, and maintaining adequate capital to support safe and sound business operations. Our members include commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, insurance companies, and community development financial institutions (CDFIs).   
    
  Financial Results 
  On May 31, 2015, we completed the merger (the Merger) with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (Seattle Bank). The Merger had a significant impact on all aspects of our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. As a result, the financial results for the current period are not directly comparable to the financial results prior to the Merger. 
    
  For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we reported net income of   $74 million   and   $493 million   compared to   $39 million   and   $100 million   for the same periods in   2015  . Our net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was boosted by   $337 million   of net gains on litigation settlements. We did not record any litigation settlement gains in the quarter ending September 30, 2016. 
    
  The litigation settlements are the result of settlements with certain defendants in the our private-label MBS litigation. As a result of the Merger, we are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings initiated by the Seattle Bank against various entities relating to its purchases and subsequent impairments of certain private-label MBS. Although the Seattle Bank sold all private-label MBS during the first quarter of 2015, we continue to pursue these proceedings. We did not record any gains on litigation settlements during the three months ended September 30, 2016. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded net gains on litigation settlements of $12 million. 
    
  Net interest income totaled   $117 million   and   $314 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $88 million   and   $236 million   for the same periods last year. The increases were primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from the higher interest rate environment and higher average advance and investment volumes, a portion of which for the year-to-date period was attributable to the assets acquired in the Merger. Our net interest margin was   0.27 percent   and   0.26 percent   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.29 percent   for both the three and   nine   months ended September 30, 2015. The decline was primarily due to increased costs on our interest-bearing liabilities driven by the higher interest rate environment and higher average volumes of advances which generate lower margins when compared to our other interest-earning assets. 
    
  We recorded a loss of   $5 million   and income of   $319 million   in other income (loss) for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to losses of   $12 million   and   $15 million   for the same periods last year. Other income (loss) included litigation settlements which were the primary driver of the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as discussed above. Other factors impacting other income (loss) include net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities and net gains (losses) on trading securities, as described below. 
    
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net losses of   $3 million   and   $76 million   on our derivatives and hedging activities through other income (loss) compared to net losses of   $43 million   and   $39 million   during the same periods last year. These fair value changes were primarily attributable to the impact of changes in interest rates on interest rate swaps that we utilize to hedge our investment securities portfolio. We utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk, including mortgage prepayment risk. Accounting rules require all derivatives to be recorded at fair value and therefore we may be subject to income statement volatility. Refer to "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Results of Operations   Hedging Activities" for additional discussion on our derivatives and hedging activities, including the net impact of economic hedge relationships.

During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net losses on trading securities of   $2 million   and net gains of   $51 million   compared to net gains of   $17 million   and   $9 million   during the same periods in   2015  . These changes in fair value were primarily due to the impact of interest rates and credit spreads on our fixed rate trading securities and were generally offset by changes in fair value on derivatives that we utilize to economically hedge these securities. Trading securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected through other income (loss).  
    
  Other expense totaled   $28 million   and   $82 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $32 million   and   $108 million   for the same periods last year. The decrease was primarily due to one time merger related expenses incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Merger related expenses primarily included compensation and benefit expenses and merger transaction and integration expenses.  
       
  Our total assets increased to   $176.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $137.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , due primarily to a $36.7 billion increase in advances. Advances increased due to borrowings from a wide range of members with the most significant increase from a large depository institution member.  
    
  Our total liabilities increased to   $169.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $131.8 billion   at December 31, 2015, due primarily to an increase in consolidated obligations issued to fund the growth in our assets.  
    
  Total capital increased to   $7.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $5.6 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Total capital was impacted by an increase in retained earnings and an increase in capital stock. Retained earnings   increased   to   $1.3 billion   due to net income earned. Capital stock   increased   due to increased member activity which was partially offset by the reclassification of $0.7 billion of capital stock, including all capital stock outstanding to captive insurance companies, to mandatorily redeemable capital stock. This capital stock reclassification was in response to the Finance Agency final rule affecting captive insurance company membership that became effective on February 19, 2016. 
    
  Total regulatory capital increased to $7.7 billion at September 30, 2016, from $5.8 billion at December 31, 2015, both of which were above the required regulatory minimum. Regulatory capital includes all capital stock, mandatorily redeemable capital stock, additional capital from merger, and retained earnings. 
    
  Refer to  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Statements of Condition  for additional discussion on our financial condition. 
    
  Adjusted Earnings 
    
  As part of evaluating financial performance, we adjust GAAP net interest income and GAAP net income before assessments  for the impact of (i) market adjustments relating to derivative and hedging activities and instruments held at fair value, (ii) realized gains (losses) on investment securities, and (iii) other non-routine and unpredictable items, including net asset prepayment fee income, debt extinguishment losses, merger related expenses, mandatorily redeemable capital stock interest expense, and net gains on litigation settlements. The resulting non-GAAP measure, referred to as our adjusted earnings, reflects both adjusted net interest income and adjusted net income before assessments.  
    
  Because our business model is primarily one of holding assets and liabilities to maturity, management believes that the adjusted earnings measure is helpful in understanding our operating results and provides a meaningful period-to-period comparison of our long-term economic value in contrast to GAAP results, which can be impacted by fair value changes driven by market volatility on financial instruments recorded at fair value or transactions that are considered to be unpredictable or not routine. As a result, management uses the adjusted earnings measure to assess performance under our incentive compensation plans and to ensure management remains focused on our long-term value and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. While these non-GAAP measures can be used to assist in understanding the components of our earnings, they should not be considered a substitute for results reported under GAAP.   
    
  As indicated in the tables that follow, our adjusted net interest income and adjusted net income before assessments increased during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in   2015  . The increase in our adjusted net interest income and adjusted net income before assessments was primarily due to an increase in interest income due to the higher interest rate environment and higher advance and investment volumes, a portion of which were acquired through the Merger.

CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS 
    
  Economy and Financial Markets 
    
  Economic and market data received since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee) meeting in July of   2016   indicates that economic activity has picked up from the moderate pace witnessed in the first half of the year. The labor market has continued to strengthen and job gains have been solid, however the unemployment rate has seen little change in recent months. Growth in household spending and the housing sector strengthened, however business fixed investments remain soft. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective of two percent, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices. Market-based measurements of inflation adjusted compensation remained low and long-term inflation expectations have remained stable.  
    
  In its September 21, 2016 statement, the FOMC stated it expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further toward levels the FOMC judges consistent with its dual mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability. In addition, the FOMC stated it anticipates that inflation will remain low in the near term, but it anticipates inflation will rise gradually towards its two percent objective over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate. The FOMC will continue to monitor inflation and global economic and financial developments closely. 
    
  Mortgage Markets 
    
  The housing market continued to improve throughout the third quarter of 2016, although slower than during the first half of the year, as indicated by rising home prices, lower inventories of properties for sale, increased housing construction activity, and increased sales of existing homes. The improvement in the housing market has been partly attributable to the continued strengthening of the economy and partly due to the seasonality of home sales. The outlook for a sustainable recovery in residential sales and home prices remains promising over the long term, as consumer sentiment continues to improve and first time home buyer activity improves. Many market participants, however, expect this recovery to occur at a slower pace than in previous years. 
    
  Mortgage rates remained low throughout the third quarter, which has resulted in an increase in refinancing volume and has stimulated additional demand for home purchases as the cost of debt has made homes more affordable. 
    
  Interest Rates 
    
  The following table shows information on key market interest rates   1   :

     Table of Contents     

In its December 2015 meeting, the FOMC increased the Federal Reserve's key target interest rate, the Federal funds rate, to a range of 0.25 to 0.50 percent and maintained this range throughout the third quarter of 2016 compared to a range of 0.00 to 0.25 percent for the same period in 2015. In its September 21, 2016 statement, the FOMC reaffirmed that the current exceptionally low target range for the Federal funds rate remains appropriate. The FOMC stated that it will assess progress towards its longer-run goals of maximum employment and a two percent inflation rate. The assessment will take into account measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures, inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. The Committee anticipates it will be appropriate to increase the target range for the Federal funds rate when information indicates continued improvement in the labor market and the Committee is reasonably confident inflation will move back to its two percent objective. 
    
  Following the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union at the end of the second quarter, interest rates remained lower throughout the third quarter. 
    
  The 10-year U.S. Treasury yields and mortgage rates were lower on average in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to prior year. Interest rates declined as concerns of growth and declines in commodity prices have impacted markets globally. While the FOMC considers removing monetary policy accommodation as data warrants, foreign central banks have continued to ease monetary policy further in 2016. 
    
  In its September 21, 2016 statement, the FOMC stated that it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBS into agency MBS and of rolling over maturing U.S. Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the Federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. 
    
  Funding Spreads  
    
  The following table reflects our funding spreads to LIBOR (basis points)   1   :

    Source is the Office of Finance. 
       
  As a result of our credit quality, we generally have ready access to funding at relatively competitive interest rates. During the third quarter of 2016, our short-term funding spreads relative to London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) improved when compared to spreads at   December 31, 2015   as investor demand increased with market volatility and in response to money market reform. During the first nine months of   2016  , we utilized consolidated obligation discount notes in addition to step-up, callable, and term fixed and floating rate consolidated obligation bonds to capture attractive funding, match the repricing structures on advances, and meet liquidity requirements. Spreads relative to LIBOR deteriorated on long-term debt as investor demand remained focused on short-term maturities.

Net Interest Income 
    
  Our net interest income is impacted by changes in average interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability balances, and the related yields. The following table presents average balances and rates of major asset and liability categories (dollars in millions):       

1 
    Average balances are calculated on a daily weighted average basis and do not reflect the effect of derivative master netting arrangements with counterparties and/or clearing agents. 
       
           2 
    The average balance of AFS securities is reflected at amortized cost; therefore the resulting yields do not give effect to changes in fair value. 
       
           3 
    Average balances reflect the impact of fair value hedging adjustments and/or fair value option adjustments. 
       
           4 
    MBS interest income includes net prepayment fee income of less than $1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of an AFS MBS prepayment. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, MBS interest income includes net prepayment fee income of $2 million. 
       
           5 
    Other investments primarily include U.S. Treasury obligations, other U.S. obligations, government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) obligations, Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, and taxable municipal bonds. 
       
           6 
    Advance interest income includes prepayment fee income of   $1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . Advance prepayment fees were less than $1 million for the three months ended September 30,   2015  . 
       
           7 
    Non-accrual loans are included in the average balance used to determine the average yield.

The following table presents changes in interest income and interest expense. Changes in interest income and interest expense that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but rather equally attributable to both volume and rate changes, are allocated to the volume and rate categories based on the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes (dollars in millions). 

NET INTEREST SPREAD 
    
  Net interest spread equals the yield on total interest-earning assets minus the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our net interest spread was   0.24 percent   and   0.23 percent   compared to   0.27 percent   for both the three and nine months ended September 30,   2015  . Our net interest spread was primarily impacted by a higher cost on total interest-bearing liabilities, which was partially offset by a higher yield on total interest-earning assets. The primary components of our interest income and interest expense are discussed below.  
    
  Advances 
    
  Interest income on advances (including prepayment fees on advances, net)   increase  d during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in   2015   due primarily to higher average volumes and the higher interest rate environment. Average advance volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased primarily due to borrowings from a large depository institution member. Average advance volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased due to an increase in borrowings from a wide range of members with the most significant increase from a large depository institution. Average advance volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 also increased due to advances acquired as a result of the Merger. 
    
  Investments 
    
  Interest income on investments   increase  d during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in   2015  . Interest income on investments increased during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the higher interest rate environment. Interest income on investments increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily to higher average investment volumes due in part to the acquisition of MBS and non-MBS investments as a result of the Merger.

     Table of Contents     

Mortgage Loans 
    
  Interest income on mortgage loans decreased during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in   2015   due to a decline in mortgage interest rates which resulted in an increase in mortgage loan refinancing activity. Interest income on mortgage loans also decreased due to lower average mortgage loan volumes due to principal payments exceeding mortgage loan purchases.  
    
  Discount Notes 
    
  Interest expense on discount notes   increase  d during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in   2015   due to the higher interest rate environment and higher average volumes. Discount notes were utilized to capture attractive funding, match repricing structures on advances, and provide additional liquidity.  
    
  Bonds 
    
  Interest expense on bonds   increase  d during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the same periods in   2015   due primarily to higher average bond volumes. The increase in average volumes was primarily due to our increased utilization of bonds to capture attractive funding, match repricing structures on short-term and variable rate callable advances, and provide additional liquidity. 
    
  Other Interest-Bearing Liabilities 
    
    Interest expense on other interest-bearing liabilities increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same periods in   2015   due to higher interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The average mandatorily redeemable capital stock balance increased as a result of the reclassification of $0.7 billion of capital stock, including all capital stock outstanding to captive insurance companies, to mandatorily redeemable capital stock during the year. This capital stock reclassification was in response to the Finance Agency final rule affecting captive insurance company membership effective February 19, 2016. 

Other Income (Loss) 
    
  The following table summarizes the components of other income (loss) (dollars in millions):  

Other income (loss) can be volatile from period to period depending on the type of activity recorded. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , other income (loss) was primarily impacted by net gains on litigation settlements of   $337 million   as a result of settlements with certain defendants in our private-label MBS litigation. In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, other income (loss) was impacted by net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities and net gains (losses) on trading securities.  
    
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net losses of   $3 million   and   $76 million   on our derivatives and hedging activities through other income (loss) compared to net losses of   $43 million   and   $39 million   during the same periods in   2015  . These fair value changes were primarily attributable to the impact of changes in interest rates on interest rate swaps that we utilize to hedge our investment securities portfolio. We use derivatives to manage interest rate risk, including mortgage prepayment risk. Refer to  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Results of Operations   Hedging Activities  for additional discussion on our derivatives and hedging activities, including the net impact of economic hedge relationships.

     Table of Contents     

During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net losses on trading securities of   $2 million   and net gains of   $51 million   compared to net gains of   $17 million   and   $9 million   during the same periods in   2015  . These changes in fair value were primarily due to the impact of interest rates and credit spreads on our fixed rate trading securities which are generally offset by the changes in fair value on derivatives that we utilize to economically hedge these securities. Trading securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected through other income (loss).  

Hedging Activities  
    
  We use derivatives to manage interest rate risk, including mortgage prepayment risk, in our Statements of Condition. Accounting rules affect the timing and recognition of income and expense on derivatives and therefore we may be subject to income statement volatility. 
    
  If a hedging activity qualifies for hedge accounting treatment (fair value hedge), we include the periodic cash flow components of the derivative related to interest income or expense in the relevant income statement caption consistent with the hedged asset or liability. We also record the amortization of fair value hedging adjustments from terminated hedges and the amortization of the financing element of our off market derivatives in interest income or expense or other income (loss). Changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item are recorded as a component of other income (loss) in  Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities."  
    
  If a hedging activity does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (economic hedge), we record the derivative's components of interest income and expense, together with the effect of changes in fair value as a component of other income (loss) in  Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities  however, there is no fair value adjustment for the corresponding asset or liability being hedged unless changes in the fair value of the asset or liability are normally marked to fair value through earnings (i.e., trading securities and fair value option instruments).

    The hedging activity tables do not include the interest component on the related hedged items or the gross prepayment fee income on terminated advance or investment hedge relationships. 

NET AMORTIZATION/ACCRETION  
    
  Amortization/accretion varies from period to period depending on our hedge relationship termination activities and the maturity, call, or prepayment of assets or liabilities previously in hedge relationships. In addition, amortization is impacted by the financing element of our off market derivatives. 
    
  NET INTEREST SETTLEMENTS  
    
  Net interest settlements represent the interest component on derivatives that qualify for fair value hedge accounting. These amounts vary from period to period depending on our hedging activities and interest rates and are partially offset by the interest component on the related hedged item within net interest income. The hedging activity tables do not include the impact of the interest component on the related hedged item.

GAINS (LOSSES) ON FAIR VALUE HEDGES  
    
  Gains (losses) on fair value hedges are driven by hedge ineffectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness occurs when changes in the fair value of the derivative and the related hedged item do not perfectly offset each other. The factors that affect hedge ineffectiveness include changes in the benchmark interest rate, volatility, and the divergence in the valuation curves used to value our assets, liabilities, and derivatives.  
    
  GAINS (LOSSES) ON ECONOMIC HEDGES  
    
  We utilize economic derivatives to manage certain risks in our Statements of Condition. Gains and losses on economic derivatives are driven primarily by changes in interest rates and volatility and include interest settlements. Interest settlements represent the interest component on economic derivatives. These amounts vary from period to period depending on our hedging activities and interest rates. The following discussion highlights key items impacting gains and losses on investment economic derivatives. 
    
  Investments 
    
  We utilize interest rate swaps to economically hedge a portion of our trading securities against changes in fair value. Gains and losses on these economic derivatives are due primarily to changes in interest rates. Gains and losses on our trading securities are also due primarily to changes in interest rates and credit spreads.  
    
  The following table summarizes gains and losses on these economic derivatives as well as the related trading securities (dollars in millions): 

Other Expense 
  The following table shows the components of other expense (dollars in millions): 

Other expense totaled   $28 million   and   $82 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $32 million   and   $108 million   for the same periods last year. The decrease was primarily due to one time merger related expenses incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the Merger. Merger related expenses primarily included compensation and benefits expenses and Merger transaction and integration expenses.

STATEMENTS OF CONDITION 

Financial Highlights  
    
  Our total assets increased to   $176.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $137.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Our total liabilities increased to   $169.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $131.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Total capital increased to   $7.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $5.6 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . See further discussion of changes in our financial condition in the appropriate sections that follow.  

Cash and Due from Banks 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our total cash balance was   $0.2 billion   compared to   $1.0 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Our cash balance was high at the end of 2015 due to limited investment opportunities.  

Advances  
    
  The following table summarizes our advances by type of institution (dollars in millions): 

Our total advance par value increased   $36.6 billion   or   41 percent   at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015  . The increase in total par value was due to an increase in borrowings from a wide range of members with the most significant increase from a large depository institution member.  
    
  The following table summarizes our advances by product type (dollars in millions):  

Fair value hedging adjustments changed   $76 million   or   53 percent   at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015   due primarily to an increase in cumulative fair value adjustments on advances in hedge relationships resulting from changes in interest rates.

     Table of Contents     

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , 62 and 61 percent of our advances were variable rate callable advances. Callable advances may be prepaid by borrowers on pertinent dates (call dates) and therefore provide borrowers a source of long-term financing with prepayment flexibility. Interest rates on our variable rate callable advances reset at each call date to be consistent with either the underlying LIBOR index or our current offering rate in line with our underlying cost of funds. In addition, we retain the flexibility to adjust the spread relative to our cost of funds for the majority of these variable rate advances on each reset date. We generally fund our variable rate callable advances with either discount notes, LIBOR indexed debt, or debt swapped to a LIBOR index. For additional discussion on our funding strategies, refer to "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    Liquidity and Capital Resources    Liquidity    Sources of Liquidity.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , advances outstanding to our five largest member borrowers totaled   $83.9 billion   and   $50.5 billion  , representing   67   and   57 percent   of our total advances outstanding. The following table summarizes advances outstanding to our five largest member borrowers at   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions):

           2 
    Represents a captive insurance company member whose membership will terminate within five years of the Finance Agency's final rule on membership that became effective February 19, 2016. 

On January 20, 2016, the Finance Agency issued a final rule effective February 19, 2016 that changes the eligibility requirements for FHLBank members by rendering captive insurance companies ineligible for FHLBank membership. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members prior to September 12, 2014 (the date the Finance Agency proposed this rule) will have their memberships terminated no later than February 19, 2021. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members after September 12, 2014 will have their memberships terminated no later than February 19, 2017. As of September 30, 2016, we had 12 captive insurance company members with advances outstanding of $14.7 billion, which represented 12 percent of our total advances outstanding. Of our captive insurance company members, six members with advance balances outstanding of $11.1 billion will have their membership terminated within five years of the effective date of the final rule and six members with advance balances outstanding of $3.6 billion will have their membership terminated within one year of the effective date, according to the final rule. As indicated in the table above, three of our top five largest member borrowers are captive insurance company members. The magnitude of the impact of the final rule will depend, in part, on our size and profitability at the time of membership termination or maturity of the related advances.  
    
  We manage our credit exposure to advances through an approach that provides for an established credit limit for each borrower, ongoing reviews of each borrower's financial condition, and detailed collateral and lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers' needs for a reliable source of funding. In addition, we lend to our borrowers in accordance with the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 (FHLBank Act), Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency) regulations, and other applicable laws and regulations.  
    
  The FHLBank Act requires that we obtain sufficient collateral on advances to protect against losses. We have never experienced a credit loss on an advance to a member or eligible housing associate. Based upon our collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on advances, management has determined that there were no probable credit losses on our advances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Accordingly, we have not recorded any allowance for credit losses on our advances. See additional discussion regarding our collateral requirements in  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Risk Management   Credit Risk   Advances.

Investments 
    
  The following table summarizes the carrying value of our investments (dollars in millions):    

1 
    Short-term investments have original maturities equal to or less than one year. 
       
           2 
    Long-term investments have original maturities of greater than one year. 
       
           3 
    Represents investment securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. 
       
  Our investments increased   $2.7 billion   or   7 percent   at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015  . The increase was due in part to the purchase of money market investments and agency MBS securities during the year. 
    
  The Finance Agency limits our investments in MBS by requiring that the total book value of our MBS not exceed three times regulatory capital at the time of purchase. At   September 30, 2016  , our ratio of MBS to regulatory capital was 2.69. At   December 31, 2015  , our ratio of MBS to regulatory capital was 3.23 due to the Merger, and as a result, we were precluded from purchasing any additional MBS until this ratio fell below 3.00. 
    
  We evaluate AFS and HTM securities in an unrealized loss position for other-than-temporary-impairment (OTTI) on at least a quarterly basis. As part of our OTTI evaluation, we consider our intent to sell each debt security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions is met, we will recognize an OTTI charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the reporting date. For securities in an unrealized loss position that meet neither of these conditions, we perform analyses to determine if any of these securities are other-than-temporarily impaired.  
    
  Refer to  Item 1. Financial Statements    Note 6   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment  for additional information on our OTTI analysis performed at   September 30, 2016  . As a result of our analysis, we determined that all gross unrealized losses on our investment portfolio were temporary. We do not intend to sell these securities, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases. As a result, we did not consider any of these securities to be other-than-temporarily-impaired at   September 30, 2016  .

Consolidated Obligations  
    
  Consolidated obligations, which include bonds and discount notes, are the primary source of funds to support our advances, mortgage loans, and investments. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of consolidated obligations for which we are primarily liable totaled   $166.9 billion   and   $130.2 billion  .  
    
  DISCOUNT NOTES 
    
  The following table summarizes our discount notes, all of which are due within one year (dollars in millions):    

1 
    Concessions represent fees paid to dealers in connection with the issuance of certain consolidated obligation discount notes. 
          
  Our discount notes decreased   $14.5 billion   or   15 percent   at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to our use of bonds in place of discount notes to manage our funding needs throughout the third quarter. For additional information on our discount notes, refer to  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Liquidity   Sources of Liquidity.  
    
  BONDS 
    
  The following table summarizes information on our bonds (dollars in millions):  

1 
    Concessions represent fees paid to dealers in connection with the issuance of certain consolidated obligation bonds. 
       
  Our bonds increased   $51.2 billion     or     164 percent     at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to our utilization of bonds to capture attractive funding, match repricing structures on short-term and variable rate advances, and to provide additional liquidity. Fair value hedging adjustments changed   $39 million   or   122 percent   at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015     due primarily to an increase in cumulative fair value adjustments on bonds in hedge relationships resulting from changes in interest rates. 
    
  For additional information on our bonds, refer to "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Liquidity   Sources of Liquidity.  

Deposits 
    
  Deposit levels will vary based on member alternatives for short-term investments. Our deposits decreased   $77 million   or   7 percent   at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015   due primarily to a decrease in non-interest-bearing deposits.

Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock 
    
  We reclassify capital stock subject to redemption from equity to a liability (mandatorily redeemable capital stock) at the time shares meet the definition of a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument. This occurs after a member provides written notice of redemption, gives notice of intention to withdraw from membership, becomes ineligible for continuing membership, or attains non-member status by merger or consolidation, charter termination, or other involuntary termination from membership. 
    
  Our total mandatorily redeemable capital stock balance increased   $572 million   at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015   due primarily to the reclassification of $723 million in captive insurance company capital stock to mandatorily redeemable capital stock in the first quarter of 2016 in response to the Finance Agency final rule affecting membership eligibility that became effective February 19, 2016. The final rule changed the eligibility requirements for FHLBank members by rendering captive insurance companies ineligible for FHLBank membership. According to the final rule, captive insurance company members that were admitted as members prior to September 12, 2014 (the date the Finance Agency proposed this rule) will have their memberships terminated no later than February 19, 2021. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members after September 12, 2014 will have their memberships terminated no later than February 19, 2017. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our mandatorily redeemable capital stock totaled   $675 million   and   $103 million  .  

Capital 
    
  The following table summarizes information on our capital (dollars in millions):  

Our capital increased   $1.4 billion   or   25 percent   at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015  . The increase was due to an increase in capital stock and retained earnings. Capital stock increased   $944 million   due to an increase in member activity, partially offset by the reclassification of $732 million of capital stock, including all capital stock outstanding to captive insurance company members, to mandatorily redeemable capital stock. Retained earnings increased   $493 million   due to net income earned. Refer to  Item 2.

Derivatives  
    
  We use derivatives to manage interest rate risk, including mortgage prepayment risk, in our Statements of Condition. The notional amount of derivatives serves as a factor in determining periodic interest payments and cash flows received and paid. However, the notional amount of derivatives represents neither the actual amounts exchanged nor our overall exposure to credit and market risk.  
    
  The following table categorizes the notional amount of our derivatives by type (dollars in millions):  

The notional amount of our derivative contracts increased $11.8 billion or 30 percent at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015  . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we increased our utilization of swapped consolidated obligation bonds in addition to discount notes to capture attractive funding, match repricing structures on advances, and provide additional liquidity. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Our liquidity and capital positions are actively managed in an effort to preserve stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds to meet current and projected future operating financial commitments, as well as regulatory, liquidity, and capital requirements.  
    
  Liquidity 
    
  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY 
    
  We utilize several sources of liquidity to carry out our business activities. These include, but are not limited to, proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations, payments collected on advances and mortgage loans, proceeds from the maturity or sale of investment securities, member deposits, proceeds from the issuance of capital stock, and current period earnings. 
    
  Our primary source of liquidity is proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations (bonds and discount notes) in the capital markets. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , proceeds from the issuance of bonds and discount notes were   $77.9 billion   and   $209.4 billion   compared to   $15.6 billion   and   $198.1 billion   for the same period in   2015  . We continued to issue shorter-term discount notes as well as step-up, callable, and term fixed and floating rate consolidated obligation bonds to capture attractive funding, match repricing structures on advances and investments, and provide additional liquidity.  
    
  We maintained continual access to funding and adapted our debt issuance to meet the needs of our members, including demand for variable rate callable advance products that generally favored the issuance of shorter-term debt. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable as investors have sought the FHLBanks' short-term debt as an asset of choice, which has led to advantageous funding opportunities and increased utilization of consolidated obligation short-term bonds as well as discount notes. However, due to the short-term maturity of the debt, we may be exposed to additional risks associated with refinancing and our ability to access the capital markets.  
  
   76 

     Table of Contents     

We monitor our debt refinancing risk and continue to enhance our liquidity and funding management. In measuring the level of assets requiring refinancing, we consider the maturity characteristics of our assets and liabilities. The following table presents the composition of our assets and liabilities by maturity (dollars in millions):  

1 
    Represents the principal balance of interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, Federal funds sold, trading securities, AFS securities, and HTM securities. MBS and asset-backed investments are based on expected maturity, which factors in projected prepayments; all other investments are based on contractual maturity. Certain assumptions are factored into the greater than one year bucket as they are not monitored as part of the maturity gap. 
       
           2 
    Represents the principal balance of advances based on contractual maturity. At September 30, 2016, 63 percent of our advances are callable, many of which have call dates in the next year. For further detail of our advance call dates, refer to "Item 1. Financial Statements   Note 7   Advances".  
       
           3 
    Represents the principal balance of MPF and MPP mortgage loans based on expected maturity, which factors in projected prepayments. Certain assumptions are factored into the greater than one year bucket as they are not monitored as part of the maturity gap. 
       
           4 
    Represents all other assets or liabilities reflected in the Bank's Statement of Condition that are not monitored as part of the maturity gap. 
       
           5 
    Represents the principal balance of consolidated obligations based on contractual maturity.  
       
           6 
    The maturity gap percentage is calculated as the maturity gap divided by total assets. 
       
  We monitor the maturity gap between assets and liabilities and are currently striving to reduce our maturity gap percentage to reduce the level of refinancing risk that could potentially occur if we could not obtain funding in the capital markets due to an unforeseen event. This can be accomplished by shortening the maturity of our assets and/or lengthening the maturity of our liabilities. Our maturity gap objective and the time period for achieving this may vary based on a number of factors including our member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors. 
    
  Our ability to raise funds in the capital markets as well as our cost of borrowing may be affected by our credit ratings. As of   October 31, 2016  , our consolidated obligations were rated AA+/A-1+ by Standard and Poor's and Aaa/P-1 by Moody's and both ratings had a stable outlook. For further discussion of how credit rating changes and our ability to access the capital markets may impact us in the future, refer to  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
    
  Although we are primarily liable for the portion of consolidated obligations which are issued on our behalf, we are also jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all consolidated obligations issued by the FHLBank System. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations for which we are primarily liable was   $166.7 billion   and   $130.0 billion  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total par value of outstanding consolidated obligations issued on behalf of other FHLBanks for which we are jointly and severally liable was approximately   $801.0 billion   and   $775.2 billion  .  
    
  The Office of Finance and FHLBanks have contingency plans in place that prioritize the allocation of proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations during periods of financial distress if consolidated obligations cannot be issued in sufficient amounts to satisfy all FHLBank demand. In the event of significant market disruptions or local disasters, our President or his designee is authorized to establish interim borrowing relationships with other FHLBanks. To provide further access to funding, the FHLBank Act also authorizes the U.S. Treasury to directly purchase new issue consolidated obligations of the GSEs, including FHLBanks, up to an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. As of   October 31, 2016  , no purchases had been made by the U.S. Treasury under this authorization.

USES OF LIQUIDITY 
    
  We use our available liquidity, including proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations, primarily to repay consolidated obligations, fund advances, and purchase investments. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , repayments of consolidated obligations totaled   $250.6 billion   compared to   $216.2 billion   for the same period in   2015  . A portion of these payments were due to the call of certain bonds in an effort to better match our projected asset cash flows. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we called bonds with a total par value of   $1.6 billion   and $13.9 billion. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , advance disbursements totaled   $171.2 billion   compared to   $88.5 billion   for the same period in   2015  . The increase was due to borrowings from a wide range of members with the most significant increase from a large depository institution member. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , investment purchases (excluding overnight investments) totaled   $88.7 billion   compared to   $112.1 billion   for the same period in   2015  . Investment purchases during each period were primarily driven by the purchase of money market investments, including secured resale agreements in an effort to manage our liquidity position. 
    
  We also use liquidity to purchase mortgage loans, repay member deposits, pledge collateral to derivative counterparties, redeem or repurchase capital stock, pay expenses, and pay dividends.  
    
  LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS 
  Finance Agency regulations mandate three liquidity requirements. First, we are required to maintain contingent liquidity sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, which shall, at a minimum, cover five calendar days of inability to access the consolidated obligation debt markets. Second, we are required to have available at all times an amount greater than or equal to members' current deposits invested in advances with maturities not to exceed five years, deposits in banks or trust companies, and obligations of the U.S. Treasury. Third, we are required to maintain, in the aggregate, unpledged qualifying assets in an amount at least equal to the amount of our participation in total consolidated obligations outstanding. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we were in compliance with all three of the Finance Agency liquidity requirements. 
  In addition to the liquidity measures previously discussed, the Finance Agency has provided us with guidance to maintain sufficient liquidity in an amount at least equal to our anticipated cash outflows under two different scenarios. One scenario (roll-off scenario) assumes that we cannot access the capital markets to issue debt for a period of 10 to 20 days with initial guidance set at 15 days and that during that time members do not renew any maturing, prepaid, and called advances. The second scenario (renew scenario) assumes that we cannot access the capital markets to issue debt for a period of three to seven days with initial guidance set at five days and that during that time we will automatically renew maturing and called advances for all members except very large, highly-rated members. This guidance is designed to protect against temporary disruptions in the debt markets that could lead to a reduction in market liquidity and thus the inability for us to provide advances to our members. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we were in compliance with this liquidity guidance.  
  Capital  
    
  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
    
  We are subject to three regulatory capital requirements. First, the FHLBank Act requires that we maintain at all times permanent capital greater than or equal to the sum of our credit, market, and operations risk capital requirements, all calculated in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. Only permanent capital, defined as Class B capital stock, (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock), and retained earnings can satisfy this risk-based capital requirement. Second, the FHLBank Act requires a minimum four percent capital-to-asset ratio, which is defined as total regulatory capital divided by total assets. Total regulatory capital includes Class B capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock), additional capital from merger, and retained earnings. It does not include accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Third, the FHLBank Act imposes a five percent minimum leverage ratio, which is defined as the sum of permanent capital weighted 1.5 times and nonpermanent capital weighted 1.0 times, divided by total assets. Nonpermanent capital includes additional capital from merger. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we were in compliance with all three of the Finance Agency's regulatory capital requirements. Refer to "Item 1. Financial Statements   Note 12   Capital" for additional information.

CAPITAL STOCK 
  Our capital stock has a par value of $100 per share, and all shares are issued, redeemed, and repurchased only at the stated par value. We generally issue a single class of capital stock (Class B stock). We have two subclasses of Class B capital stock: membership and activity-based. Each member must purchase and hold membership capital stock in an amount equal to 0.12 percent of its total assets as of the preceding December 31   st   , subject to a cap of $10.0 million and a floor of $10,000. Each member is also required to purchase activity-based capital stock equal to 4.00 percent of its advances and mortgage loans outstanding. All Class B capital issued is subject to a five year notice of redemption period. 
    
  We reclassify capital stock subject to redemption from equity to a liability (mandatorily redeemable capital stock) when a member provides written notice of redemption, gives notice of intention to withdraw from membership, becomes ineligible for continuing membership, or attains non-member status by merger or consolidation, charter termination, or other involuntary termination from membership. 
    
  The capital stock requirements established in our Capital Plan are designed so that we remain adequately capitalized as member activity changes. Our Board of Directors may make adjustments to the capital stock requirements within ranges established in our Capital Plan.  
    
  Capital stock owned by members in excess of their capital stock requirement is deemed excess capital stock. Under our Capital Plan, we, at our discretion and upon 15 days' written notice, may repurchase excess membership capital stock. We, at our discretion, may also repurchase excess activity-based capital stock to the extent that (i) the excess capital stock balance exceeds an operational threshold set forth in the Capital Plan, which is currently set at zero, or (ii) a member submits a notice to redeem all or a portion of the excess activity-based capital stock. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no excess capital stock outstanding.  

The following table summarizes our regulatory capital stock by type of member (dollars in millions):  

The increase in GAAP and regulatory capital stock held at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015   was primarily due to an increase in member activity. In addition, mandatorily redeemable capital stock increased due primarily to the reclassification of captive insurance company capital stock to mandatorily redeemable capital stock in the first quarter of 2016 in response to the Finance Agency final rule affecting membership eligibility that became effective February 19, 2016.  
    
  Additional Capital from Merger 
    
  We recognized net assets acquired from the Seattle Bank by recording the par value of capital stock issued in the transaction as capital stock, with the remaining portion of net assets acquired reflected in a new capital account captioned  Additional capital from merger.  We treat this additional capital from merger as a component of total capital for regulatory capital purposes. Dividends on capital stock have been paid from this account since the merger date and we intend to pay future dividends, when and if declared, from this account until the additional capital from merger balance is depleted.

Retained Earnings 
  Our Enterprise Risk Management Policy (ERMP) includes a target level, not a required level, of retained earnings and additional capital from merger based on the amount deemed necessary to protect the redemption value of capital stock, facilitate safe and sound operations, maintain regulatory capital ratios, and support our ability to pay a relatively stable dividend. We monitor our achievement of this target and may utilize tools such as restructuring our balance sheet, generating additional income, reducing our risk exposures, increasing capital stock requirements, or reducing our dividends to enable us to return to our targeted level of retained earnings. At   September 30, 2016  , our actual retained earnings were 106 percent of target. 
  We entered into a Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement (JCE Agreement) with all of the other FHLBanks in February 2011. The JCE Agreement, as amended, is intended to enhance our capital position over time. It requires us to allocate 20 percent of our quarterly net income to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the balance of that account equals at least one percent of our average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the previous quarter. The restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our restricted retained earnings balance totaled   $200 million   and   $101 million  . One percent of our average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.5 billion. For more information on our JCE Agreement, refer to "Item 1. Business   Retained Earnings" in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  Dividends  
    
  Our Board of Directors believes any returns on capital stock above an appropriate benchmark rate that are not retained for capital growth should be returned to members that utilize our product and service offerings. Our current dividend philosophy is to pay a membership capital stock dividend similar to a benchmark rate of interest, such as average three-month LIBOR over time, and an activity-based capital stock dividend, when possible, at a level above the membership capital stock dividend. Our actual dividend is determined quarterly by our Board of Directors, based on policies, regulatory requirements, and actual performance. 
    
  The following table summarizes dividend-related information (dollars in millions):

    Amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 exclude $6 million and $15 million paid on mandatorily redeemable capital stock, which is recorded as interest expense on the Statements of Income. Amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 exclude $1 million and $2 million paid on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to our 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS 
    
  Minority and Women Inclusion 
    
  On October 27, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed amendments to its Minority and Women Inclusion regulations that, if adopted, would clarify the scope of our obligation to promote diversity and ensure inclusion. These proposed amendments update existing Finance Agency regulations aimed at promoting diversity and the inclusion and utilization of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities in all Bank business and activities, including management, employment and contracting. 

80 

     Table of Contents     

The proposed amendments would: 

require us to develop standalone diversity and inclusion strategic plans or incorporate diversity and inclusion into their existing strategic planning processes and adopt strategies for promoting diversity and ensuring inclusion; 

encourage us to expand contracting opportunities for minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities through subcontracting arrangements; 

require us to amend our policies on equal opportunity in employment and contracting by adding sexual orientation, gender identity, and status as a parent to the list of protected classifications; and 

require us to provide information in our annual reports to the Finance Agency about our efforts to advance diversity and inclusion through capital market transactions, affordable housing and community investment programs, initiatives to improve access to mortgage credit, and strategies for promoting the diversity of supervisors and managers.  
       
  Comments on the proposed amendments are due by December 27.  We are currently assessing the effect of the proposed amendments.  
    
  FHLBank Membership for Non-Federally-Insured Credit Unions 
    
  On September 28, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed amendments to regulations governing FHLBank membership that would implement statutory amendments to the FHLBank Act authorizing us to accept applications for membership from state-chartered credit unions without Federal share insurance, provided that certain prerequisites have been met. The new rule, if adopted, would generally treat these credit unions the same as other depository institutions. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by November 28, 2016.  We are currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule but do not anticipate that, if adopted, it would have a material impact.  
    
  Indemnification Payments 
    
  On September 20, 2016, the Finance Agency issued a re-proposed rule that, if adopted, would establish standards for identifying whether an indemnification payment by an FHLBank or the OF to an officer, director, employee, or other entity-affiliated party in connection with an administrative proceeding or civil action instituted by the Finance Agency is prohibited or permissible. Under the proposed rule, those payments with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action and that been initiated by the Finance Agency are only permitted if they relate to: 

premiums for professional liability insurance or fidelity bonds for directors and officers, to the extent that the insurance or fidelity bond covers expenses and restitution, but not a judgment in favor of the Finance Agency or a civil money penalty; 

expenses of defending an action, subject to an agreement to repay those expenses in certain instances; and 

amounts due under an indemnification agreement entered into on or prior to September 20, 2016. 
       
  The proposed rule also outlines the process a board of directors must undertake prior to making any permitted indemnification payment for expenses of defending an action initiated by the Finance Agency. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by December 21, 2016.  We are currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule but do not anticipate that, if adopted, it would have a material impact.

RISK MANAGEMENT 
       
  We have risk management policies, established by our Board of Directors, that monitor and control our exposure to market, liquidity, credit, operational, and strategic risk, as well as capital adequacy. Our primary objective is to manage our assets and liabilities in ways that protect the par redemption value of our capital stock from risks, including fluctuations in market interest rates and spreads. We periodically evaluate our risk management policies in order to respond to changes in our financial position and general market conditions.  
    
  Market Risk  
    
  We define market risk as the risk that Market Value of Capital Stock (MVCS) or net income will change as a result of changes in market conditions, such as interest rates, spreads, and volatilities. Interest rate risk, including mortgage prepayment risk, was our predominant type of market risk exposure during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Our general approach toward managing interest rate risk is to acquire and maintain a portfolio of assets, liabilities, and derivatives, which, taken together, limit our expected exposure to interest rate risk. Management regularly reviews our sensitivity to interest rate changes by monitoring our market risk measures in parallel and non-parallel interest rate shifts and spread and volatility movements.  
    
  Our key risk measures are MVCS Sensitivity and Projected Income Sensitivity.  
    
  MARKET VALUE OF CAPITAL STOCK SENSITIVITY 
     
  We define MVCS as an estimate of the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities (excluding mandatorily redeemable capital stock) divided by the total shares of capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) outstanding. It represents an estimation of the  liquidation value  of one share of our capital stock if all assets and liabilities were liquidated at current market prices. MVCS does not represent our long-term value, as it takes into account short-term market price fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the long-term value of the cash flows from our assets and liabilities.  
    
  The MVCS calculation uses market prices, as well as interest rates and volatilities, and assumes a run-off balance sheet. The timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are calculated by an internal model. To ensure the accuracy of the MVCS calculation, we reconcile the computed market prices of complex instruments, such as derivatives and mortgage assets, to market observed prices or dealers' quotes.  
    
  Interest rate risk stress tests of MVCS involve instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shifts in interest rates. The resulting percentage change in MVCS from the base case value is an indication of longer-term repricing risk and option risk embedded in the balance sheet. 
    
  To protect the MVCS from large interest rate swings, we manage the interest rate risk of our balance sheet by using hedging transactions, such as entering into or canceling interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and swaptions and issuing consolidated obligation bonds, including those with step-up, callable, or other structured features. 
    
  We monitor and manage to the MVCS policy limits to ensure the stability of the Bank's value. As of   September 30, 2016  , the policy limits for MVCS are 2.2 percent, 5 percent, and 12 percent declines from the base case in the up and down 50, 100, and 200 basis point parallel interest rate shift scenarios and 2.5 percent, 5.5 percent, and 13 percent declines from the base case in the up and down 50, 100, and 200 basis point non-parallel interest rate shift scenarios. Any policy limit breach requires a prompt action to address the measure outside of the policy limit and the breach must be reported to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Bank and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.  
    
  During the first quarter of 2008, due to the low interest rate environment, our Board of Directors suspended indefinitely the policy limit pertaining to the down 200 basis point parallel interest rate shift scenario. In October 2012, our Board of Directors amended the suspension by approving a rule for compliance to the down 200 basis point scenario that reinstates/suspends the associated policy limit when the 10-year swap rate increases above/drops below 2.50 percent and remains so for five consecutive days. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the 10-year swap rate was below 2.50 percent and therefore the associated policy limit was suspended.

The following tables show our base case and change from base case MVCS in dollars per share and percent change respectively, based on outstanding shares of capital stock, including shares classified as mandatorily redeemable, assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :    

The following tables show our base case and change from base case MVCS in dollars per share and percent change respectively, based on outstanding shares of capital stock, including shares classified as mandatorily redeemable, assuming instantaneous non-parallel shifts in interest rates at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :    

The change in our base case MVCS at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015   was primarily attributable to the following factors:  

Increase in retained earnings:   We recorded net income of $493 million, which included net gains on litigation settlements in the amount of $337 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This has a positive impact on our market value of equity, thereby increasing MVCS. 

Increased shares of capital stock:   Our capital stock balance increased at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015   due to capital stock issued as a result of increased member advance activity. As we issued this capital stock at par, which is below our current MVCS value, our MVCS was negatively impacted. 
       
  PROJECTED INCOME SENSITIVITY 
    
  We monitor projected 24-month income sensitivity to limit short-term earnings volatility of the Bank. The projected 24-month income sensitivity policy limit is based on forward interest rates, and business and risk management assumptions. The risk management assumptions may result in a forecast differing from business expectations. The income sensitivity policy limit specifies a floor on our projected return on capital stock for each shock scenario. Our projected return on capital stock is computed as an annualized ratio of projected net income to average projected capital stock over the projection horizon. We were in compliance with the projected 24-month income simulation policy limit at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . For more information on our Projected Income Sensitivity, refer to "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management" in our 2015 Form 10-K.

Capital Adequacy 
    
  An adequate capital position is necessary for providing safe and sound operations of the Bank. To manage our capital adequacy we maintain capital levels in accordance with Finance Agency regulations and monitor retained earnings and additional capital from merger. In addition, a capital adequacy measure from a risk management perspective is Economic Value of Capital Stock (EVCS).  
    
  RETAINED EARNINGS AND ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM MERGER TARGET LEVEL AND REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
    
  Our ERMP includes a target level of retained earnings and additional capital from merger based on the amount deemed necessary to protect the redemption value of capital stock, facilitate safe and sound operations, maintain regulatory capital ratios, and support our ability to pay a relatively stable dividend.     We are also subject to three regulatory capital requirements. For additional information on our compliance with these requirements, refer to  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources". 
    
  ECONOMIC VALUE OF CAPITAL STOCK 
    
  We define EVCS as the net present value of expected future cash flows of our assets and liabilities (excluding mandatorily redeemable capital stock), discounted at our cost of funds, and divided by the total shares of capital stock (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) outstanding. This measurement reduces the impact of day-to-day price changes that cannot be attributed to any of the standard market factors, such as movements in interest rates or volatilities. Thus, EVCS provides an estimated measure of the long-term value of one share of our capital stock.  
    
  The following table shows EVCS in dollars per share based on outstanding shares of capital stock, including shares classified as mandatorily redeemable, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  

The change in our EVCS at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015   was primarily attributable to the following factors: 

Increase in retained earnings.   We recorded net income of $493 million, which included net gains on litigation settlements in the amount of $337 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This has a positive impact on our market value of equity, thereby increasing EVCS. 

Increased shares of capital stock.    Our capital stock balance increased at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015   due to capital stock issued as a result of increased member activity. As we issued this capital stock at par, which is below our current EVCS value, our EVCS was negatively impacted. 
       
  Liquidity Risk  
    
  We define liquidity risk as the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or meet the credit needs of our members and housing associates in a timely and cost efficient manner. To manage this risk, we maintain liquidity in accordance with Finance Agency regulations. For additional information on our compliance with these requirements, refer to  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Liquidity   Liquidity Requirements".  
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  We define credit risk as the potential that our borrowers or counterparties will fail to meet their obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Our primary credit risks arise from our ongoing lending, investing, and hedging activities. Our overall objective in managing credit risk is to operate a sound credit granting process and to maintain appropriate credit administration, measurement, and monitoring practices.

     Table of Contents     

ADVANCES 
    
  We manage our credit exposure to advances through an approach that provides for an established credit limit for each borrower, ongoing reviews of each borrower's financial condition, and detailed collateral and lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers' needs for a reliable source of funding. In addition, we lend to our borrowers in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and other applicable laws. 
    
  We are required by regulation to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure our advances and other credit products. Eligible collateral includes (i) whole first mortgages on improved residential real property or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages, (ii) loans and securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof, including MBS issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae and Federal Family Education Loan Program guaranteed student loans, (iii) cash deposited with us, and (iv) other real estate-related collateral acceptable to us provided such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and we can perfect a security interest in such property. Community Financial Institutions (CFIs) may also pledge collateral consisting of secured small business, small agri-business, or small farm loans. As additional security, the FHLBank Act provides that we have a lien on each borrower's capital stock investment; however, capital stock cannot be pledged as collateral to secure credit exposures. 
    
  Borrowers may pledge collateral to us by executing a blanket lien, specifically assigning collateral, or placing physical possession of collateral with us or our custodians. We perfect our security interest in all pledged collateral by filing Uniform Commercial Code financing statements or taking possession or control of the collateral. Under the FHLBank Act, any security interest granted to us by our members, or any affiliates of our members, has priority over the claims and rights of any other party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor), unless those claims and rights would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by actual purchasers or by parties that have perfected security interests.  
    
  Under a blanket lien, we are granted a security interest in all financial assets of the borrower to fully secure the borrower's obligation. Other than securities and cash deposits, we do not initially take delivery of collateral pledged by blanket lien borrowers. In the event of deterioration in the financial condition of a blanket lien borrower, we have the ability to require delivery of pledged collateral sufficient to secure the borrower's obligation. With respect to non-blanket lien borrowers that are federally insured, we generally require collateral to be specifically assigned. With respect to non-blanket lien borrowers that are not federally insured (typically insurance companies, CDFIs, and housing associates), we generally take control of collateral through the delivery of cash, securities, or loans to us or our custodians. 
    
  Although management has policies and procedures in place to manage credit risk, we may be exposed to this risk if our outstanding advance value exceeds the liquidation value of our collateral. We mitigate this risk by applying collateral discounts or haircuts to the unpaid principal balance or market value, if available, of the collateral to determine the advance equivalent value of the collateral securing each borrower's obligation. The amount of these discounts will vary based on the type of collateral and security agreement. We determine these discounts or haircuts using data based upon historical price changes, discounted cash flow analyses, and loan level modeling. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , borrowers pledged   $328.1 billion   and   $268.8 billion   of collateral (net of applicable discounts) to support activity with us, including advances. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our advance balances were   $125.8 billion   and   $89.2 billion  . Borrowers pledge collateral in excess of their collateral requirement mainly to demonstrate available liquidity and to borrow additional amounts in the future. 
    
  Based upon our collateral and lending policies, the collateral held as security, and the repayment history on credit products, management has determined that there are no probable credit losses on our credit products as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Accordingly, we have not recorded any allowance for credit losses on our credit products. 
    
  MORTGAGE LOANS 
    
  We are exposed to credit risk through our participation in the MPF program and MPP. Mortgage loan credit risk is the risk that we will not receive timely payments of principal and interest due from mortgage borrowers because of borrower defaults. Credit risk on mortgage loans is affected by a number of factors, including loan type, borrower's credit history, and other factors such as home price fluctuations, unemployment levels, and other economic factors in the local market or nationwide.  

85 

     Table of Contents     

Through our participation in the MPF program, we invest in conventional and government-insured residential mortgage loans that are acquired through or purchased from a participating financial institution (PFI). We have offered eight MPF loan products under the MPF program: Original MPF, MPF 100, MPF 125, MPF Plus, MPF Government, MPF Government MBS, MPF Xtra, and MPF Direct. While still held in our Statements of Condition, we currently do not offer the MPF 100 or MPF Plus loan products. MPF Xtra, MPF Direct, and MPF Government MBS loans products are passed through to a third-party investor and are not maintained in our Statements of Condition. 
    
  Effective May 31, 2015, as part of the Merger, we acquired mortgage loans previously purchased by the Seattle Bank under the MPP. This program involved investment by the Seattle Bank in single-family mortgage loans that were purchased directly from MPP PFIs. Similar to the MPF program, MPP PFIs generally originated, serviced, and credit enhanced the mortgage loans sold to the Seattle Bank. In 2005, the Seattle Bank ceased entering into new MPP master commitment contracts and therefore all MPP loans acquired were originated prior to 2006. We currently do not purchase mortgage loans under this program.  
    
  The following table presents the unpaid principal balance of our MPF and MPP portfolios by product type (dollars in millions):  

We manage the credit risk on mortgage loans acquired in the MPF program and MPP by (i) using agreements to establish credit risk sharing responsibilities with our PFIs, (ii) monitoring the performance of the mortgage loan portfolio and creditworthiness of PFIs, and (iii) establishing an allowance for credit losses to reflect management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio.  
    
  Government-Insured Mortgage Loans  . For our government-insured mortgage loans, our loss protection consists of the loan guarantee, the ability of the loan servicer to repurchase any government-insured loan once it reaches 90 days delinquent, and the contractual obligation of the loan servicer to liquidate a government-insured loan in full upon sale of the REO property if not repurchased previously. Therefore, we have not recorded any allowance for credit losses on government-insured mortgage loans.  
                                                                                                                                               
  Conventional Mortgage Loans  . For our conventional mortgage loans, we have several layers of legal loss protection that are defined in agreements among us and our PFIs. For our MPF loans, these loss layers may vary depending on the MPF product alternatives selected and consist of (i) homeowner equity, (ii) primary mortgage insurance (PMI), (iii) a first loss account (FLA), and (iv) a credit enhancement obligation of the PFI. For our MPP loans, these loss layers consist of (i) homeowner equity, (ii) primary mortgage insurance (PMI), and (iii) a lender risk account (LRA). For a detailed discussion of these loss layers, refer to  Item 1. Financial Statements   Note 9   Allowance for Credit Losses.   

86 

     Table of Contents     

Allowance for Credit Losses.   We utilize an allowance for credit losses to reserve for estimated losses in our conventional MPF and MPP mortgage loan portfolios at the balance sheet date. The measurement of our MPF and MPP allowance for credit losses is determined by (i) reviewing similar conventional mortgage loans for impairment on a collective basis, (ii) reviewing conventional mortgage loans for impairment on an individual basis, and (iii) estimating additional credit losses in the conventional mortgage loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on our conventional MPF mortgage loans was $2 million and $1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The allowance for credit losses on our conventional MPP mortgage loans was less than $1 million at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
    
  A charge-off is recorded if it is estimated that the recorded investment in a loan will not be recovered. We evaluate whether to record a charge-off based upon the occurrence of a confirming event, including but not limited to, the occurrence of foreclosure or when a loan is deemed collateral-dependent. We charge-off the portion of the outstanding conventional mortgage loan balance in excess of the fair value of the underlying collateral, which is determined using property values, less selling costs and expected proceeds from PMI.  
    
  Refer to  Item 1. Financial Statements   Note 9   Allowance for Credit Losses  for additional information on our allowance for credit losses.  
    
  Non-Accrual Loans and Delinquencies  . We place a conventional mortgage loan on non-accrual status if it is determined that either the collection of interest or principal is doubtful or interest or principal is 90 days or more past due. We do not place a government-insured mortgage loan on non-accrual status due to the U.S. Government guarantee of the loan and contractual obligation of the loan servicer to repurchase the loan when certain criteria are met. Refer to  Item 1. Financial Statements   Note 9   Allowance for Credit Losses  for a summary of our non-accrual loans and mortgage loan delinquencies.  
    
  INVESTMENTS 
    
  We maintain an investment portfolio primarily to provide investment income and liquidity. Our primary credit risk on investments is the counterparties' ability to meet repayment terms. We mitigate this credit risk by purchasing investment quality securities. We define investment quality as a security with adequate financial backings so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security. We consider a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, including collateral performance, marketability, asset class or sector considerations, local and regional economic conditions, nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) credit ratings, and/or the financial health of the underlying issuer. 
    
  Finance Agency regulations limit the type of investments we may purchase. We are prohibited from investing in financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks, unless otherwise approved by the Finance Agency. Our unsecured credit exposures to U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks include the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, the counterparty may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Our unsecured credit exposures to domestic counterparties and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign commercial banks include the risk that these counterparties have extended credit to foreign counterparties. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the above regulation and did not own any financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities, other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks, and those approved by the Finance Agency.  
    
  Finance Agency regulations also include limits on the amount of unsecured credit we may extend to a counterparty or to a group of affiliated counterparties. This limit is based on a percentage of eligible regulatory capital and the counterparty's overall credit rating. Under these regulations, the level of eligible regulatory capital is determined as the lesser of our total regulatory capital or the eligible amount of regulatory capital of the counterparty. The eligible amount of regulatory capital is then multiplied by a stated percentage. The percentage that we may offer for term extensions of unsecured credit ranges from one to 15 percent based on the counterparty's credit rating. Our total overnight unsecured exposure to a counterparty may not exceed twice the regulatory limit for term exposures, or a total of two to 30 percent of the eligible amount of regulatory capital, based on the counterparty's credit rating. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the regulatory limits established for unsecured credit.

Our short-term portfolio may include, but is not limited to, interest-bearing deposits, Federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury obligations. Our long-term portfolio may include, but is not limited to, other U.S. obligations, GSE and Tennessee Valley Authority obligations, state or local housing agency obligations, taxable municipal bonds, and MBS. We face credit risk from unsecured exposures primarily within our short-term portfolio. We consider investments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, or the FDIC to be of the highest credit quality and therefore those exposures are not monitored with other unsecured investments.  
    
  We generally limit unsecured credit exposure to the following overnight investment types: 

Federal funds sold.   Unsecured loans of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Banks between financial institutions. 

Commercial paper.   Unsecured debt issued by corporations, typically for the financing of accounts receivable, inventories, and meeting short-term liabilities.  
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , our unsecured investment exposure consisted of overnight Federal funds sold. The following table presents our unsecured investment exposure by counterparty credit rating and domicile at   September 30, 2016   (excluding accrued interest receivable) (dollars in millions):

Our total investments increased at   September 30, 2016   when compared to   December 31, 2015  . The increase was due in part to the purchase of money market investments and agency MBS securities during the year. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not consider any of our investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. For more information on our evaluation of OTTI, refer to  Item 1. Financial Statements   Note 6   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment.   
    
  Mortgage-Backed Securities 
    
  We are exposed to mortgage asset credit risk through our investments in MBS. Mortgage asset credit risk is the risk that we will not receive timely payments of principal and interest due from mortgage borrowers because of borrower defaults. Credit risk on mortgage assets is affected by a number of factors, including the strength and ability to guarantee the payments from the agency that created the structure, underlying loan performance, and other economic factors in the local market or nationwide. 
    
  We limit our investments in MBS to those guaranteed by the U.S. Government, issued by a GSE, or those we determine to be investment quality at the time of purchase. We perform ongoing analysis on these investments to determine potential credit issues. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we owned   $20.8 billion   and   $18.7 billion   of MBS, of which approximately   99.9 percent   were guaranteed by the U.S. Government or issued by GSEs and   0.1 percent   were private-label MBS during both periods.  
    
  Our private-label MBS are variable rate securities backed by prime loans that were securitized prior to 2004. We record these investments as HTM. The following table summarizes characteristics of our private-label MBS (dollars in millions):

  DERIVATIVES 
    
  We execute most of our derivative transactions with large banks and major broker-dealers. Over-the-counter derivative transactions may be either executed directly with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent), with a Derivative Clearing Organization (cleared derivatives).  
    
  We are subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative agreements. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures and collateral requirements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. We manage credit risk through credit analyses, collateral requirements, and adherence to the requirements set forth in our policies and Finance Agency regulations.  

90 

     Table of Contents     

Uncleared Derivatives  . Due to risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative agreements, we generally require collateral on uncleared derivative agreements. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty. A counterparty generally must deliver collateral to us if the total market value of our exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, we do not anticipate any credit losses on our uncleared derivative agreements. 
    
  Cleared Derivatives  . For cleared derivatives, the Clearinghouse is our counterparty. We are subject to risk of nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that we post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes us to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. However, the use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral is posted daily, through a clearing agent, for changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives. We do not anticipate any credit losses on our cleared derivatives. 
    
  The contractual or notional amount of derivatives reflects our involvement in the various classes of financial instruments. Our maximum credit risk is the estimated cost of replacing derivatives if there is a default, minus the value of any related collateral, including initial and variation margin. In determining maximum credit risk, we consider accrued interest receivables and payables as well as our ability to net settle positive and negative positions with the same counterparty and/or clearing agent when netting requirements are met.

Operational Risk 
    
  We define operational risk as the risk of loss or harm from inadequate or failed processes, people, and/or systems, including those emanating from external sources. Operational risk is inherent in all of our business activities and processes. Management has established policies and procedures to reduce the likelihood of operational risk and designed our annual risk assessment process to provide ongoing identification, measurement, and monitoring of operational risk. Due to the manual nature of many of our processes, our operational risk exposure is elevated. To mitigate this risk, we continue to focus on process and control improvements, system upgrades, and assessments of staffing adequacy. During the first nine months of 2016, we have added staff to lead and support critical business functions, designed a new control structure surrounding spreadsheets and other applications used in the financial reporting and close process, and implemented enhancements to access controls over key IT applications. 
    
  Strategic Risk 
    
  We define strategic risk as the risk of an adverse impact on our mission, financial condition, or current and future profitability resulting from external factors that may occur in both the short- and long-term. Strategic risk includes political, reputation, regulatory, and/or environmental factors, many of which are beyond our control. From time to time, proposals are made, or legislative and regulatory changes are considered, which could affect our cost of doing business or other aspects of our business. We mitigate strategic risk through strategic business planning and monitoring of our external environment. For additional information on some of the more important risks we face, refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our 2015 Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  See  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Risk Management   Market Risk  and the sections referenced therein for quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
    
  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and chief executive officer (CEO), and chief financial officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
    
  Management, with the participation of our President and CEO, and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, and management's previous identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2015, our President and CEO, and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  As previously disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K, management identified three material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The three weaknesses previously identified were: 
    
           1. 
    We did not maintain effective control over multiple changes within our business environment during 2015, including certain implications of the Merger, based on the criteria established in the COSO framework. COSO Principle 9 states that an organization should identify and assess changes that could significantly impact the system of internal controls. As these significant changes occur, the scope and nature of the organization s leadership, priorities, business model, and business processes and activities need to adapt and evolve because a control infrastructure effective in one set of conditions might not be effective when those conditions change significantly. Our internal control infrastructure failed to effectively adapt to and evolve around multiple business environment changes that occurred during 2015. 
       
           2. 
    We did not maintain effective controls over spreadsheets used in our financial close and reporting process. Specifically, we identified multiple issues with the design and operating effectiveness of controls over key spreadsheets used in our financial close and reporting process. 
       
           3. 
    We did not consistently conform to existing internal control procedures established to ensure appropriate logical access to the Bank s information technology systems. Specifically, the manual processes used to remove unnecessary employee and contractor access and execute the required management testing of the removal process were not performed timely as designed as a result of multiple changes within our business environment, including the Merger.   
          
  Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    
    
  Management is committed to improving our overall system of internal control over financial reporting and is taking steps to fully remediate the identified material weaknesses. The following briefly describes certain remediation actions we have taken or plan to take to address these material weaknesses:  
           1. 
    Management has made changes to the governance of our internal control infrastructure and processes that are expected to facilitate timely, recurring evaluations of internal controls over financial reporting for known and/or expected changes in our business environment during each calendar year. This process included a complete review and assessment of our system of internal control over financial reporting conducted by an independent third party working closely with Bank staff. As a result of this assessment, certain internal controls over financial reporting were enhanced and put in place. These controls are currently being tested by internal audit. The Bank also added staff to lead and support this business function. 
     
   94 

     Table of Contents     

2. 
    Management has designed a new control structure surrounding spreadsheets and other applications used in the financial reporting and close process as part of a comprehensive project to address the related material weakness, which is in the process of implementation. Once completed, this project is expected to increase the number and effectiveness of controls surrounding spreadsheets utilized in the financial reporting process. Longer term, management intends to reduce the number of financial reporting spreadsheets through automation. As of September 30, 2016, the new control structure has been implemented for the most significant spreadsheets. These controls are currently being tested by internal audit. 
       
           3. 
    Management has designed and implemented enhancements to access controls over key IT applications used in the financial reporting and close process. This included strengthening existing controls, adding additional controls, and adding staff to the information technology department to support the effective execution of these controls. These controls are currently being tested by internal audit. 
     Management believes that the measures described above should strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot provide assurance, however, that these steps will remediate such weaknesses or the timing of when such steps will be completed, nor can we be certain of whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions. The material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the applicable remedial actions and associated internal controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, management continued to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses and other control deficiencies identified at December 31, 2015. Other than these remediation steps, which included certain changes in controls as outlined above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting at September 30, 2016.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
       
  As a result of the Merger, we are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings initiated by the Seattle Bank against various entities relating to its purchases and subsequent impairments of certain private-label MBS, as described below. Although the Seattle Bank sold all private-label MBS during the first quarter of 2015, we continue to be involved in these proceedings. The private-label MBS litigation is described in  Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings  in our 2015 Form 10-K and below. After consultation with legal counsel, other than the private-label MBS litigation, we do not believe any legal proceedings to which we are a party could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Private-Label MBS Litigation 
    
  As the Seattle Bank previously reported, in December of 2009, it filed 11 complaints in the Superior Court of Washington for King County relating to private-label MBS that it purchased from various dealers and financial institutions in an aggregate original principal amount of approximately $4 billion. The Seattle Bank's complaints under Washington State law requested rescission of its purchases of the securities and repurchases of the securities by the defendants for the original purchase prices plus eight percent per annum (plus related costs), minus distributions on the securities received by the Seattle Bank. The Seattle Bank asserted that the defendants made untrue statements and omitted important information in connection with their sales of the securities to the Seattle Bank. 
    
  In October 2010, each defendant group filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings against it. The issues raised by those motions were fully briefed and were the subject of oral arguments that occurred in March and April 2011. In a series of decisions handed down in June, July, and August 2011, the judge handling the pre-trial motions ruled in favor of the Seattle Bank on all issues, except that the judge granted the defendants' motions to dismiss certain of the Seattle Bank's allegations of misrepresentation as to owner occupancy of properties securing loans in the securitized loan pools. In addition, the judge granted motions to dismiss a group of related entities as defendants in one of the 11 cases for lack of personal jurisdiction. The resolution of the pre-trial motions allowed the cases to proceed to the discovery phase, which is complete. In a series of rulings in November 2015, the judge denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment on common issues and granted Seattle Bank's motion to strike the seller defendants' due diligence defenses. With a few exceptions, the judge has also denied, in whole or in part, each defendant's individual motion or motions for summary judgment. The judge granted partial summary judgment to three defendants on a total of five certificates.  
    
  Of the 11 cases initially filed, eight have been settled, two remain active, and one has been appealed. The aggregate consideration paid for the private-label MBS that continue to be actively litigated or are currently on appeal is $1.0 billion. The first trial against one of the remaining defendant groups is scheduled for early 2017.   
    
  Litigation Settlement Gains 
    
  Litigation settlement gains are considered realized and recorded when we receive cash or assets that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash or claims to cash. In addition, litigation settlement gains are considered realizable and recorded when we enter into a signed agreement that is not subject to appeal, where the counterparty has the ability to pay, and the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated. Prior to being realized or realizable, we consider potential litigation settlement gains to be gain contingencies, and therefore they are not recorded in the Statements of Income. 
  We record legal expenses related to litigation settlements as incurred in other expenses in the Statements of Income with the exception of certain legal expenses related to litigation settlement awards that are contingent based fees for the attorneys representing the Bank. We incur and recognize these contingent based legal fees only when litigation settlement awards are realized, at which time these fees are netted against the gains recognized on the litigation settlement.  
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we did not settle any private-label MBS claims. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we settled multiple private-label MBS claims and recognized $337 million in net gains on litigation settlements. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized $12 million in net gains on litigation settlements. We continue to pursue litigation with the other defendants.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
    
  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) serves as the independent registered public accounting firm for our Bank.  Rule 201(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (the Loan Rule) prohibits an accounting firm, such as PwC, from having certain financial relationships with its audit clients and affiliated entities. Specifically, the Loan Rule provides, in relevant part, that an accounting firm generally would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a  record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client s equity securities.    
  PwC has advised our Bank as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 that it has a borrowing relationship with a Bank member (referred below as the  lender ) who owns more than 10 percent of the Bank s capital stock, which under the Loan Rule, would call into question PwC s independence with respect to the Bank. We are providing this disclosure to explain the facts and circumstances, as well as PwC s and the Audit Committee s conclusions, concerning PwC s objectivity and impartiality with respect to the audit of our Bank.   
  PwC advised our Audit Committee that it believes that, in light of the facts of this borrowing relationship, its ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment on all matters encompassed within PwC s audit engagement have not been impaired and that a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same conclusion. PwC has advised the Audit Committee that this conclusion is based in part on the following considerations: 
             
    the borrowings are in good standing and the lender does not have the right to take action against PwC, as borrower, in connection with the financings; 

the debt balances outstanding are immaterial to PwC and to the lender; 

PwC has borrowing relationships with a diverse group of lenders, therefore PwC is not dependent on any single lender or group of lenders; and  

the PwC audit engagement team has no involvement in PwC s treasury function and PwC s treasury function has no oversight or ability to influence the PwC audit engagement team. 

97 

     Table of Contents     

Additionally, our Audit Committee assessed PwC s ability to perform an objective and impartial audit, and continue to conclude that PwC has maintained objectivity and impartiality in connection with its audit of our financial statements. The conclusion is based on the unique nature and status of our Bank, and due to our ownership structure and limited voting rights of our members. In addition to the above listed considerations, the Audit Committee considered the following: 

the lender is subject to the same terms and conditions for conducting business with the Bank as any other member. 
       
  Based on the Audit Committee s evaluation, the Audit Committee has concluded that PwC s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within PwC s audit engagement has not been impaired.

Each of the MPF Banks and the MPF Provider shall hereinafter be referred to as a    Party    and collectively the    Parties   . 
    
  RECITALS 
    
  WHEREAS, the MPF Program is a program under which MPF Banks purchase residential mortgage loans originated pursuant to the requirements of the Guides from PFIs; 
    
  WHEREAS, each MPF Bank has entered into a separate Services Agreement, with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, in its capacity as the MPF Provider; 
    
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks entered among themselves and with the MPF Provider into a Liquidity Option and Master Participation Agreement; 
    
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks also entered among themselves and with the MPF Provider into Servicing Transfer Agreements; 
    
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks desire to continue their participation in the MPF Program and to consolidate the MPF Agreements into this Agreement, to amend the provisions of the MPF Agreements in part and to transfer certain provisions of the MPF Agreements relating to operating and support procedures to the FHLB Guide, with the intention that this Agreement and the FHLB Guide supersede the MPF Agreements; and 
    
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks intend that each Federal Home Loan Bank that desires to participate in the MPF Program become a Party to this Agreement. 
    
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual promises and agreements herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as follows: 
    
  ARTICLE I. DEFINITIONS 
    
  Section 1.1.   Certain Definitions  . 
    
  All capitalized terms used in this Agreement, which includes the recitals, shall have the meanings set forth in the Glossary of the FHLB Guide or in the Guides or as defined in this Agreement. In case of any conflict as to the meaning of a capitalized term, the definition in the Glossary of the FHLB Guide shall control. 

ARTICLE II. FHLB PARTICIPATION IN THE MPF PROGRAM 
    
  Section 2.1.   Participation in the MPF Program  . 
    
  Each Federal Home Loan Bank that executes this Agreement hereby agrees to participate in the MPF Program as an MPF Bank and to offer, at its election, Program Loan products to its PFIs under the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the FHLB Guide. 
    
  Section 2.2.   Applicability of Agreement  . 
    
  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this Agreement and the FHLB Guide shall apply to all prior, existing and future Program Loans, Master Commitments, Delivery Commitments, participation rights and obligations and any Servicing transfer rights and obligations unless specified otherwise. 
    
  Section 2.3.   FHLB Guide  . 
    
  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the terms of the FHLB Guide, as amended, restated, replaced or otherwise modified from time to time as specified in the FHLB Guide, are incorporated herein by reference and are made an integral part of this Agreement. 
    
  (a)  Amendments or Supplements  . The FHLB Guide may be amended or supplemented from time to time as follows: 
    
  (1)   Non-Substantive Revisions  . Prior to issuing any non-Substantive Revisions to the FHLB Guide, the MPF Provider will consult with the Active MPF Banks after distributing a draft of the proposed non-Substantive Revisions to the Active MPF Banks for review. The MPF Provider will use commercially reasonable best efforts to balance differences of opinions among the Active MPF Banks, taking into account the direction or purpose of the overall MPF Program as established by the MPF Governance Committee, and abide by any additional obligation of the MPF Provider in determining whether and how to incorporate or address any comments from the Active MPF Banks concerning any non-Substantive Revisions. Upon receipt of any draft non- Substantive Revisions to the FHLB Guide, the Active MPF Bank must respond within fifteen Business Days unless a longer time for review and approval is allowed in the transmittal of the draft revisions, or otherwise approved by the MPF Provider in writing; provided, however, that non-Substantive Revisions which must be made to the FHLB Guide to comply with FHFA rules or regulations, third-party investors requirements, Applicable Law, or external matters beyond the control of the MPF Provider, may have a shorter review period, if needed to achieve compliance, but not less than two (2) Business Days (and, for the avoidance of doubt the MPF Provider shall be permitted to make any such revision notwithstanding whether the consent of the Active MPF Banks is obtained). An Active MPF Bank s review of draft FHLB Guide non- Substantive Revisions and opportunity to comment will be considered completed if there is no response from the Active MPF Bank within the time period specified herein, in the transmittal or otherwise specified in writing by the MPF Provider. The MPF Provider may elect to publish the non-Substantive Revisions without additional review by the Active MPF Banks or, if the MPF Provider deems it appropriate, to provide the MPF Banks an additional review period. Any comments sent by any MPF Bank after publication of any revisions to the FHLB Guide will be logged in by the MPF Provider and considered for inclusion when future revisions are made to the FHLB Guide. If an Active MPF Bank determines the proposed revision should be classified as a Substantive Revision, that Active MPF Bank must object to the non-Substantive Revision classification within two (2) Business Days from  

receipt of the proposed revision. The MPF Provider shall then (i) request the Active MPF Banks to review the proposed revision as a Substantive Revision pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(2) or (ii) refer the proposed revision to the MPF Governance Committee for further action. If the MPF Provider elects a Substantive Revision review, two (2) Business Days will be deducted from the review time provided in Section 2.3(a)(2). 
    
  (2)   Substantive Revisions  . Except for FHLB Guide revisions subject to Section 2.3(a)(3), Substantive Revisions may be made only with the approval of a super majority of the Active MPF Banks, which is defined as 66% of the Active MPF Banks (rounded up to the nearest whole number), (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) after distributing a draft of the proposed Substantive Revisions to the Active MPF Banks for review. Upon receipt of any draft Substantive Revisions to the FHLB Guide, each Active MPF Bank must respond within ten (10) Business Days unless a longer time for review and approval is allowed in the transmittal of the draft Substantive Revisions or otherwise approved by the MPF Provider in writing. The MPF Provider shall be permitted to make any changes which must be made to the FHLB Guide to comply with FHFA rules or regulations, third-party investors requirements, Applicable Law, or external matters beyond the control of the MPF Provider without the majority approval of the Active MPF Banks; however, the MPF Provider shall circulate such revisions to the Active MPF Banks for review as provided for non-Substantive Revisions. No response or no substantive objection by an Active MPF Bank to a proposed Substantive Revision within the timeframe specified shall be considered an approval by such Active MPF Bank of the proposed Substantive Revision. In the event that circulation of additional draft Substantive Revisions are necessary, each Active MPF Bank shall respond within five (5) Business Days unless a longer time for review and approval is allowed in the transmittal of the draft Substantive Revisions or otherwise approved by the MPF Provider in writing. For the avoidance of doubt, any proposed revision to an Appendix to the FHLB Guide, including without limitation, to any forms or the Supplemental Information, shall be deemed a non-Substantive Revision. 
    
  (3)   Revisions to MPF Membership Fee and Transaction Services Fee  . Any FHLB Guide revisions related to the MPF Membership Fee or the Transaction Services Fee specified in ARTICLE IX will be decided by the MPF Governance Committee. 
    
  (b)  Applicability of Amendments and Supplements  . Unless otherwise specified, all amendments and supplements to the FHLB Guide shall apply to all existing Program Loans, Participation Interests, Master Commitments and Delivery Commitments.

The Parties agree that quality control reviews for Program Loans shall be in accordance with the FHLB Guide. 
    
  Section 3.7.   Financial Reporting and Controls  .

The MPF Service Center operations shall be as described in the FHLB Guide. 
    
  Section 3.9.   Services of the Custodian  . 
    
  The MPF Provider shall act as the custodian for the MPF Bank with respect to all Program Loans funded or purchased by the MPF Bank pursuant to the MPF Program.

Consistent with applicable law and regulation and as provided in the FHLB Guide, each MPF Bank shall promptly provide notice to the MPF Provider of any material adverse change in the financial condition of any such MPF Bank s PFIs of which it becomes aware and that such MPF Bank reasonably believes could result in the PFI s breach of the PFI Agreement.

  (1)  Under the Pricing Process, each MPF Bank shall be responsible for, and the following shall be deemed to be in the control of each MPF Bank:

  (a)   Election of Alternative Pricing by MPF Bank  . Each MPF Bank may elect to create MPF Bank Base Price Schedules in accordance with the applicable provisions in the FHLB Guide. An MPF Bank shall indicate its election to create MPF Bank Base  Price Schedules by executing the election form specified in the FHLB Guide (and delivering such form to the MPF Provider) and upon such election such MPF Bank agrees to be subject to the alternative pricing provisions specified in the FHLB Guide and such MPF Bank commits to utilizing its MPF Bank Base Price Schedules on a daily basis and as a regular course of business except for emergencies or as otherwise agreed to by the MPF Provider and such MPF Bank.

    third from the Credit Enhancement obligation of the applicable PFI, if any;

For avoidance of any doubt, written notice of termination shall only terminate this Agreement as between the MPF Bank providing such notice and all other existing Parties to this Agreement, and the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect among all such other existing Parties. If the MPF Provider provides written notice of termination to an MPF Bank, the written notice of termination shall only terminate this Agreement as between such MPF Bank and all other existing Parties to this Agreement, and the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect among all such other existing Parties.

  (b)  Remedies for the MPF Provider s Default     . Without limiting the effect of Section 12.2, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default caused by the MPF Provider, each MPF Bank shall have the right, subject to the requirements of Section 13.1(b), to terminate this Agreement with respect to such MPF Bank. Until the MPF Provider s obligations to provide the Services terminates as provided in Section 13.1(b), such MPF Bank shall continue to pay the Transaction Services Fee for the Services after a termination in accordance with the provisions of the FHLB Guide at the time of such termination. Further, the MPF Provider shall pay to such MPF Bank an amount equal to the MPF Bank s actual and direct damages arising from the Event of Default, but the MPF Provider shall have no responsibility for any consequential or punitive damages.

  (d)  Without limiting the rights of the MPF Provider and any other MPF Bank under this Agreement and the FHLB Guide, the MPF Provider shall not have an interest in any (i) other property taken as security for any other credit, loan or financial accommodation made or furnished to any PFI by any MPF Bank in which the Participant has no participation interest; (ii) property now or hereafter in the MPF Bank s possession or under the MPF Bank s control other than by reason of any PFI Agreement; or (iii) deposits or other indebtedness which may be or might become security for performance or payment of any obligations and liabilities of any PFI under the PFI Agreement by reason of the general description contained in any instrument other than the PFI Agreement held by such MPF Bank or by reason of any right of setoff, counterclaim, banker s lien or otherwise.

  Section 14.7.   Severability of Provisions  . 
  Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

  The Parties hereto recognize and agree that it may be impossible to measure in money the damages which will accrue to any Party hereto or its successors or assigns by reason of a failure to perform any of the obligations arising under this Agreement. Therefore, if a Party or its successors or assigns shall institute any action or proceeding to enforce any provision hereof, any Party against whom such action or proceeding is brought hereby agrees that specific performance may be sought and obtained for any breach of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving actual damages. 
    
  Section 14.12.   Mediation of Disputes; Jurisdiction and Venue  . 
    
  (a)  No  Party  shall  institute  a  proceeding  before  any  tribunal  to  resolve  any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or 
  invalidity thereof (a    Dispute   ), before such Party has sought to resolve the dispute through mediation. If the applicable Parties do not promptly agree on a mediator, any such Party may request the Director of the FHFA to appoint a mediator. All mediation proceedings under this Agreement shall be held in Washington, D.C. or such other location as the applicable Parties may agree upon. If the mediator is unable to facilitate a settlement of the Dispute within a reasonable time, as determined by the mediator, the mediator shall issue a written statement to the applicable Parties to that effect and the complaining Party may then pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity. The fees and expenses of the mediator shall be paid by the Party initiating mediation, unless the applicable Parties agree otherwise, but the paying Party shall  

be entitled to a judgment for reimbursement of such fees and expenses if it prevails against any other Party on all material issues in a judicial proceeding. 
    
  (b)  Each Party consents to the exercise of jurisdiction over its person and its property by any court of competent jurisdiction situated in the City of Chicago, State of Illinois (whether it be a court of the State of Illinois or a court of the United States of America situated in Illinois) for the enforcement of this Agreement or in any other controversy, dispute or question arising hereunder, and such Party waives any and all personal or other rights to object to such jurisdiction for such purposes. Each Party, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives any objection which it may have to the laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding in any such court; provided, that the provisions of this paragraph shall not be deemed to preclude any other appropriate forum. If such litigation is commenced at any time, the applicable Parties agree that service of process may be made, and personal jurisdiction over the other Party obtained, by service of a copy of the summons, complaint and other pleadings required to commence such litigation by United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed to such Party at its address for notices as provided in this Agreement. The applicable Parties waive all claims of lack of effectiveness or error by reason of any such service. 
    
  Section 14.13.   No Joint and Several Liability; Necessary Parties  . 
    
  No Party to this Agreement shall be jointly and severally liable for any breach of any other Party under this Agreement. No Party to this Agreement shall be deemed a necessary party to any proceeding or litigation simply by reason of being a Party of this Agreement. The Parties agree that in the event of any dispute or disagreement among Parties relating to this Agreement that require any type of proceeding or litigation to resolve the dispute or disagreement, only the Parties among whom such dispute has arisen shall be made a party to any proceeding or litigation. 
    
  Section 14.14.   Amendment and Restatement 
    
  This Agreement amends, restates, replaces and supersedes in their entirety the MPF Agreements. Each Party to this Agreement (a) agrees that all references to the MPF Agreements that are included in any other agreement or other document executed or delivered by any Party in connection with the MPF Program shall be deemed to be references to this Agreement, as amended from time to time, and (b) hereby amends all such MPF Agreements and other documents to the extent necessary or appropriate to reflect such changed references. 
    
  Section 14.15.   Equal Treatment of MPF Banks  . 
  The MPF Program is a cooperative program among the MPF Banks and the MPF Provider. Consequently, the MPF Provider and each MPF Bank agree that any amendment or modification to this Agreement offered by or to any Active MPF Bank shall be promptly offered to all other Active MPF Banks.
