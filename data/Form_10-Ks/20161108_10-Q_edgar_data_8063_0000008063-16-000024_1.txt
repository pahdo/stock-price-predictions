  1) Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. 
  All share quantities and per share data reported have been restated to reflect the impact of the    three-for-twenty   Class B stock distribution to shareholders of record on   October 11, 2016  .   
  Operating Results 
  The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Operating results for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. 
  For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in Astronics Corporation s 2015 annual report on Form 10-K.

5) Goodwill 
  The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine months ended October 1, 2016  : 

6) Long-term Debt and Notes Payable 
  The Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement as amended are jointly and severally guaranteed by each domestic subsidiary of the Company other than a non-material subsidiary. The obligations are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Company s and the guarantors  assets. 
  The Company's Credit Agreement consists of a   $350 million   revolving credit line with the option to increase the line by up to   $150 million  . On January 13, 2016, the Company amended the Agreement to add a new lender and extend the maturity date of the credit facility from September 26, 2019 to   January 13, 2021  . At   October 1, 2016   there was   $151.0 million   outstanding on the revolving credit facility and there remains   $197.9 million   available, net of outstanding letters of credit. The credit facility allocates up to   $20 million   of the   $350 million   revolving credit line for the issuance of letters of credit, including certain existing letters of credit. At   October 1, 2016  , outstanding letters of credit totaled   $1.1 million  . 
  The maximum permitted leverage ratio of funded debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Agreement) is   3.5   to 1, increasing to   4.0   to 1 for up to   two   fiscal quarters following the closing of an acquisition permitted under the Agreement. The Company will pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of the facility at a rate equal to one-, three- or six-month LIBOR plus between   137.5   basis points and   225   basis points based upon the Company s leverage ratio. The Company will also pay a commitment fee to the lenders in an amount equal to between   17.5   basis points and   35   basis points on the undrawn portion of the credit facility, based upon the Company s leverage ratio. The Company must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to interest expense) of   3.0   to 1 for the term of the Agreement. The Company s interest coverage ratio was   29.9   to 1 at   October 1, 2016  . The Company s leverage ratio was   1.52   to 1 at   October 1, 2016  . 
  In the event of voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of the Company or any subsidiary, all unpaid principal and other amounts owing under the Agreement automatically become due and payable. Other events of default, such as failure to make payments as they become due and breach of financial and other covenants, change of control, judgments over a certain amount, and cross default under other agreements give the Agent the option to declare all such amounts immediately due and payable.

8) Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rates were approximately   29.3%   and   33.0%   for the   nine   months ended and   26.5%   and   31.2%   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively. The tax rates in 2016 were favorably impacted by the inclusion of the federal research and development tax credit due to its permanent reinstatement in the fourth quarter of 2015.

9) Shareholders  Equity 
  The changes in shareholders  equity for the   nine months ended October 1, 2016   are summarized as follows as adjusted to reflect the impact of the   three-for-twenty   distribution of Class B Stock as discussed in Note 10: 

On February 24, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $50 million   of common stock (the  Buyback Program ). The Buyback Program allows the Company to purchase shares of its common stock in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Buyback Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Under this program the Company has repurchased approximately   517,000   shares for   $17.5 million  .

10) Earnings Per Share 
  Basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding are as follows: 

The above information has been adjusted to reflect the impact of the    three-for-twenty   Class B stock distribution to shareholders of record on   October 11, 2016  .   
  Stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the underlying common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they are out-of-the-money and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The number of common shares covered by out-of-the-money stock options at   October 1, 2016   was approximately   41,000   shares. 
   
  11) Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and Other Comprehensive Loss

12) Supplemental Retirement Plan and Related Post Retirement Benefits 
  The Company has   two   non-qualified supplemental retirement defined benefit plans ( SERP  and  SERP II ) for certain executive officers. The following table sets forth information regarding the net periodic pension cost for the plans. 

Participants in the SERP are entitled to paid medical, dental and long-term care insurance benefits upon retirement under the plan. The following table sets forth information regarding the net periodic cost recognized for those benefits: 

13) Sales to Major Customers 
  The Company has a significant concentration of business with   two   major customers, each in excess of 10% of consolidated sales. The loss of either of these customers would significantly, negatively impact our sales and earnings. 
  Sales to these   two   customers represented   21%   and   15%   of consolidated sales for the   nine   months ended and   21%   and   15%   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  . Sales to these customers were in the Aerospace segment. Accounts receivable from these customers at   October 1, 2016   was approximately   $35.9 million  . Sales to these   two   customers represented   21%   and   13%   of consolidated sales for the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015   and   19%   and   12%   for the three months ended   October 3, 2015  . 
   
  14) Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, we do not expect these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any legal matter or should several legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, then the financial results of that particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 
    
  On December 29, 2010, Lufthansa Technik AG ( Lufthansa ) filed a Statement of Claim in the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany. Lufthansa s claim asserts that our subsidiary, AES sold, marketed and brought into use in Germany a power supply system which infringes upon a German patent held by Lufthansa. The relief sought by Lufthansa includes requiring AES to stop selling and marketing the allegedly infringing power supply system, a recall of allegedly infringing products sold to commercial customers since November 26, 2003 and compensation for damages. The claim does not specify an estimate of damages and a damages claim will be made by Lufthansa only if it receives a favorable ruling on the determination of infringement. The value of the dispute has been set by the Court to be    2 million  . This is an estimate of the commercial value of the matter. 
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

On February 6, 2015, the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany rendered its decision that the patent was infringed. The judgment does not require AES to recall products which are already installed in aircraft or have been sold to other end users.  On July 15, 2015, Lufthansa advised AES of their intention to enforce the accounting provisions of the decision, which required AES to provide certain financial information regarding sales of the infringing product to enable Lufthansa to make an estimate of requested damages. Additionally, if Lufthansa provides the required bank guarantee specified in the decision, the Company may be required to offer a recall of products which are in the distribution channels in Germany. No such bank guarantee has been issued to date.  
    
  The Company appealed and believes it has valid defenses to refute the decision. The appeal was heard on October 12, 2016 at the Higher Regional Court of Karlsruhe. Should that ruling be unfavorable, the Company may choose to appeal to the Federal Supreme Court. The enforcement of the accounting provision of the decision, as discussed above, has no impact on the appeals process. As a result, we do not currently have sufficient information to provide an estimate of AES s potential exposure related to this matter. As loss exposure is neither probable nor estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of   October 1, 2016  .  The Court is scheduled to issue its decision on November 9, 2016. 
    
  On November 26, 2014, Lufthansa filed a complaint in the United States District for the Western District of Washington.  Lufthansa s complaint in this action alleges that AES manufactures, uses, sells and offers for sale a power supply system which infringes upon a U.S. patent held by Lufthansa. The patent at issue in the U.S. action is based on technology similar to that involved in the German action. On April 25, 2016, the Court issued its ruling on claim construction, holding that the sole independent claim in the patent is indefinite, rendering all claims in the patent indefinite. Based on this ruling, AES filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the Court s ruling that the patent is indefinite renders the patent invalid and unenforceable.  On July 20, 2016 the U.S. District Court granted the motion for summary judgment and issued an order dismissing all claims against AES with prejudice.  Lufthansa has filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The Company believes that it has valid defenses to Lufthansa s claims and will vigorously contest the appeal.  As loss exposure is neither probable nor estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of   October 1, 2016  .

15) Segment Information 
  Below are the sales and operating profit by segment for the three and   nine months ended October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   and a reconciliation of segment operating profit to income before income taxes. Operating profit is net sales less cost of products sold and other operating expenses excluding interest and corporate expenses. Cost of products sold and other operating expenses are directly identifiable to the respective segment. 

Total Assets:    

16) Fair Value 
    
  A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Fair value is based upon an exit price model. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and involves consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability. 
  The Company follows a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows: 
  Level 1   inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  

Level 2   inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
  Level 3   inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. 
  On a Recurring Basis: 
  A financial asset or liability s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The financial liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis consisted of contingent consideration related to certain prior acquisitions, valued at   zero   at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , determined using Level 3 inputs. 
    
  On a Non-recurring Basis: 
  The Company estimates the fair value of reporting units, utilizing unobservable Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs require significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices or observable inputs for assets of a similar nature. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of reporting units utilizing unobservable inputs. The fair value measurement of the reporting unit under the step-one and step-two analysis of the quantitative goodwill impairment test are classified as Level 3 inputs. 
  Intangible assets that are amortized are evaluated for recoverability whenever adverse effects or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability test consists of comparing the undiscounted projected cash flows with the carrying amount. Should the carrying amount exceed undiscounted projected cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount exceeds fair value. For the Company s indefinite-lived intangible asset, the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value, determined using the relief from royalty method, with its carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value. 
  Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and notes payable approximate fair value. The carrying value of the Company s variable rate long-term debt instruments also approximates fair value due to the variable rate feature of these instruments. As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company concluded that no indicators of impairment relating to intangible assets or goodwill existed and an interim test was not performed.

17) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ) which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions.  The guidance makes several modifications to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. In addition, ASU 2016-09 clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing how the adoption of this standard will impact the financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ) which requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The standard also requires additional disclosures by lessees and contains targeted changes to accounting by lessors. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be adopted at the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently assessing the impact on the financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-9,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . This new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, pursuant to the issuance of ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date   issued in August 2015. The comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used.

    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

(The following should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  .) 
   
  OVERVIEW 
  Astronics Corporation ( Astronics  or the  Company ) is a leading supplier of products to the global aerospace, defense, electronics and semiconductor industries. Our products and services include advanced, high-performance electrical power generation, distribution and motion systems, lighting   safety systems, avionics products, aircraft structures, systems certification and automated test systems. 
  Our Aerospace segment designs and manufactures products for the global aerospace industry. Product lines include lighting   safety systems, electrical power generation, distribution and motion systems, aircraft structures, avionics products, systems certification and other products. Our Aerospace customers are the airframe manufacturers ("OEM") that build aircraft for the commercial, military and general aviation markets, suppliers to those OEM s, aircraft operators such as airlines and branches of the U.S. Department of Defense as well as the Federal Aviation Administration and airport operators. Our Test Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures and maintains automated test systems that support the semiconductor, aerospace, communications and weapons test systems as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and military applications. In the Test Systems segment, Astronics  products are sold to a global customer base including OEM's and prime government contractors for both electronics and military products. 
  Our strategy is to increase our value by developing technologies and capabilities either internally or through acquisition, and using those capabilities to provide innovative solutions to the aerospace and defense, semiconductor and other markets where our technology can be beneficial. 
  Important factors affecting our growth and profitability are the rate at which new aircraft are produced, government funding of military programs, our ability to have our products designed into new aircraft and the rates at which aircraft owners, including commercial airlines, refurbish or install upgrades to their aircraft. New aircraft build rates and aircraft owners spending on upgrades and refurbishments is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the global economy. Once designed into a new aircraft, the spare parts business is frequently retained by the Company. Future growth and profitability of the Test Systems business is dependent on developing and procuring new and follow-on business in commercial electronics and semiconductor markets as well as with the military. The nature of our Test Systems business is such that it pursues large multi-year projects. There can be significant periods of time between orders in this business which may result in large fluctuations of sales and profit levels and backlog from period to period. 
   
  ACQUISITIONS 
  On January 14, 2015, the Company purchased 100% of the equity of Armstrong Aerospace, Inc. ( Armstrong ) for $52.6 million in cash. Specializing in connectivity, in-flight entertainment, and electrical power systems, Armstrong is a leading provider of engineering design and certification solutions for commercial aircraft, and is located in Itasca, Illinois. Armstrong is included in our Aerospace segment.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUTLOOK    

A discussion by segment can be found at  Segment Results of Operations and Outlook  in this MD A. 
  CONSOLIDATED   THIRD   QUARTER RESULTS 
  Consolidated sales were down $45.0 million from the same period last year.  Aerospace segment sales of $125.2 million were down $13.5 million and Test Systems segment sales of $29.9 million were down $31.5 million.   
  Consolidated cost of products sold in the third quarter decreased $24.3 million to $116.4 million from $140.7 million for the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales volume. Engineering and development ( E D ) costs were $22.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, down slightly from $22.5 million of E D costs in last year s third quarter. As a percent of sales, E D was 14.3% and 11.3% in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses decreased $1.2 million compared with the 2015 third quarter, due primarily to lower commissions on lower sales volumes in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 2015.   
  The effective tax rate for the third quarter was   26.5%  , compared with   31.2%   in the third quarter of 2015. The tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was favorably impacted by the permanent reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2015.   
  Net income for the 2016 third quarter was $12.1 million compared with $24.7 million in the prior-year period.  Diluted earnings per share for the 2016 third quarter were $0.41 compared with $0.82 in the prior-year period. 
  CONSOLIDATED YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS 
  Consolidated sales for the first nine months of 2016 decreased by $55.9 million, or 10.4%, to $479.1 million.  Aerospace segment sales were down 1.8% year-over-year to $406.0 million, while Test Systems segment sales were down 40.0% to $73.1 million. 
  Consolidated costs of products sold decreased $29.8 million to $356.1 million from $385.9 million in the first nine months of 2015. The decrease was the result of lower sales volume.  E D costs were $67.5 million in the first nine months of 2016, up slightly from $66.1 million of E D costs in the first nine months of 2015.   As a percent of sales, E D was 14.1% and 12.4% in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
  SG A expenses were $65.2 million, or 13.6% of sales, in the first nine months of 2016 compared with $66.2 million, or 12.4% of sales, in the same period last year.  The first nine months of 2015 benefited from a $1.6 million reduction to the contingent consideration liability related to prior acquisitions.  Lower SG A expenses were due primarily to reduced commissions resulting from lower volumes. 
  The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was   29.3%  , compared with   33.0%   in the first nine months of 2015.  The tax rate in the first nine months of 2016 was favorably impacted by the permanent reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2015.   
  Net income for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $38.5 million, or $1.28 per diluted share.

AEROSPACE SEGMENT 

AEROSPACE   THIRD   QUARTER RESULTS 
  Aerospace segment sales decreased by $13.5 million, or 9.8%, when compared with the prior year s third quarter to $125.2 million. 
  The majority of the reduction in Aerospace sales was with Avionics products.  Avionics declined $6.7 million, largely due to lower sales of satellite antenna systems, which have new products in the certification process, and in-flight entertainment/cabin management systems for VVIP aircraft, which has been impacted by the decline in the global oil and gas industry, primarily in the Middle East.  Additionally, Systems Certification sales declined $3.5 million on lower project activity.  Electrical Power   Motion sales declined $2.9 million, as lower sales of in-seat power products were partially offset by an improvement in sales of seat motion products. 
   Aerospace operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 was $17.6 million, or 14.0% of sales, compared with $23.1 million, or 16.6% of sales, in the same period last year.  The decrease in operating profit was the result of lower volumes.  Aerospace E D costs were $18.9 million in the quarter compared with $19.3 million in the same period last year.  
  Aerospace orders in the third quarter of 2016 were $122.8 million, compared with orders of $129.8 million in the 2015 third quarter.  The Aerospace segment book to bill ratio for the quarter was 0.98.

AEROSPACE YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS 
  Aerospace segment sales decreased by $7.3 million, or 1.8%, when compared with the prior year s first nine months to $406.0 million.   
  Electrical Power   Motion sales grew $10.6 million, or 5.1%, largely driven by higher sales of in-seat power products and seat motion products, which were up $7.2 million and $4.9 million, respectively.  Sales of Structures products were up $3.1 million and Lighting   Safety products were up $1.6 million.  These increases were offset by an $18.9 million decline in Avionics products, which was largely due to lower sales of satellite antenna systems and lower VVIP in-flight entertainment/cabin management systems, and a $3.9 million decrease in System Certification sales. 
  Aerospace operating profit for the first nine months of 2016 was $61.1 million, or 15.0% of sales, compared with $66.7 million, or 16.1% of sales, in the same period last year.  The decrease in operating profit was the result of lower volume, coupled with higher E D costs and a general increase in operating costs.  E D costs for Aerospace were $58.3 million and $57.3 million in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Aerospace SG A expense increased $1.1 million in the first nine months of 2016 as compared with 2015.  The first nine months of 2015 included inventory step-up costs of $1.0 million that reduced normal operating margins for that period.  
   AEROSPACE OUTLOOK 
  We expect 2016 sales for our Aerospace segment to be in the range of   $539 million   to   $545 million  . The Aerospace segment s backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2016 was   $233.4 million   with approximately   $104.3 million   expected to be shipped over the remaining part of 2016 and   $206.4 million   is expected to ship over the next 12 months. 
   
  TEST SYSTEMS SEGMENT    

TEST SYSTEMS   THIRD   QUARTER RESULTS 
  Sales in the third quarter of 2016 decreased approximately $31.5 million to $29.9 million compared with the same period in 2015, a decrease of 51.3%.  Sales to the Semiconductor market decreased $33.1 million compared with the same period in 2015, which was partially offset by increased sales of $1.6 million to the Aerospace   Defense market. 
  Operating profit was $3.2 million, or 10.8% of sales, compared with $17.0 million or 27.6% of sales in last year s third quarter.  E D costs remained relatively consistent at $3.3 million and $3.2 million in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
  Orders for the Test Systems segment in the quarter were $13.7 million, down $1.7 million, or 10.8%, over the prior year period.

     Table of Contents  

TEST SYSTEMS YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS 
  Sales in the first nine months of 2016 decreased 40.0% to $73.1 million compared with sales of $121.7 million for the same period in 2015, due to lower shipments to the Semiconductor market.  Sales to the Semiconductor market decreased $52.3 million compared with the same period in 2015, which was partially offset by increased sales of $3.7 million to the Aerospace   Defense market. 
  Operating profit was $6.5 million, or 8.9% of sales, compared with $24.6 million, or 20.2% of sales, in the first nine months of 2015.  E D costs were $9.2 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared with $8.8 million in the prior year period.  
  TEST SYSTEMS OUTLOOK 
  We expect sales for the Test Systems segment for 2016 to be in the range of   $96 million   to   $100 million  . The Test Systems segment s backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2016 was   $41.8 million   with approximately   $17.6 million   expected to be shipped over the remaining part of 2016 and approximately   $36.1 million   scheduled to ship over the next 12 months. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Operating Activities: 
  Cash provided by operating activities totaled   $25.2 million   for the first   nine   months of 2016, as compared with   $43.2 million   during the same period in 2015. Cash flow from operating activities increased primarily due to the impact of decreases in net income and net operating assets for the first   nine   months of 2016 when compared with the first   nine   months of 2015. 
  Investing Activities: 
  Cash used for investing activities was   $11.5 million   for the first   nine    months of 2016 compared with   $71.1 million   used in the same period of 2015. Cash used for capital expenditures was   $9.9 million   in the first   nine   months of 2016 compared with   $15.9 million   in the prior year period. The Company expects capital spending in 2016 to be in the range of $15 million to $17 million. Cash used for the acquisition of Armstrong in January 2015 was $52.6 million. 
  Financing Activities: 
  The primary financing activities in 2016 relate to borrowings and payments on our senior credit facility to fund operations, and purchases of treasury stock as part of the buyback program announced on February 24, 2016, under which the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of common stock. 
  The Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement as amended are jointly and severally guaranteed by each domestic subsidiary of the Company other than a non-material subsidiary. The obligations are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the Company s and the guarantors  assets. 
  The Company's Credit Agreement consists of a   $350 million   revolving credit line with the option to increase the line by up to   $150 million  . On January 13, 2016, the Company amended the Agreement to add a new lender and extend the maturity date of the credit facility from September 26, 2019 to   January 13, 2021  . At   October 1, 2016   there was   $151.0 million   outstanding on the revolving credit facility and there remains   $197.9 million   available, net of outstanding letters of credit. The credit facility allocates up to   $20 million   of the   $350 million   revolving credit line for the issuance of letters of credit, including certain existing letters of credit. At   October 1, 2016  , outstanding letters of credit totaled   $1.1 million  . 
  The maximum permitted leverage ratio of funded debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Agreement) is   3.5   to 1, increasing to   4.0   to 1 for up to   two   fiscal quarters following the closing of an acquisition permitted under the Agreement. The Company will pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of the facility at a rate equal to one-, three- or six-month LIBOR plus between   137.5   basis points and   225   basis points based upon the Company s leverage ratio. The Company will also pay a commitment fee to the lenders in an amount equal to between   17.5   basis points and   35   basis points on the undrawn portion of the credit facility, based upon the Company s leverage ratio. The Company must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to interest expense) of   3.0   to 1 for the term of the Agreement. The Company s interest coverage ratio was   29.9   to 1 at   October 1, 2016  . The Company s leverage ratio was   1.52   to 1 at   October 1, 2016  .

In the event of voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of the Company or any subsidiary, all unpaid principal and other amounts owing under the Agreement automatically become due and payable. Other events of default, such as failure to make payments as they become due and breach of financial and other covenants, change of control, judgments over a certain amount, and cross default under other agreements give the Agent the option to declare all such amounts immediately due and payable. 
   
  BACKLOG 
  The Company s backlog at   October 1, 2016   was   $275.2 million   compared with $274.4 million at   December 31, 2015   and $297.0 million at   October 3, 2015  . 
   
  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS 
  The Company's contractual obligations and commercial commitments have not changed materially from those disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
  MARKET RISK 
  The Company believes that there have been no material changes in the current year regarding the market risk information for its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Although the majority of our sales, expenses and cash flows are transacted in U.S. dollars, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the Euro and the Canadian dollar. The Company believes that the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in 2016 have not been significant. 
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Refer to the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a complete discussion of the Company s critical accounting policies. 
   
  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ) which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions.  The guidance makes several modifications to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. In addition, ASU 2016-09 clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing how the adoption of this standard will impact the financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ) which requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The standard also requires additional disclosures by lessees and contains targeted changes to accounting by lessors. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be adopted at the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently assessing how the adoption of the standard will impact the financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-9,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . This new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, pursuant to the issuance of ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date   issued in August 2015. The comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, we do not expect these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any legal matter or should several legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, then the financial results of that particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 
    
  On December 29, 2010, Lufthansa Technik AG ( Lufthansa ) filed a Statement of Claim in the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany. Lufthansa s claim asserts that our subsidiary, AES sold, marketed and brought into use in Germany a power supply system which infringes upon a German patent held by Lufthansa. The relief sought by Lufthansa includes requiring AES to stop selling and marketing the allegedly infringing power supply system, a recall of allegedly infringing products sold to commercial customers since November 26, 2003 and compensation for damages. The claim does not specify an estimate of damages and a damages claim will be made by Lufthansa only if it receives a favorable ruling on the determination of infringement. The value of the dispute has been set by the Court to be    2 million  . This is an estimate of the commercial value of the matter. 
    
  On February 6, 2015, the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany rendered its decision that the patent was infringed. The judgment does not require AES to recall products which are already installed in aircraft or have been sold to other end users.  On July 15, 2015, Lufthansa advised AES of their intention to enforce the accounting provisions of the decision, which required AES to provide certain financial information regarding sales of the infringing product to enable Lufthansa to make an estimate of requested damages. Additionally, if Lufthansa provides the required bank guarantee specified in the decision, the Company may be required to offer a recall of products which are in the distribution channels in Germany. No such bank guarantee has been issued to date.  
    
  The Company appealed and believes it has valid defenses to refute the decision. The appeal was heard on October 12, 2016 at the Higher Regional Court of Karlsruhe. Should that ruling be unfavorable, the Company may choose to appeal to the Federal Supreme Court. The enforcement of the accounting provision of the decision, as discussed above, has no impact on the appeals process. As a result, we do not currently have sufficient information to provide an estimate of AES s potential exposure related to this matter. As loss exposure is neither probable nor estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of   October 1, 2016  .  The Court is scheduled to issue its decision on November 9, 2016. 
    
  On November 26, 2014, Lufthansa filed a complaint in the United States District for the Western District of Washington.  Lufthansa s complaint in this action alleges that AES manufactures, uses, sells and offers for sale a power supply system which infringes upon a U.S. patent held by Lufthansa. The patent at issue in the U.S. action is based on technology similar to that involved in the German action. On April 25, 2016, the Court issued its ruling on claim construction, holding that the sole independent claim in the patent is indefinite, rendering all claims in the patent indefinite. Based on this ruling, AES filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the Court s ruling that the patent is indefinite renders the patent invalid and unenforceable.  On July 20, 2016 the U.S. District Court granted the motion for summary judgment and issued an order dismissing all claims against AES with prejudice.  Lufthansa has filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The Company believes that it has valid defenses to Lufthansa s claims and will vigorously contest the appeal.  As loss exposure is neither probable nor estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of   October 1, 2016  . 
  Other than this proceeding, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
   
  Item 1a Risk Factors 
  In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part 1, Item 1A.
