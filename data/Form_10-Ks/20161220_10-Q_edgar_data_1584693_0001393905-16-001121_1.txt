F-3                  GRASSHOPPER STAFFING, INC.     (formerly Tomichi Creek Outfitters)      NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     OCTOBER 31, 2015     (unaudited)              NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS         Grasshopper Staffing Inc (the  Company ), formally Tomichi Creek Outfitters, was formed in the state of Nevada on June 25, 2013 and its year-end is July 31.  Our plan of operation is to provide our clients with a once in a lifetime experience to harvest a big game animal or to enjoy a guided scenic tour on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Our operations are located in Sargents, Colorado, which is approximately four hours southwest from Denver. We are nestled just west of the continental divide surrounded by 12,000 to 14,000 foot mountain peaks. This territory is remote yet accessible and rich with diverse wildlife which is adjacent to the 1.86 million acre Rio Grande National Forest.  Tomichi Creek Outfitters has access to over 500,000 acres of private land which is located adjacent to approximately 42 square miles of public land.       On March 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Business Acquisition Agreement and share exchange under which we acquired the business and assets of Grasshopper Staffing Inc ( Grasshopper Colorado ), formed in the state of Colorado on January 13, 2015. The exchange for $10,651 was represented by 250,000 shares of the Company s common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Grasshopper Colorado. The assets purchased include the logo and website, office supplies and office furniture. Grasshopper Colorado is operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.       Grasshopper Colorado was founded as a solution to the staffing needs presented in the blossoming cannabis industry in Colorado. Grasshopper Colorado is an agency that serves the Colorado's cannabis employment needs by providing employee recruiting, training, securing proper credentials and ensuring compliance with the ever-changing local and state laws. Grasshopper Colorado specializes in providing budtenders, trimmers, janitorial, security, payroll, armored transport, edible production, infusion specialists, grow consultants, irrigation, retail sales, IT solutions, web design, and event services.         NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN         The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The Company has a history of losses, an accumulated deficit, has minimal working capital and has not generated cash from its operations to support meaningful ongoing operations. In view of these matters, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon advancement of operations and to achieve a level of profitability. The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.         NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES          Basis of Presentation        The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In the opinion of the Company s management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications and non-recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly our results of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2015 and 2014 and cash flows for the three months ended October 31, 2015 and 2014 and our financial position as of October 31, 2015 have been made. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year.        F-4                      GRASSHOPPER STAFFING, INC.     (formerly Tomichi Creek Outfitters)     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     OCTOBER 31, 2015     (unaudited)              NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)         Certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual audited consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted from these interim unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly, these interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015. The July 31, 2015 balance sheet is derived from those statements.        Use of Estimates         The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the estimates of useful lives for depreciation.        Accounts Receivable        Accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers in the ordinary course of business from sales activities The Company uses the allowance method for recognizing bad debts. When an account is deemed uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance. At October 31, 2015 and July 31, 2015, the Company considered its accounts receivable to be fully collectible.        Property and Equipment        Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized while minor replacements and maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of such assets, are charged to operations as incurred. Disposals are removed at cost less accumulated depreciation, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statement of operations.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method which depreciates the assets over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets ranging from five to seven years.       Long-lived assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset.  The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required.  If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset.  The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented.        Intangible Assets        Intangible assets with definite useful lives are recorded on the basis of cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company uses a useful life of 3 years for website development. The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of intangible assets annually to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. If the estimate of the intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. At October 31, 2015, no revision to the remaining amortization period of the intangible assets was made.        F-5                  GRASSHOPPER STAFFING, INC.     (formerly Tomichi Creek Outfitters)     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     OCTOBER 31, 2015     (unaudited)              NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)          Fair Value of Financial Instruments        Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:       Level 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.       Level 2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.       Level 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.       Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and borrowings. The fair value of current financial assets and current financial liabilities approximates their carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.        Revenue Recognition        Revenue is derived from the placement of temporary workers.  The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and estimable in accordance with ASC 605,    Revenue Recognition   .  The Company will recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met:           Persuasive evidence for an agreement exists;       Service has been provided;       The fee is fixed or determinable; and,       Collection is reasonably assured.        Basic Net Loss Per Common Share        Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Dilutive loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the Company. Because the Company does not have any potentially dilutive securities, the accompanying presentation is only of basic loss per share.        Stock Based Compensation        The Company accounts for the grant of restricted stock awards in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation.  ASC 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of equity based compensation. The expense is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the compensation.  Any remaining unrecognized balance will be recognized ratably over the life of the vesting period and is a reduction of stockholders' equity.          F-6                  GRASSHOPPER STAFFING, INC.     (formerly Tomichi Creek Outfitters)     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     OCTOBER 31, 2015     (unaudited)              NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)         The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC 505-50  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.         Recent Accounting Pronouncements        We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.       In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. We are evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on the determination or reporting of its financial results.       In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period," ("ASU 2014-12"). ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. ASU 2014-12 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results.       In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements- Going Concern. The Update provides U.S. GAAP guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ended after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-15 on the consolidated financial statements.       In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of the revenue standard issued in 2014, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In response to stakeholders' requests to defer the effective date of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 and in consideration of feedback received through extensive outreach with preparers, practitioners, and users of financial statements, the FASB proposed deferring the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Respondents to the proposal overwhelmingly supported a deferral. Respondents noted that providing sufficient time for implementation of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is critical to its success. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement.            F-7                  GRASSHOPPER STAFFING, INC.     (formerly Tomichi Creek Outfitters)     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     OCTOBER 31, 2015     (unaudited)              NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)         In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that an entity classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Prior to the issuance of the standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities were required to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the basis of the classification of the related asset or liability. This ASU is effective for the Company on April 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.       On May 8, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-08,   Business Combinations (Topic 805) Pushdown Accounting   which conforms the FASB s guidance on pushdown accounting with the SEC s guidance.

There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note. As of October 31, 2015 and July 31, 2015, members of management have loaned the Company $46,326 and $16,671, respectively. The loans are payable on demand and carry no interest.       The amounts and terms of the above transactions may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts and terms that would have been incurred had comparable transactions been entered into with independent third parties.         NOTE 9 - CAPITAL STOCK         The Company is authorized to issue an aggregate of 200,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. No preferred shares have been authorized or issued. At October 31, 2015 and July 31, 2015, the Company had 17,887,500 and 16,425,000 common shares issued and outstanding, respectively.       On March 2, 2015, the Company entered into a Business Acquisition Agreement and share exchange under which the Company acquired the business and assets of Grasshopper Colorado in exchange for $10,651, which was represented by 250,000 shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the Grasshopper Colorado s common shares. The acquisition resulted in a change in management control, therefore, the investment in the subsidiary value has been eliminated.        F-9                  GRASSHOPPER STAFFING, INC.     (formerly Tomichi Creek Outfitters)     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     OCTOBER 31, 2015     (unaudited)              NOTE 9 - CAPITAL STOCK (Continued)           Shares Issued for Services:         On June 12, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved the issuance of 3,175,000 shares of common stock to various employees and consultants. The fair market value of the shares was $1,301,750 at the date of grant, of which $322,533 was recognized as an expense in the year ended July 31, 2015. The remaining balance of $979,217 has been recorded as a contra-equity account and is being amortized over the life of the employment agreements (15 - 18 months).       The Company has recorded $230,283 of consulting expense for the three months ended October 31, 2015 related to these agreements.       On August 3, 2015, the Company entered into a one-year consulting agreement with Acorn Management Partners, LLC.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will pay compensation of $10,000 a month and issue 375,000 shares of the Company s common stock due on the first day of the contract.  On August 24, 2015, these shares were issued and considered to be fully earned as of the date of issuance.  In addition, as per the agreement, the Company was to issue $75,000 in common stock to be priced at the closing bid price of the last trading day of the previous period during both the third and fourth three-month period.  As this agreement was terminated in January 2016, the additional $150,000 in common stock will not be issued.       On August 10, 2015, the Company entered into a second consulting agreement with Acorn Management Partners, LLC, with no termination date, for 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock that were issued on August 24, 2015. Under the terms of the agreement, the stock is considered to be fully earned on the date of issuance.         Shares Issued for Working Capital:         On September 28, 2015, the Company issued 50,000 shares of common stock at $0.20 per share for gross proceeds for working capital of $10,000.       On September 28, 2015, the Company issued 37,500 shares of common stock at $0.20 per share for gross proceeds for working capital of $7,500         Warrants:         On October 28, 2015, the Company entered into a one-year consulting agreement with Caro Capital LLC. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company made a commitment of $2,500 per month for six months, until the Company closed on financing. As the agreement terminated on February 18, 2016 and no financing was raised, the Company does not owe the consultant any cash compensation and therefore no accrual is shown on the balance sheet.  According to the terms of the agreement, upon execution the Company is to issue 200,000 warrants for share of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of 0.001 per share for a total purchase price of $200.  In addition, the Company is to issue, and the consultant is to purchase, 200,000 additional warrants per quarter (up to 800,000 warrants in total).

(formerly Tomichi Creek Outfitters)     NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     OCTOBER 31, 2015     (unaudited)          NOTE 9 - CAPITAL STOCK (Continued)         The fair value of the warrants issued and the significant assumptions used to determine those fair values, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows:             As of October 31, 2015, there are no options outstanding to acquire any additional shares of common stock of the Company.         NOTE 10 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES           Legal Matters         In the normal course of business, the Company may become a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company. The Company's management is unaware of any pending or threatened assertions and there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.       The Company s operations are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including financial, operational and regulatory risks, including the potential risk of business failure.         Operating Leases         The company s executive offices are located at 200 S Victoria Ave, Pueblo, Co 81003.  The property is leased on a month to month basis with a monthly rental payment of $800.           NOTE 11 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS         The Company follows the guidance in Sections 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the consolidated financial statements were issued.  Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its consolidated financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.       On January 15, 2016, the Company entered into a three-year consulting and advisory agreement. Compensation consists of a monthly retainer fee of $20,000. In addition, for services rendered through January 15, 2016, the Company issued on March 15, 2016, 8,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at a purchase price of $0.01 per share. The first month s retainer was reduced by the $8,000 for the compensation shares resulting in a net payment of $12,000 for month one.        On March 29, 2016, the Company issued 6,000,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock as satisfaction for $6,000 in compensation that was owed to Acorn Management Partners, LLC.  The warrants have a term of ten years and an exercise price of $0.01.       On February 18, 2016, the Company terminated the agreement dated October 28, 2015 with Caro Capital LLC.  As a result of the termination of the agreement, the warrants were cancelled and 400,000 shares of common stock valued at $10,000 were issued by the Company as compensation for four months of service.            F-11                       Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.         The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 1  Financial Statements  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled  Risk Factors  included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.         Business Overview        Grasshopper Staffing Inc (the  Grasshopper Staffing ), formally Tomichi Creek Outfitters was formed in the state of Nevada on June 25, 2013.  We are a development stage company with a plan of operation to provide clients with an opportunity to harvest a trophy size elk or deer or to enjoy a guided scenic tour on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains.  Our operations are located in Sargents, Colorado which is approximately four hours southwest from Denver.  We are located just west of the continental divide surrounded by 12,000 to 14,000-foot mountain peaks.  This territory is remote yet accessible with diverse wildlife which is adjacent to the 1.86 million acre Rio Grande National Forest.  Grasshopper Staffing s primary business is offering professionally guided Elk or Deer animal hunts.  This area of the country is home to trophy size Elk and Mule Deer.  Our secondary business includes offering guided scenic tours.  Every season offers an opportunity to view diverse wildlife and scenic views for every season of the year.  We plan to offer guided options in addition to providing maps and information on where clients can locate what they are interested in if they wish to trek on their own.       On March 2, 2015, we entered into a Business Acquisition Agreement under which we acquired the business and assets of Grasshopper Staffing in exchange for 250,000 shares of common stock. The assets purchased include the trademark and website, office supplies and office furniture.  Grasshopper is operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary.       Grasshopper Staffing was founded in 2015 as a solution to the staffing needs presented in the blossoming cannabis industry in Colorado. Grasshopper Staffing is an agency that serves the Colorado's cannabis employment needs by providing employee recruiting, training, securing proper credentials and ensuring compliance with local and state laws. Grasshopper Staffing specializes in providing budtenders, trimmers, janitorial, security, payroll, armored transport, edible production, infusion specialists, grow consultants, irrigation, retail sales, IT solutions, web design and event services.        Plan of Operation        Company management and affiliated business development consultants plan to leverage our extensive operational, industry, M A and finance contacts and experience to quickly expand upon the foundation recently established at Grasshopper Staffing.  We plan to greatly increase our staffing efforts in both the cannabis and non-cannabis space through existing business expansion and acquisitions. Potential cannabis acquisition targets have been identified in Colorado, as well as addition states where cannabis has been legalized for medical or recreational usage with plans for an eventual national footprint. In addition, staffing companies outside of the cannabis space have also been identified as potential acquisition targets, which will allow for diverse sources of revenue. To further our diversification, the company plans to pursue additional acquisition targets within the cannabis space, including businesses specializing in security, testing, proprietary growing equipment, comprehensive facility consulting, facility leasing and unique social media entities. To this end, in the near future  Grasshopper Staffing  will change its name to simply  Grasshopper  to better reflect its plans to aggressively grow into the preeminent multifaceted cannabis company in the fastest growing business space in the United States today.                    2                      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         Results of Operations          For the three months ended October 31, 2015 compared to 2015         The Company had $96,267 and $0 of revenue during the three months ended October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $96,267 was due to revenue achieved by contract staffing services.        General and Administrative Expenses        The Company s general and administrative expenses were incurred in the amounts of $869,265 and $2,231 for the three months ended October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This increase of $867,304 was primarily due to an increase in professional fees along with an increase in payroll and related expenses.        Net Loss        The comparable net loss for the three months ended October 31, 2015, as compared to the net loss for the three months ended October 31, 2014, was $830,747 and $2,231, respectively. This increased net loss was due primarily to the increase in general and administrative expenses, particularly professional fees and payroll and related expenses.        Liquidity and Capital Resources         Working Capital              Current assets for the quarter ended October 31, 2015 increased marginally compared to July 31, 2015.       Current liabilities for the quarter ended October 31, 2015 increased compared to July 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in loans from management during the quarter ended October 31, 2015.        Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities        Net cash used in operations was $64,756 for the three months ended October 31, 2015 compared to $14,781 for the three months ended October 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net loss during the three months ended October 31, 2015, offset by an increase in stock compensation expense and an increase in common stock issued for services in the three months ended October 31, 2015.        Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities        Cash flows provided by financing activities for the three months ended October 31, 2015 were $47,155 compared to $0 for three months ended October 31, 2014. During the three months ended October 31, 2015, we had proceeds from shareholder loans of $30,955 as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $17,500.                    3                  Going Concern        At October 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,215,948 and incurred a net loss of $830,747 for the three-month period ended October 31, 2015.  We expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all of which casts substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.       We have generated minimal revenues and have incurred losses since inception. Accordingly, we will be dependent on future additional financing in order to finance operations and growth.                 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements        The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2015.            Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.        As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.          Item 4. Controls and Procedures.         Disclosure Controls and Procedures        We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures , as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.       As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated our company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.        Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting        Our management, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and our Board of Directors, is responsible for establishing and maintaining a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.       Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016.  Our management s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of October 31, 2016 due to the following material weaknesses which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.            4                 To remediate such weaknesses, we believe we would need to implement the following changes: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may not be undertaken. Until we have the required funds, we do not anticipate implementing these remediation steps.       A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.       Our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additional controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.        Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting        There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.                                                                                            5                        PART II - OTHER INFORMATION           Item 1. Legal Proceedings.        We are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.          Item 1A.  Risk Factors.        We believe there are no changes that constitute material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report for July 31, 2015 on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on November 23, 2016.          Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.        On August 3, 2015, the Company entered into a one-year consulting agreement with Acorn Management Partners, LLC.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company issued 375,000 shares of the Company s common stock due on the first day of the contract.       On August 10, 2015, the Company entered into a second consulting agreement with Acorn Management Partners, LLC.

There has been no default in the payment of principal, interest, sinking or purchase fund installment, or any other material default, with respect to any indebtedness of the Company.          Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.        Not applicable.          Item 5. Other Information.
