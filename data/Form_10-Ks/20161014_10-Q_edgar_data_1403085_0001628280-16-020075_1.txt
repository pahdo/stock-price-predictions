  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

(1)   General 
    
  JRjr33, Inc. ("JRJR" or "the Company", and together with the Company's consolidated subsidiaries, "we", "us" and "our") was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in April 2007. The Company changed its name to JRjr33, Inc. on March 7, 2016 and began doing business as JRjr Networks, using the stock symbol JRJR in January 2016. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes include the Company's accounts and the accounts of the Company's subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Business combinations accounted for as purchases are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) which are, in the Company's opinion, necessary for a fair presentation of the information as of and for the periods presented. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all disclosures required under GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the "2015 Form 10-K".) The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used by us could have a significant impact on our financial results. Actual results could differ from those estimates. All amounts have been presented in USD currency unless otherwise noted. 

The Company's Portfolio 
    
  The Company has grown as a result of acquisitions and intend to continue to pursue additional acquisitions that improve the fundamental strength of the existing business. The Company's platform of direct-to-consumer brands is currently comprised of the following nine businesses in order of acquisition: The Longaberger Company ("Longaberger" or  TLC ), Your Inspiration at Home Proprietary Limited ( Your Inspiration at Home  or  YIAH ), CVSL TBT LLC ("Tomboy Tools" or "TBT"), Agel Enterprises Inc. ( Agel  or "AEI"), My Secret Kitchen Limited ("My Secret Kitchen" or  MSK ), Paperly, Inc. ( Paperly ), Uppercase Living, Inc. ("Uppercase Living"), Kleeneze Limited ( Kleeneze ) and Betterware Limited ("Betterware"). In addition, Happenings Communications Group, Inc. ("Happenings" or "HCG") further diversifies the portfolio by operating in the magazine publishing industry. 

(2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Consolidation 
    
  The Company consolidates all entities in which it owns or controls more than   50%   of the voting shares, including any investments where the Company has determined to have control. The portion of the entity not owned by us is reflected as a non-controlling interest within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. As of   March 31, 2016  , the non-controlling interest consisted of minority shareholder interests in TLC, certain international subsidiaries of Agel and MSK. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

8 

Significant Accounting Policies  
    
  There have been no material changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the   three months ended     March 31, 2016  , as compared with those disclosed in the Company s consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2015 have been reclassified to conform to current period's presentation. The Company has reclassified select expenditures to show a consistent presentation as well as changing the presentation on the condensed consolidated statement of operations to show selling expenses separate from general and administrative expenses. None of the adjustments had any effect on the prior period net loss. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates and assumptions in these condensed financial statements require the exercise of judgment and are used for, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and obsolescence, estimates of future cash flows and other assumptions associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, allocation of purchase price to the fair value of net assets acquired, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, revenue recognition, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, lease classification and contingencies. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the condensed financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash equivalents are short-term, highly-liquid instruments with original maturities of ninety days or less. The Company maintains cash primarily with multinational banks. The amounts held in interest bearing accounts periodically exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit of   $250,000  . The amounts held in banks that are FDIC insured total   $192,000   and   $340,000   at the end of   March 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The insured limit of   $250,000   was not exceeded by any individual FDIC insured account in either period. The Company has not incurred any losses related to these deposits. 
    
  Marketable Securities 
    
  Investments in marketable securities may include equity securities, debt instruments and mutual funds. Securities classified as available for sale are those securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time but not necessarily to maturity. Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income and realized gains and losses reported separately on the statement of operations. 
    
  Accounts Receivable 
    
  The carrying value of our accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on type of customer, age of outstanding receivable, historical collection trends, and existing economic conditions. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that a specific receivable balance may be unrealizable, further consideration is given to the collectability of those balances, and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. Receivable balances deemed not collectible are written off against the allowance. The Company has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately   $972,000   and   $1,028,000   at   March 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Inventory 
    
  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. The Company records provisions for obsolete, excess and unmarketable inventory in cost of goods sold. 

9 

Assets Held for Sale 
    
  The Company classifies assets as held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan of sale with the expectation that the sale will be completed within one year. The net assets of the business held for sale are then recorded at the lower of their current carrying value or the fair market value, less costs to sell. See additional discussion regarding the Company s assets held for sale in   Note (6)  . 
    
  Property, Plant and Equipment 
    
  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Provisions for amortization of leasehold improvements are made at annual rates based upon the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or terms of the leases. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. 
    
  At   March 31, 2016  , the useful lives used for depreciation and amortization were as follows: 

Leases 
    
  Leases are contractual agreements between lessees and lessors in which lessees get the right to use leased assets for a specified period in exchange for regular payments. Capital leases resemble asset purchases because there is an implied transfer of the benefits and risks of ownership from lessor to lessee, and the lessee is responsible for repairs and maintenance. The Company treats asset leases as capital leases if the life of the lease exceeds 75 percent of the asset's useful life, there is an ownership transfer to the lessee at the end of the lease, there is a "bargain" purchase option at the end of the lease or the discounted present value of the lease payments exceeds 90 percent of the fair-market value of the asset at the beginning of the lease term. Capital lease obligations, and the related assets, are recorded at the commencement of the lease based on the present value of the minimum lease payments. Property under capital leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life. 
    
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  The Company's management reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets with definite lives for impairment in accordance with accounting guidance. Management determines whether there has been an impairment of long-lived assets held for use in the business by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying value of the asset. The amount of any resulting impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value. Long-lived assets that meet the definition of held for sale, when present, are valued at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. Assets or asset groups are determined at the lowest level possible for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. 
    
  Business Combinations 
    
  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as of the acquisition date - the date on which control of the acquired company is transferred to the Company. Control is assessed by considering the legal transfer of voting rights that are currently exercisable and managerial control of the entity. Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date by taking the fair value of the consideration transferred and subtracting the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Transaction costs - other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities - related to a business combination are expensed as incurred. 
    
  Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
    
  Goodwill arising from business combinations, if applicable, represents the excess of the purchase prices over the value assigned to the net acquired assets and other specifically identified intangibles. Specifically identified intangibles generally include trade names, trademarks, and other intellectual property. 
  
   10 

The Company's management performs its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible impairment test annually or when changes in circumstances indicate an impairment event may have occurred by estimating the fair value of each reporting unit compared to its carrying value. The last annual impairment analysis was performed as of November 30, 2015. 
    
  Goodwill is measured for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. 
    
  Indefinite-lived assets are measured for impairment by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying value. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. 
    
  The Company uses a discounted cash flow model and a market approach to calculate the fair value of reporting units. The model includes a number of significant assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and these estimates could be materially impacted by adverse changes in market conditions.  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company is subject to tax in many jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Likewise, we are subject to audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions. In such audits, our interpretation of tax legislation may be challenged and tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with, and subsequently challenge, the amount of profits taxed in such jurisdictions under our inter-company agreements. 
    
  Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between financial statement and tax bases of asset and liabilities. The Company maintains a full valuation allowance for domestic and foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. The Company records income tax positions, including those that are uncertain, based on a more likely than not threshold that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities having full knowledge of all relevant information.  
    
  Translation of Foreign Currencies 
    
  The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of their country of domicile. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollar amounts at period-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenditures are translated at the weighted-average rates for the quarterly accounting period to which they relate. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive income. 
    
  Management has determined the functional currency of each primary operating subsidiary by evaluating indicators such as cash flows, sales prices, sales markets, expenses, financing, and intra-entity transactions and arrangements. The Company has listed below the functional and reporting currencies for each subsidiary.

Fair Value 
    
  The Company established a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. These levels are determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1 represents unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 represents quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets (other than those included in Level 1) which are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 represents valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
    
  Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
  The Company reports comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed statements of comprehensive income (loss). Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) plus gains and losses affecting stockholders  equity that are excluded from net income (loss), such as gains and losses related to available for sale marketable securities and the translation effect of foreign currency assets and liabilities. 
    
  Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company receives payments - primarily via credit card - for the sale of products at the time customers place orders. Sales and related fees such as shipping and handling, net of applicable sales discounts, are recorded as revenue when the product is shipped and when title and the risk of ownership passes to the customer. The Company presents revenue net of any taxes collected from customers which are remitted to governmental authorities. Payments received for undelivered products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in current liabilities on the Company s condensed balance sheets. Certain incentives offered on the sale of our products, including sales discounts, described in the paragraph below, are classified as program costs and discounts. A provision for product returns and allowances is recorded and is founded on historical experience and is classified as a reduction of revenues. For the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015  , our provision for sales returns totaled approximately   $184,000   and   $86,000  , respectively. 
    
  Program costs and discounts 
    
  Program costs and discounts represent the various methods of promoting our products. The Company offers benefits such as discounts on starter kits for new consultants, promotional pricing for the host of a home show, which vary depending on the value of the orders placed, and general discounts on our products. 
    
  Cost of Sales 
    
  Cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials, finished goods, inbound shipping expenses, and the direct and indirect costs associated with the personnel, resources and property, plant and equipment related to the manufacturing and inventory management functions. 
    
  Commissions and Incentives 
    
  Commissions and incentives include all forms of commissions, overrides and incentives related to the sales force. The Company accrues expenses for incentive trips over qualification periods as they are earned. The Company analyzes incentive trip accruals based on historical and current sales trends as well as contractual obligations when evaluating the adequacy of the incentive trip accruals. Actual results could result in liabilities being more or less than the amounts recorded. 
    
  Selling Expense 
    
  Selling expenses include merchant fees, freight out shipping expenses, distribution supplies as well as other distribution related expenses.  
    
  General and Administrative Expense 
    
  General and administrative expenses include wages and related benefits associated with various administrative departments, including human resources, legal, information technology, finance and executive, as well as professional fees and administrative facility costs associated with leased buildings. 

12 

Depreciation and Amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation related to owned buildings, office equipment and supplies, warehousing, and order fulfillment. In addition, it also includes the amortization of leasehold improvements and intangibles. The depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment as well as depreciation associated to inventory management are included in cost of sales. 
    
  Share-based Compensation 
    
  The Company's share-based compensation plans include cash-settled plans, stock options, and warrants. Cash settled plans are treated as liability awards, with payments determined based on changes in the trading prices of the Company's common stock. Stock options and warrants are generally evaluated using a Black-Scholes model, with expenses recorded on a straight-line basis over the required period of service. 
    
  Operating Expenditures 
    
  The Company evaluates operating expenditures to view holistically the expenditures that the Company incurs to engage in any activities not directly associated with the production of goods or services. Operating expenditures include commissions and incentives; selling expenses; general and administrative expenses; share-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; gain or loss on sale of assets; impairment of goodwill; and any additional impairments of assets. 
    
  Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share 
    
  The computation of basic earnings (loss) per common share is based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding in accordance with current accounting guidance. 
    
  Outstanding stock options and warrants, and convertible notes, are not included in the computation of dilutive loss per common share because the Company has experienced operating losses in all periods presented and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02),   Leases.   This new standard is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim reporting periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is in the process of assessing the effects of the application of the new guidance on our financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09),   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The ASU simplifies several aspects of employee share-based payment accounting, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance will become effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the effects of the application of the new guidance on our financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Subsequently, FASB issued ASUs in 2016 containing implementation guidance related to ASU 2014-09, including: ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations; ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which is intended to clarify two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance; and ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which contains certain practical expedients in response to identified implementation issues. This guidance will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt these ASUs. Management is currently evaluating these ASUs, including which transition approach to use, if needed. The Company does not expect these ASUs to materially impact the Company's consolidated net income, financial position or cash flows.

A variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various regulatory agencies. Due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, management has not determined whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material to the condensed financial statements.

  Kleeneze  
    
  On March 24, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Kleeneze, a direct-to-consumer business based in the United Kingdom. Kleeneze offers a wide variety of cleaning, health, beauty, home, outdoor and other products to customers across the United Kingdom and Ireland.  
    
  Upon conclusion of the purchase price allocation in the third quarter of 2015, the Company realized a   $3.6 million   gain on the acquisition, which was recorded to "Gain on acquisition of a business" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The transaction resulted in a gain primarily due to the significantly low purchase price, which is a result of the continual declines in revenues and operating profits Kleeneze had seen prior to the acquisition. 
    
  Pro-forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations 
    
  The following unaudited pro-forma financial information presents the Company's condensed financial results for the   three   months ended   March 31, 2015   as if the Betterware and Kleeneze acquisitions had occurred as of January 1, 2015 (in thousands, except per share data): 

Notes to Pro-forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:

The pro-forma results include the following adjustments: 

Losses were incurred by Kleeneze as a result of the write down of intercompany receivables in the amount of   $33.1 million   that were forgiven prior to and in accordance with the transaction. As these losses were direct and one-time events related specifically to the acquisition, the Company has excluded these items from the pro-forma results above; and 
                
    The pro-forma results above exclude transaction costs related to the   two   acquisitions that were expensed in   2015  .

(8)   Goodwill and Other Assets 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  The Company's management performs its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests annually as of November 30, 2015 or when changes in circumstances indicate an impairment event may have occurred by estimating the fair value of each reporting unit compared to its carrying value. The Company is aggregated into   four   operating segments presented herein (  Note (17)  ) based on similar economic characteristics, nature of products and services, nature of production processes, type of customers and distribution methods. Our four operating segments consist of: 1) gourmet food, 2) home d cor, 3) nutritional and wellness and 4) other. 
    
  The Company uses a discounted cash flow model and a market approach to calculate the fair value of our reporting units. The models include a number of significant assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and these estimates could be materially impacted by adverse changes in market conditions. Goodwill is measured for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. 
    
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company impaired the goodwill related to the acquisition of Tomboy Tools. The Company's impairment charges totaled approximately   $191,000   and   $0   for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

(9)   Related Party Transactions 
    
  During the fourth quarter of   2015  , the Company renewed a Reimbursement of Services Agreement for a minimum of one year with Richmont Holdings - a closely held company by the Company's Chairman and CEO. The Company has begun to establish an infrastructure of personnel and resources necessary to identify, analyze, negotiate and conduct due diligence on direct-to-consumer acquisition candidates. However, the Company continues to need advice and assistance in areas related to identification, analysis, financing, due diligence, negotiations and other strategic planning, accounting, tax and legal matters associated with such potential acquisitions. Richmont Holdings and its affiliates have experience in these areas and the Company wishes to draw upon such experience. In addition, Richmont Holdings had already developed a strategy of acquisitions in the direct-to-consumer industry and has assigned and transferred to us the opportunities it has previously analyzed and pursued. The Company has agreed to pay Richmont Holdings a reimbursement fee (the  Reimbursement Fee ) each month and the Company agreed to reimburse or pay the substantial due diligence, financial analysis, legal, travel and other costs Richmont Holdings incurred in identifying, analyzing, performing due diligence, structuring and negotiating potential transactions. During the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded approximately   $480,000   and   $504,000   of expenses that relate to the Reimbursement Fee, respectively, that are included in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. On February 26, 2015 the Company received a loan from Richmont Capital Partners V ( RCP V ) in the amount of   $425,000  . The loan does not currently bear interest and has no set maturity date. As of   March 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was a related party payable balance of approximately   $546,000   and   $576,000   due to Richmont Holdings included in related party payables on the Company's balance sheet, respectively.

On June 27, 2014, Tamala L. Longaberger lent TLC   $42,000   and in connection therewith   TLC   issued a promissory note in the principal amount of   $42,000   to her. The note bears interest at the rate of   10.0%   per annum and matured on   June 27, 2015  . This amount is included in related-party payables within current liabilities.  
    
  On July 1, 2014, Tamala L. Longaberger lent AEI   $158,000   and in connection therewith   AEI   issued a promissory note in the principal amount of   $158,000   to her.

This amount is included in related-party payables within current liabilities.  
    
  The Company determined not to service the loans related to Tamala L. Longaberger. As a result, in connection with these notes, Ms. Longaberger on   August 12, 2015   filed an action in Franklin County Common Pleas Court of Columbus, Ohio ( State Court Action ) seeking re-payment of the notes.  However, it is the Company s position that her claims are inextricably tied to the broader issues related to her terminated employment and the claims asserted against her by the Company and The Longaberger Company, including breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence, conversion, misappropriation of company funds, civil theft, breach of contract, and misappropriation of trade secrets, in an arbitration action in Columbus Ohio.  Therefore, on   October 12, 2015  , the Company filed a motion to compel arbitration and dismiss claims in the State Court Action.On July 5, 2016, the Court overruled the Company s motion and on July 26, 2016, Ms. Longaberger filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings against AEI.  On August 9, 2016 the Company filed both a memorandum contra of Ms. Longaberger s motion on the pleadings and its first amended answer, affirmative defenses and counterclaims. On August 17, 2016, the Court eliminated the trial setting and further stated it will issue a new case schedule upon conclusion of the arbitration scheduled for December 2016.  On August 18, 2016 Ms. Longaberger withdrew her motion for judgment on the pleadings. 
    
  The Company utilizes third party manufacturers for some of our products and manufacture certain products ourselves, such as food products sold in Australia and baskets sold by TLC. The Company utilizes the production capabilities of Actitech, a   600,000   square foot manufacturing facility in Sherman, Texas, which is owned by Michael Bishop, a member of our Board of Directors, to produce products for Agel that are being sold globally. The Company paid Actitech for product purchased during   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   2015   totaling approximately   $580,000   and   $43,000  , respectively. 

(10)   Income Taxes 
    
  As of   March 31, 2016  , the Company did not have a history of earnings that would allow it to record any of its net deferred tax assets without a corresponding valuation allowance. Therefore,   no   net deferred tax asset is reflected as of   March 31, 2016  . Additionally, due to some of its historical acquisitions which included intangibles with an indefinite life that are amortized for tax purposes, the Company continues to accumulate a deferred tax liability which is recorded outside the net deferred tax asset and valuation allowance. A deferred tax liability is recorded within non-current liabilities in the amounts of   $749,000   and   $744,000   in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   March 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Current tax expense for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015   was   $46,000   and   $158,000  , respectively and is based on the Company's activities in certain foreign jurisdictions which are currently profitable and for which   no   loss carryover is available to offset the income. The deferred tax expense for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015   was approximately   $31,000   and   $33,000  , respectively.

Convertible Note Dominion Capital 
    
  On November 20, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Dominion Capital ("Dominion"), pursuant to which the Company issued a   $4.0 million   senior secured note. The note bears interest at   9.75%   per annum, payable monthly. The note's principal is payable in monthly installments of   $50,000   starting in March 2016, increasing to   $325,000   in January 2017, with a final payment of   $2.2   million due in May 2017. The note is convertible at the option of Dominion into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of   $3.00   per share and is secured by the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, subject to existing senior security interests of other lenders. The Company has evaluated the conversion feature and determined that it does not need to be bifurcated from the note and accounted for separately, since it is eligible for the derivative scope exception under ASC 815-10. The Company also determined that there is no beneficial conversion feature since the effective conversion price is higher than the market price of the underlying common stock as the commitment date. 
    
  In connection with this financing,   375,000   shares of our common stock valued at   $510,000   were issued and other costs and fees totaling   $583,000   were paid. These amounts have been treated as reductions of the proceeds received or issuance costs, and are being amortized over the term of the note using the effective interest method. 
    
  The unamortized balance of the debt discount, fees and issuance costs have been offset against the principal amount of the related debt in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  The Dominion senior secured note contained certain covenants including the covenant requirement for the timely filing of the Company s filings with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). The Company missed the timely filing requirement with the SEC of its 2015 Form 10-K and received a waiver (the  Form 10-K Waiver ) from Dominion until April 25, 2016. After April 25, 2016, the Form 10-K waiver stayed active provided that the Company issued   50,000   shares for each ten (  10  ) business days until it filed its 2015 Form 10-K in compliance with its requirements under the Exchange Act. The 2015 Form 10-K was filed with the SEC on June 28, 2016, which resulted in the Company issuing a total of   200,000   shares of common stock to Dominion in connection with the Form 10-K Waiver. 
    
  A second waiver from Dominion (the  March Form 10-Q Waiver ) was received on May 17, 2016 for the Company s failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 (the  March Form 10-Q ). The March Form 10-Q Waiver stayed active provided that the Company issued to Dominion   50,000   shares of the Company s common stock for each such   ten   (10) business day period required beyond May 23, 2016,which was the due date of the March Form 10-Q (without regard to whether the Company requires the full   ten   (10) business day period for any given extension). As a result of the failure  
  
   20 

to timely file the March Form 10-Q, the Company issued a total of   500,000   shares of its common stock to Dominion in consideration of the March Form 10-Q Waiver. In addition, the filing of this report cures the event of default under the note with respect to the required timely filing of the March Form 10-Q. 
    
  In connection with the delay in the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (the  June Form 10-Q ) with the SEC, the Company obtained from Dominion an irrevocable waiver dated August 22, 2016 (the  Third Waiver ) that the Company s failure to timely file the June Form 10-Q, as well any failure to timely file the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (the  September Form 10-Q ), would not constitute an event of default under the Note, and that any further notice to Dominion under the Note in respect of the same would not be required, provided that the Company issues to Dominion   50,000   shares of its common stock for each extension period required beyond August 22, 2016 with respect to the June Form 10-Q and beyond November 21, 2016 with respect to the September Form 10-Q (without regard to whether the Company requires the full ten (10) business day period for any given extension). To date, the Company has issued   150,000   shares of its common stock for its failure to timely file its June Form 10-Q.  
    
  In addition, the Third Waiver also provides that the Company s failure to comply with any other covenant set forth in Section 14 of the Note would not constitute an event of default under the Note, and that any further notice to Dominion under the Note in respect of the same would not be required; provided that the Company issues to Dominion   100,000   shares of its common stock; provided that such Waiver shall not apply to any compliance failures that occur after January 1, 2017. 
    
  In connection with the failure to timely file the 2015 Form 10-K, the March Form 10-Q and the June Form 10-Q, the Company has issued an aggregate of   950,000   shares of its common stock in 2016 to Dominion. 
    
  In addition, the Third Waiver amended the amortization of debt. The amended amortization resulted in   $550,000   of principal previously scheduled to be paid in 2016, is now scheduled to be paid in 2017.  
    
  Convertible Notes Payable to Former Shareholders of Stanley House 
    
  On October 15, 2015, the Company issued two unsecured convertible notes totaling   $5.8   million at that time in connection with the acquisition of Betterware, maturing after three years. The notes are denominated in pounds sterling (GBP) and bear interest at   2%   per annum, payable at the time of principal payments. The notes' principal is payable in monthly installments totaling   $16,000   for the first six months, followed by monthly installments totaling   $32,000   for the next   30   months, with additional payments of   $1.6   million due at the end of each annual period following the notes' issuance. The notes may be converted into the Company's common stock at our election based on the value of our shares at the time of payment. The valuation of the notes was considered in connection with the Betterware acquisition, and were determined to have been issued at fair value on the acquisition date. Refer to   Note (3)  .

(12)   Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Commitments  
    
  Minimum lease commitments for non-cancelable operating leases for the years ended December 31, are as follows (in thousands): 

The leases for certain of the Company's facilities include rent escalation provisions, which are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms for purposes of determining rental expense.  
    
  Capital Leases 
    
  On July 31, 2014, TLC entered into a Sale Leaseback Agreement with CFI NNN Raiders. The lease was deemed to qualify as a capital lease and the transaction is being accounted for as a sale leaseback arrangement. The gain arising from the sale of the three buildings and related property has been deferred and is being recognized using the full accrual method over the term of the lease. The lease has been classified as a capital lease since the condition was met whereby the term of the lease is greater than 75% of the estimated economic life of the property. TLC has recorded the sale and removed the properties sold and related liabilities from the balance sheet. Since the lease is a capital lease, a leased asset has been recorded and depreciated over fifteen (  15  ) years using the straight-line method. 
    
  The payments under the lease are accounted for as interest and principal payments under the capital lease using a fifteen (15) year amortization. Interest expense recognized for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   2015   was   $559,000   and   $552,000  , respectively. Amortization expense of   $263,000   and   $263,000   was recorded in the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   2015   respectively. The gain on sales of real estate amortized over the life of the lease was   $42,000   for   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   $42,000   for the   three   months ended   March 31, 2015  , and is included in gain on sale of assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. On   March 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the current portion of the lease totaled   $93,000   and   $73,000  , respectively. 
    
  In addition to the sale leaseback agreement, the Company has various other capital leases. The leases cover software, hardware, and office equipment. Multiple new leases have been recognized during   2015   in part due to the acquisition of Betterware. Amortization expense related to these additional capital leases totaled   $37,000   and   $0   for   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015  , respectively. On   March 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the current portion of the other leases totaled   $101,000   and   $125,000  , respectively. The current portion of capital leases is included in 'Other current liabilities.'

Contingencies 
    
  During 2014, Tamala L. Longaberger loaned a total of   $1,000,000   to the Company, bearing interest at   10%   and maturing in 2015. The Company determined to not service the loans related to Tamala L. Longaberger. In connection with these notes, Ms. Longaberger on August 12, 2015 filed an action in Franklin County Common Pleas Court of Columbus, Ohio ( State Court Action ) seeking re-payment of the notes. However, it is the Company s position that her claims are inextricably tied to the broader issues related to her terminated employment and the claims asserted against her by the Company and The Longaberger Company, including breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence, conversion, misappropriation of company funds, civil theft, breach of contract, and misappropriation of trade secrets. As a result of her misconduct, the Company claims it is owed damages in amounts that exceed and therefore offset Ms. Longaberger s claims. Therefore, on October 12, 2015, the Company filed a motion to compel arbitration and dismiss claims in the State Court Action. On July 5, 2016, the Court overruled the Company s motion and on July 26, 2016, Ms. Longaberger filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings against AEI. On August 9, 2016 the Company filed both a memorandum contra of Ms. Longaberger s motion on the pleadings and its first amended answer, affirmative defenses and counterclaims. On August 17, 2016, the Court eliminated the trial setting and further stated it will issue a new case schedule upon conclusion of the arbitration scheduled for December 2016. On August 18, 2016 Ms. Longaberger withdrew her motion for judgment on the pleadings. As of   March 31, 2016   the Company has recorded a liability of   $1,000,000   which is included in related party payables on the balance sheet. 
    
  The Company has recorded a payable of   $560,000   related to an amended tax increment financing agreement that TLC entered into on April 3, 2007 related to the development of the infrastructure surrounding corporate headquarters. Due to this liability not being disclosed during the due diligence, the Company has filed a complaint against the seller on September 22, 2016. This complaint may potentially result in the reimbursement of or the assumption of this liability by the seller. This contingent asset is not included on the balance sheet. 
    
  The Company is disputing a tax and penalty assessment by the Spanish Taxing Authorities relating to Agel. Prior to the Company's acquisition of the assets of Agel Enterprises LLC, Agel was assessed withholding taxes and income taxes along with penalties by the Spanish Tax Authorities, which asserted that Agel had maintained permanent establishment in Spain for the years 2008 to 2010. As part of the acquisition, the Company agreed to assume this liability. Agel, has vigorously disputed these claims on the basis that Agel believes they did not have permanent establishment, and therefore, any compensation paid to independent representatives should not have been subject to withholding taxes. 
    
  AEI filed an appeal in Tribunal Econ mico-Administrativo Regional de Catalu a. The ultimate resolution of the dispute cannot be determined at this time. Agel paid the income tax due and AEI has paid approximately   $269,000   in good faith towards the disputed withholding tax liability to preserve the appeal process. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2014, AEI paid   $420,000   to the Spanish Taxing Authorities toward its outstanding tax assessment. The Company did not make any payments in the third or fourth quarters of 2014. Although the Company has appealed this assessment by the Spanish Taxing Authorities and are defending the position, this payment was made to prevent the Spanish Taxing Authorities from beginning certain legal proceedings that would have negatively affected AEI s European operations. Additionally, AEI has been assessed amounts owed for late interest on the withholding and income tax of    10,819   and    1,282  , respectively (  $11,799   and   $1,398  , respectively). The amount remains due if the appeal is unsuccessful, otherwise the payments made to date will be refunded to us. As of   March 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   AEI maintained a liability of   $0.5 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, in accrued liabilities for this disputed amount, which is reflected in the condensed financial statements. 

23 

The Company is occasionally involved in other lawsuits and disputes arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon advice of counsel, the likelihood of an adverse outcome against the Company is not subject to reasonable estimation. However, management believes that the ultimate outcome of any lawsuits will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. Other than the above, the Company is not aware of any material, active, pending or threatened proceeding against the Company, nor is the Company involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. 
    
  Worker s Compensation Liability 
    
  Certain of the Company s employees were covered under a self-insured worker s compensation plan which was replaced by a fully insured plan in December 2014. The Company estimates its remaining self-insured worker s compensation liability based on past claims experience, and has an accrued liability to cover estimated future costs. The accrued liability was approximately   $1.1 million   at   March 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . There can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from the Company's estimates. 

(13)   Fair Value (change handle building to a separate manufacturing site) 
    
  The Company established a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. These levels are determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Levels within the hierarchy are defined as follows: 
    
  Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
    
  Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets (other than those included in Level 1) which are observable, either directly or indirectly; and 
    
  Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
    
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable trade and related party payables are considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to the immediate or short-term nature or maturity. Our available for sale securities (Level 1) was   $3.0   million and (Level 2)   $0   at   March 31, 2016   and (Level 1) was   $5.3   million and (Level 2) was   $0   on   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The Company measures certain non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are recognized or disclosed on a nonrecurring basis (e.g. impaired goodwill and property, plant and equipment classified as held for sale). During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, a     $3.3 million   impairment charge was recorded for the Longaberger facilities held for sale. The facilities held for sale served as the previous corporate headquarters, day care center, and a separate manufacturing site. The fair value of the net assets to be sold was determined using Level 3 inputs utilizing a market participant bid. See additional discussion regarding the Company s assets held for sale in   Note (6)  .  
    
  During the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015  , the Company recorded goodwill impairment charge of   $191,000   and   $0  , respectively.  
    
  In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, we recorded certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis related primarily to write-downs associated with goodwill and other intangible assets.The fair value measurement for goodwill and other intangible assets was developed using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) utilizing a discounted cash flow model.

The Company has estimated the fair value of our debt and capital lease obligations using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, and they are summarized as follows (in thousands):  

(14)   Share-Based Compensation Plans 
    
  The Company has   two   cash-settled, share-based compensation plans, the 2013 Director Smart Bonus Unit Plan and 2013 Smart Bonus Unit Award Plan. These plans provide for the issuance of a cash bonus for stock appreciation. A Committee comprised of members of the Board of Directors approves all awards that are granted under our share-based compensation plan. The Company classifies the awards as a liability as the value of the award will be settled in cash, notes, or stock. The Company awarded   5,000   equivalent shares of stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) in   2016   that are measured each reporting period and are recognized pro-rata over the contractual term. The SARs vest over a period of   three years   and have a contractual term of   five years  . The liability related to these awards is included in other long-term liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Share-based compensation expense for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   2015   was   $(8,000)   and   $(1.2) million  , respectively. As of   March 31, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation was   $36,000  , which is expected to be recognized over a   three  -year period. 
    
  On May 22, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors approved the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2015 Stock Plan ), which was subsequently approved by the Company s stockholders on June 23, 2015. The   2015   Stock Plan allows for the issuance of up to   1,500,000   shares of common stock to be granted through incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other stock-based awards to officers, other employees, directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. The exercise price of stock options under the   2015   Stock Plan is determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, and may be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date the option is granted. The total number of shares of stock with respect to which stock options and stock appreciation rights may be granted to any one employee of the Company or a subsidiary during any   one  -year period under the   2015   plan shall not exceed   500,000  . Options become exercisable over various periods from the date of grant, and generally expire   10   years after the grant date. As of   March 31, 2016  , there were approximately   1,260,000   options issued and outstanding under the   2015   Stock Plan. 
    
  On June 23, 2015,   50,000   options were granted to each of   two   executive officers of the Company. These options were issued at an exercise price of   $1.23  , vesting in equal quarterly installments over   three   years beginning July 1, 2015. In accordance with ASC 718, these options are recognized as equity and expensed over the vesting period of three years.  
    
  On July 30, 2015, the Company entered into separate consulting agreements with   two   individuals pursuant to which each would provide certain business and financial advisory services to the Company. In connection with the consulting agreements, each consultant was granted options exercisable for   500,000   shares of the Company s common stock, par value   $0.0001   per share under the Company s   2015   Stock Incentive Plan (for an aggregate of   1,000,000   shares). The options had an exercise price of   $1.27  , would have expired on July 30, 2020, and were fully vested on the date of the grant. On January 6, 2016, the options of these individuals were revoked as the contracts were terminated for cause, pursuant to the stock option agreements. 
    
  On February 17, 2016, certain executive officers of the Company were granted options to purchase a total of   130,000   shares of common stock, with an exercise price   $1.04  , and vesting on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The total fair value of the options was   $125,000   and is being amortized over the vesting period. 
    
  On March 25, 2016, certain executive officers and employees of the Company were granted options to purchase   1,030,000   shares of common stock, with an exercise price of   $1.12  , and vesting as to 25% of the grant on the two, three, four and five-year anniversary of the date of the grant. The total fair value of the options was   $611,000   and is being amortized over the vesting period. 
  
   25 

The fair value of all options totaled approximately   $852,000   (  $0.68   per share) on   March 31, 2016   compared to the fair value of   $1.2 million   (  $1.08   per share) on   December 31, 2015  . The share-based compensation expense for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   was   $5,000  . As of   March 31, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation was   $832,000  , which is expected to be recognized over a   three  -year period.  
    
  The Company determines the expense related to the SARs, employee stock options and warrants under the guidance of ASC 718, and estimates the fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model.  For non-employee awards, the awards are accounted for under the guidance of ASC 505-50, with fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. 
    
  The grant date fair value of each option award and warrant is calculated using a Black-Scholes valuation model, which incorporates the following weighted average assumptions: 

The following table summarizes stock option activity: 

(15)   Stockholders' Equity and Non-controlling Interest 
    
  Public Offering 
    
  On March 4, 2015 the Company raised proceeds of   $20 million   though the sale of   6,667,000   shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of   6,667,000   shares of its common stock at a combined offering price of   $3.00   in an underwritten public offering ( Offering ). The warrants have a per share exercise price of   $3.75  , are exercisable immediately and will expire   five   years from the date of issuance. The Company granted the underwriters a   45  -day option to purchase up to an additional   1,000,050   shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of   1,000,050   shares of common stock to cover additional over-allotments, if any. On March 4, 2015, the underwriters exercised a portion of their over-allotment option with respect to   113,200   warrants. In addition,   166,675   warrants were issued to the underwriters. The over-allotment option has expired as of the date of this filing. 

26 

The gross proceeds to the Company, including the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option, were approximately   $20 million   before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The net proceeds from the Offering were approximately   $17.8 million  . Assuming the exercise of all   6,667,000   warrants at the exercise price of   $3.75   each, and assuming the Company maintains the conditions necessary for a cash exercise, the total additional gross aggregate proceeds to the Company would be approximately   $25 million  . However, there can be no assurance that any warrants will be exercised or that the Company will maintain conditions necessary for a cash exercise. 
    
  The exercise price of the warrants are subject to anti-dilutive adjustments (such as stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or other similar events). There are no cash settlement alternatives associated with the warrant agreements that would require the Company to pay a holder of such warrant cash at exercise or at any other event. The fair value of the warrants is approximately   $9.0 million   as calculated using the Black Scholes model. In accordance with GAAP, the Company has accounted for the warrants as equity instruments. 
    
  The Warrants will be exercisable at any time a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants under the Securities Act is effective and available for the issuance of such shares, or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act is available for the issuance of such shares, by payment in full in immediately available funds for the number of shares of Common Stock purchased upon such exercise. If a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants under the Securities Act is not effective or available and an exemption from registration under the Securities Act is not available for the issuance of such shares, the holder may, in its sole discretion, elect to exercise the Warrant through a cashless exercise, in which case the holder would receive upon such exercise the net number of shares of Common Stock determined according to the formula set forth in the Warrant. The Company currently does not have a registration statement available that registers the common stock underlying the warrants. 
    
  A holder of Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of the Warrant if such exercise would result in the holder (together with its affiliates) beneficially owning in excess of   4.99%   of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, unless the holder provides at least   61   days' prior notice to the company. In no event may the Warrant holder's ownership exceed   9.99%    
    
  At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement 
    
  On December 3, 2014, the Company entered into an  At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement  with MLV   Co. LLC ( MLV ) pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to   $25,000,000   from time to time through MLV, acting as agent. Sale of shares under this agreement were sold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-200712), which became effective on January 15, 2015. During   three months ended March 31, 2015  , the Company sold   101,083   shares under the agreement and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately   $684,000  .   No   shares were sold during the   three months ended March 31, 2016  . The Company is no longer eligible to sell stock under the At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement and will not be eligible to do so until our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 is available for use. 
    
  Possible Issuance of Additional Common Stock under Share Exchange Agreement 
    
  Rochon Capital is controlled by John P. Rochon and beneficially owns approximately   40%   of the Company's outstanding common stock. 
    
  Under a certain Share Exchange Agreement with Rochon Capital, which was amended during the fourth quarter of 2014 (the "Amended Share Exchange Agreement") Rochon Capital has rights to be issued the   25,240,676   shares of our common stock (the "Second Tranche Parent Stock") upon the public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has become an Acquiring Person (as defined below), or upon the commencement or announcement of a tender or exchange offer which would result in any person or group becoming an Acquiring Person. In such event, the Second Tranche Parent Stock will be issued to Rochon Capital, or a Permitted Transferee to whom the right has been transferred, within ten (  10  ) days of its written request, which request shall be in its sole discretion. A person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an "Acquiring Person," thus triggering the issuance of the Second Tranche Parent Stock to Rochon Capital, or a Permitted Transferee to whom the right has been transferred, upon acquiring, subsequent to the date of the Amended Share Exchange Agreement, beneficial ownership of   15%   or more of the shares of our common stock then outstanding. The term "Acquiring Person" shall not include (1) any person who acquires  15%   or more of our shares of common stock in a transaction approved by John P. Rochon, (2) any affiliates of John P. Rochon or (3) any family members of John P. Rochon. 

27 

Other Outstanding Warrants 
    
  On July 30, 2015, the Company executed an extension on a consulting agreement through July of 2017 in exchange for the issuance of warrants exercisable for   50,000   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of   $1.16   per share. The warrant is also exercisable for a   ten   (10) day period commencing   720   days after issuance. An expense of   $3,000   and   $0   has been recognized for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCI") is comprised of the following (in thousands): 

(16)   Loss Per Share Attributable to JRJR 
    
  Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities are not included in the computation of dilutive loss per common share because we have experienced operating losses in all periods presented and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive.  
    
  The potentially dilutive securities that are excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation are summarized as follows (additional shares subject to issuance):  

(17)   Segment Information 
    
  The Company operates   four   operating segments,   three   of which are reportable segments, as a direct selling company that sells a wide range of products sold primarily by independent sales force members across many countries around the world. For the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015  , respectively, approximately   $28.2 million   or   78.1%   and   $9.1 million   or   45.9%   of our revenues were generated in international markets.  

28 

The Company has grouped our products into the following   four   operating segments: gourmet food, nutritional and wellness, home d cor and other. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S. Of these   four   operating segments, gourmet food, home d cor, and nutritional and wellness qualify as reportable segments. 
    
  The Company has identified   three   reportable segments as each segment engages in business activities, incurring expenses and producing revenues. The operating results of these segments are regularly reviewed by chief operating decision makers ("CODMs") and there is discrete financial information available for each unit. Also, the reported revenue of each reportable segment, both external and intercompany, is   10%   or more of the combined revenue of all of the operating segments. 
    
  Gourmet Food   - Segment consists of operations related to the production and sale of hand-crafted spices, oils and other food products from around the world. These operations have a presence in many of our markets both in the U.S. and internationally such as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The subsidiaries involved in this line of business are Your Inspiration at Home and My Secret Kitchen. 
    
  Home D cor   - Segment consists of operations related to the production and sale of premium hand-crafted baskets and the selling of products for the home, including pottery, cleaning, health, beauty, outdoor and customizable vinyl expressions for display. These operations are primarily located within the United States and the United Kingdom. The primary subsidiaries involved in this line of business are Kleeneze, Betterware, TLC and Uppercase Living. 
    
  Nutritional and Wellness   - Segment consists of operations related to the selling of nutritional supplements and skin care products. These operations have a presence in many foreign markets and over   50   countries such as Italy, Russia, Spain, and Thailand. The subsidiary primarily involved in this type of products is Agel. 
    
  The Company notes that these three segments exceed   75.0%   of the Company's consolidated revenue. Therefore, no further aggregation or disclosures are required for the remaining operating segments. 
    
  The Company has included an "other" within the tables below consisting of HCG, Paperly, and Tomboy Tools to provide easier reconciliation to our results found on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and further transparency. 
    
  In the tables below the Company presents revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and other expenses by operating segment. When evaluating performance, our chief operating decision makers look at each segments gross profit to evaluate profitability. The CODMs view our operating expenses as holistic due to many shared expenses that occur at the corporate level. These shared expenses occur when corporate provides services to our operating segments, which is consistent with our post-acquisition integration strategies. None of the reportable segments cross sell to other reportable segments.

(18)   Subsequent Events 
    
  On April 14, 2016, the Company notified the NYSE MKT LLC (the  Exchange ) that it did not expect to timely file its 2015 Form 10-K with the SEC. On April 19, 2016, the Company issued a press release announcing that it received a letter from the Exchange on April 15, 2016 notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual as a result of its failure to timely file its 2015 Form 10-K with the SEC. The Company submitted a plan to the Exchange on May 16, 2016 advising of actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with the continued listed standards by October 17, 2016. The letter from the Exchange also notes that the Exchange may nevertheless commence delisting proceedings at any time if it deems that the circumstances warrant such proceedings.

On May 23, 2016, the Company received a letter from the Exchange notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual as a result of its failure to timely file its March Form10-Q with the SEC.  The Company was advised that in order to maintain its listing on the Exchange, the Company was required to submit to the Exchange a plan detailing action it had taken, or would take, that would bring it into compliance with the continued listing standards by October 17, 2016 (the  Plan Period ). 
    
  On July 8, 2016, the Company received a letter from the Exchange stating that the Exchange had accepted the Company s plan of compliance (the  Plan ) for continued listing relating to the Company s failure to timely file its March Form 10-Q. On July 8, 2016, the Exchange notified the Company that it has until October 17, 2016 to regain compliance with the continued listing standards of the Company Guide. The Company will be subject to periodic review by the Exchange during the Plan Period. Failure to make progress consistent with the Plan or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards of the Company Guide by the end of the Plan Period could result in the Company being delisted from the Exchange. The Company is working diligently to regain compliance with the Company Guide by October 17, 2016. 
    
  On August 23, 2016, the Company received a letter from the Exchange stating that the Company did not timely file with the SEC its June Form 10-Q by its requisite deadline. As such, the Company remains non-compliant with Sections 134 and 1101 of the Company Guide. 
    
  As a result of the foregoing, the Company has again become subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide. Due to the similar nature of the two deficiencies (i.e., the failure to timely file the March Form 10-Q and the June Form 10-Q), the Company is not required to submit an additional plan of compliance in connection with the failure to timely file the June Form 10-Q. However, the Company may elect to supplement the Plan if it chooses. The Plan Period to address how the Company intends to regain compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the Company Guide remains October 17, 2016 for both deficiencies. The Company will be subject to periodic review by the Exchange during the Plan Period.  
    
  The Company remains subject to the conditions set forth in the NYSE letter dated May 23, 2016. Failure to make progress consistent with the Plan or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards of the Company Guide by the end of the Plan Period could result in the Company being delisted from the NYSE. On October 7, 2016, the Company requested an additional extension until November 30, 2016 to file the June Form 10-Q. The Company has not received a response as of the date of this filing.  
    
  On September 15, 2016, the Company's stockholders, at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approved an amendment to the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock that the Company will have authority to grant under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan from   1,500,000   to   3,000,000  .

Management Overview 
    
  The Company is a global platform of multiple direct-to-consumer brands, a place where independent sales representatives in markets around the world can pursue earning opportunities at their own pace, using company-provided IT systems, including back office tools and "business in a box," with e-commerce tools to enhance their ability to serve customers.  
    
  The Company has one  product" for our sales force members, a business opportunity. They earn income for their families and have the freedom to decide for themselves how much time and effort to put into their business. Our platform of multiple brands supports that opportunity. The Company does not consider our strategy to be a  roll-up.  Each of our companies keeps its own distinct brand identity, its own sales force, its own compensation plan and its own product line. Behind the scenes, in operational areas such as finance, accounting, treasury, technology and supply chain, the Company finds synergies and achieve efficiencies by eliminating duplication of efforts and costs. 
    
  The Company places particular emphasis on serving and supporting the independent sales forces of our companies. The Company is keenly aware that our ultimate success is based upon the energy and activity of our companies  sales forces. Therefore, the Company focuses on giving them the leadership, motivation, support, tools, incentives and encouragement that they need to grow their own businesses, benefit their families and achieve their dreams. The Company works to enhance the performance of the companies acquired and to help each of them achieve positive free cash flow. 
    
  The Company's portfolio contains ten companies, with the last acquisition being Betterware in the fourth quarter of 2015. With each acquisition, the Company has expanded our product base and our base of independent sales representatives and potential customers. This convergence of personal relationships, social media and relationship-based commerce is what we believe gives the Company our unique blend of attributes for growth. As the Company scales up through additional acquisitions and organic growth, the Company expects that these attributes will be amplified. This sector has unique characteristics which are quite unlike those of the traditional retail sector. Companies in this sector must be managed accordingly, by persons who understand this channel s uniqueness. 
    
  On a consolidated basis, the operating companies within the Company continue to improve performance, particularly when one considers that many of them were troubled or under-performing turnarounds when the Company acquired them. Taking an under-performing company, identifying unnecessary costs, integrating its operations, identifying weaknesses and effecting a turnaround obviously requires time to accomplish. We believe the Company has made very satisfactory progress in these turnaround tasks, recognizing that each JRJR company brings its own unique needs, strengths, weaknesses and opportunities. That is why the JRJR story is an   ongoing   story of finding efficiencies, reducing costs, spotting opportunities for top line growth, creating increasing predictability of revenue and reducing risk over time through portfolio diversification.

Overview of Operating Segments 
    
  The Company has   four   operating segments, three of which are reportable segments, as a direct-to-consumer company that sells a wide range of products primarily through independent sales forces across many countries around the world. The Company has grouped our products into the following   four   operating segments: gourmet food; home d cor; nutritional and wellness; and other. Of these   four   operating segments, gourmet food, home d cor, and nutritional and wellness qualify as reportable segments. Our long-lived assets are concentrated in the United States, even after the acquisitions of Kleeneze and Betterware. 
    
  Each of the three identified reportable segments engage in business activities - producing revenue and incurring expenses. The operating results of these segments are regularly reviewed by chief decision makers and there is discrete financial information available for each unit. Also, the reported revenue of each reportable segment, both external and intercompany, is 10% or more of the combined revenue of all of the operating segments. In prior periods the Company had identified and presented one reportable segment, with revenue broken down into   four   categories within our segment discussion. However, with the addition of Kleeneze and Betterware, the continued growth of Your Inspiration at Home and anticipated future growth, both organically and through acquisitions, we now view the Company as having   four   operating segments, three of which are reportable segments as discussed above. As revenues are concentrated within these three reportable segments, our chief operating decision makers now view these segments as appropriate for decision making purposes because they each represent a significant part of our business. The following is a brief description of our three reportable segments. 
    
  Gourmet Food   - Segment consists of operations related to the production and sale of hand-crafted spices, oils and other food products from around the world. These operations have a presence in many of our markets both in the U.S. and internationally such as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The company subsidiaries involved in this line of business are Your Inspiration at Home and My Secret Kitchen. 
    
  Home D cor   - Segment consists of operations related to the production and sale of premium hand-crafted baskets and the selling of products for the home, including pottery, cleaning, health, beauty, home, outdoor and customizable vinyl expressions for display. These operations are primarily located within the United States and the United Kingdom. The primary subsidiaries involved in this line of business are Kleeneze, Betterware, TLC and Uppercase Living. 
    
  Nutritional and Wellness   - Segment consists of operations related to the selling of nutritional supplements and skin care products. These operations have a presence in many foreign markets and over 50 countries such as Italy, Russia, Spain, and Israel. The subsidiary primarily involved in this type of products is Agel. 
    
  The Company notes that these three segments exceed 75% of the Company's consolidated revenue. Therefore, no further aggregation or disclosures are required for the remaining operating segments. 

Results of Operations 
    
  Revenue (in thousands): 

Total revenue for   2016   increased by   $16.2 million  , or approximately   81%   compared with   2015  , primarily due to the prior year acquisitions of Kleeneze and Betterware.  

33 

Gourmet Food 

The gourmet food segment's revenue increased by   $382,000  , or   15%   for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   compared to the   three months ended March 31, 2015  . The increase in revenue was primarily driven by the growth in Canada and New Zealand; Your Inspiration at Home expanded into both markets in 2015. 
       
  Home D cor 

The home d cor segment's revenue increased by   $16.5 million  , or   162%   for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   compared to the prior year. Kleeneze and Betterware, both acquired in 2015, attributed to a revenue increase of $19.0 million compared to the prior year. The revenue at Longaberger declined $2.4 million, or 27% compared to the prior year. Longabeger's revenue has been declining since 2000 when it recorded revenue of over $1.0 billion. Over the years, Longaberger has tried to change its compensation plan and product categories to no avail. The Company believes that an aging sales force and a saturated market are currently the primary reasons for the decline. 
       
  Nutritional and Wellness 

The nutritional and wellness segment's revenue decreased by   $511,000  , or   8%   compared to the   three months ended March 31, 2015  . The decline is primarily driven by the negative impacts of foreign exchange in Agel s key markets. Agel s most collected currency, the Euro, depreciated 2% compared to the USD from   March 31, 2015   to   March 31, 2016  . In addition to a depreciating Euro, the Ruble in Russia, another key market, depreciated by 16% from   March 31, 2015   to   March 31, 2016  . The damaging effects of the appreciating USD was partially offset by the $217,000 revenue increase in Thailand.  
       
  Geographic Revenue 

For the quarter ended   March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015  , respectively, approximately   $28.2 million   or   78.1%   and   $9.1 million   or   45.9%   of our revenues were generated in international markets. The gourmet food and home d cor were the segments that contributed most to the increase of revenue generated in international markets compared to the prior year. 
       
  Gross profit (in thousands): 

During the   three months ended March 31, 2016  , gross profit increased by   $7.6 million  , or   63%   compared to the   three months ended March 31, 2015  . For the quarter ended   March 31, 2016  , gross profit margins decreased to   55%   from the quarter ended   March 31, 2015   percentage of   61%  . 
    
  Gourmet Food 

Home D cor 

The home d cor segment's gross profit improved by   $7.8 million  , or   147%   for the quarter ended   March 31, 2016   compared to the prior year mostly due to the acquisition of Kleeneze and Betterware. Due to the new acquisitions having lower gross profit margins, the gross profit margin for the home d cor segment fell to   49%   compared to   52%   the prior year. 

34 

Nutritional and Wellness 

Operating expenditures (in thousands): 

For the quarter ended   March 31, 2016   operating expenditures   increased   by   $10.2 million  , or   63%   compared to the prior year.     The operating loss   worsened   by   $2.6 million   for the quarter ended   March 31, 2016   compared to the prior year.  
    
  Gourmet Food 

The gourmet food segment's operating expenditures increased by   $300,000  , or   16%   compared to the prior year. Over the last year, the business had to be scaled with the revenue resulting in higher operating expenditures. In addition, the sales field earned more in commissions due to the products sold having a higher mark up as a result of less product discounting. 
       
  Home D cor 

The home d cor segment's operating expenditures increased by   $10.0 million  , or   154%   compared to the prior year in large part due to the acquisitions of Kleeneze and Betterware. $11.0 million of the increase is attributable to the acquisitions. The increase in operating expenditures is partially offset by the decrease of expenditures at Longaberger of approximately $830,000 related to cost reduction initiatives such as reducing payroll and general operating expenditures. 
       
  Nutritional and Wellness 

The nutritional and wellness segment's operating expenditures increased by   $227,000  , or   4%   compared to the prior year. The commissions, selling, and general and administrative expenses increased by $62,000 compared to the prior year. Non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, resulted in a $166,000 increase in operating expenses compared to the prior year.  
       
  Other Income and Expenses 
    
  Gain/loss on sale of marketable securities 
    
  At   March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015  , the fair value of the fixed income securities totaled approximately   $3.0 million   and   $5.3 million  , respectively. Our realized gains from the sale of our marketable securities totaled   $3,000   for the quarter ended   March 31, 2016  . The realized gain from the sale of marketable securities totaled   $192,000   for the quarter ended   March 31, 2015  . These securities are Level 1 securities estimated based on quoted prices in active markets. 
    
  Interest expense, net 
    
  For the quarter ended   March 31, 2016  , interest expense increased by $  233,000   compared with   2015  , as the combined result of debt issued and assumed in connection with the Betterware and Kleeneze acquisitions, and the issuance of convertible debt during   2015  . 

35 

Income tax provision 
    
  For the quarter ended   March 31, 2016   the income tax provision of   $77,000   decreased by   $114,000   compared with the   2015   income tax provision of   $191,000  . The Company has taxable income due to the Company having significant taxable income in connection with its foreign operations. 
    
  Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest 
    
  Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest was $  963,000   and $  670,000   for the quarters ended   March 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase is a result of TLC having a larger loss in the first quarter of   2016   compared to the comparable prior year quarter. 
    
  Additional Performance Indicators - EBITDA Metrics 
    
  The Company believes that having a reliable measure of our financial health is invaluable both to us and to potential business partners. The Company believes that Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA ), and Adjusted EBITDA can be useful performance indicators over time. 
    
  The Company has included EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because they are key metrics used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends in our business. In particular, the exclusion of certain specific expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis. The CODMs believe this metric is particularly useful for determining the performance of our subsidiary business and ongoing corporate expenses absent costs associated with the ongoing acquisition component of our strategy. 
    
  These measures are not defined by GAAP and the discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to conflict with or change any of the GAAP disclosures described above. Management considers these measures in addition to operating income to be important to estimate the enterprise and stockholder values of the Company, and for making strategic and operating decisions. In addition, analysts, investors and creditors use these measures when analyzing our operating performance, financial condition and cash generating ability. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be construed as a substitute for net income (loss) (as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance of financial position, as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined by GAAP. 
    
  Our use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments such as debt or capital lease payments. 
                
    EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
                
    EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation; 
                
    Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs; and 
                
    Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
       
  Because of these limitations, you should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results. 
    
  Additional Adjusted EBITDA Adjustments 
    
  Capital Market Expenses 
    
  Capital market expenses would include the cost of having a printer, stock transfer agent, specific SOX compliance costs, investor relation costs, as well as any listing or other exchange fees, specific equity offering expenses such as road show fees, security and regulatory adviser retainer and work fees, and fees associated with filings in a given period. Capital market expenses don't include auditor fees in connection to the filings, tax advising fees, board advising fees, or D O insurance carrier charges.  

36 

M A Expenses 
    
  M A expenses include specific M A expenses such as M A adviser work fees, due diligence costs, M A retainer fees, engagement fees, finder fees, travel costs related to a potential acquisition, a gain on acquisition, and any other deal related expenses.  
    
  M A Infrastructure Expense 
    
  These are expenses related to our M A infrastructure, such as our M A team and costs associated with supporting their efforts, as well as expenses related to our Reimbursement of Services Agreement with Richmont Holdings. The Company expects these costs to continue as opportunistic acquisition targets are sought and participation in other deal-related activities continue. 
    
  Other EBITDA Adjustments 
    
  Other EBITDA adjustments include stock compensation expenses, non-cash compensation, deferred rent, inventory write-off adjustments, gains/losses in relation to the sale of an asset, asset impairment costs such as goodwill impairment, asset fair value adjustments, and debt forgiveness expenses. The CODMs believe that these expenses should be included as an EBITDA adjustment as they are typically non-cash adjustments.

The following table presents a reconciliation of Earnings (loss) before income tax provision to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of each of the segment for the quarter ended   March 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

During the   three months ended March 31, 2016  , EBITDA     (losses) increased by   $2.4 million  , or   68%   compared to the   three months ended March 31, 2015  . For the quarter ended   March 31, 2016  , Adjusted EBITDA (losses) increased   42%   to   $1.4 million   compared to the quarter ended   March 31, 2015  . 
    
  Gourmet Food 

Home D cor 

For the   three months ended March 31, 2016  , the home d cor segment's EBITDA (losses)   increased     $2.5 million   to   $(2.8) million  , compared to the prior year. The worsening of the EBITDA (losses) was a result of the decrease of earnings described above as well as the decrease in depreciation and amortization of   $256,000   compared to the   three months ended March 31, 2015  . The decrease in depreciation and amortization was offset by an increase in interest expense of   $378,000   compared to the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA (losses)   increased   to   $(2.6) million   for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   from   $(630,000)   for the   three months ended March 31, 2015  . The M A expenses that occured as a result of a service level agreement with the prior owners of Kleeneze increased in   three months ended March 31, 2016   compared to the same period the prior year. The increase in M A expenses combined with the increase in non-cash stock compensation has resulted in Adjusted EBITDA (losses) adjustments increasing   $537,000   compared to the same period in the prior year. 
       
  Nutritional and Wellness 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  During   2015  , our condensed consolidated balance sheet was impacted most significantly by the acquisitions of Kleeneze and Betterware, a public stock offering, and the issuance of convertible debt. 

38 

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash generated from sales, and debt and equity issuances. Until the Company is current on all of its public filings, the Company will be limited in its ability to raise money through the capital markets. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in short-duration fixed income mutual funds, which may include investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were   $6.2 million   as of   March 31, 2016  , a   decrease   of   $5.6 million   from   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to paying down accounts payable balances at TLC and other uses of cash for operating expenses. 
    
  The Company also continues the disposal of buildings and land that are not used by our operating companies or core to our go-forward business strategy. Land and building sales of this kind in   2016   totaled in excess of   $68,000  , which was a contribution of cash to ongoing working capital needs. While the majority of our excess buildings and land has been sold, the Company believes there is still an opportunity to generate incremental cash from future disposals of this kind.  
    
  Currently the Company does not have a revolving credit facility or other working capital facility. Although we believe the Company will generate sufficient cash flows, in conjunction with our marketable securities on hand, to fund our business currently, we recognize that there may be additional needs for working capital as we invest in the Company's current businesses and as the Company looks for accretive future acquisitions. The Company is constantly evaluating the most efficient capital available for these purposes. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Cash   Used in   Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash   used in   operating activities for the   three months ended March 31, 2016     increased   to   $5.2 million  , as compared to net cash   used in   operating activities of   $3.7 million   for the   three months ended March 31, 2015  . Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net loss of   $(7.7) million   for non-cash items of   $2.1 million   and changes in working capital of   $362,000  . The changes in working capital were primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities.  
    
  Cash   Provided by   Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash   provided from   investing activities for the   three months ended March 31, 2016     increased   by   $17.5 million   to   $2.4 million  , as compared to a net cash   used in   investing activities of   $15.1 million   for the   three months ended March 31, 2015  .  
    
  For the   three months ended March 31, 2016   the Company   generated proceeds of     $2.3 million   from the net   sale   of marketable securities compared to proceeds of   $8.7 million   from the net   purchase   of marketable securities during the   three months ended March 31, 2015  . For the   three months ended March 31, 2015  , the Company used cash of   $3.0 million   as collateral on a loan and   $3.1 million   for acquisitions. 
    
  Cash   Used in   Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash   used in   financing activities for the   three months ended March 31, 2016     decreased   by   $21.5 million   to   $362,000   for the   three months ended March 31, 2016  , compared to the net cash   provided from   financing activities of   $21.1 million   for the   three months ended March 31, 2015  . 
    
  During the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015  , the Company made payments of   $425,000   and   $247,000  , respectively, on principal payments of debt. During the   three months ended March 31, 2015  , the Company borrowed   $3.0 million   to use as proceeds for the acquisition of Kleeneze. Through the issuance of common stock and warrants in a public offering consummated in March 2015, the Company raised net proceeds of approximately $18.4 million. For the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2015  , the company raised net proceeds of   $63,000   and   $18.4 million  .

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  In preparing our condensed financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the Company makes assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net income (loss) and affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. The Company bases the assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates the used assumptions, judgments and estimates. The Company also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Company believes that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations, income taxes, and long-lived assets, have the greatest impact on the Companies condensed financial statements, so the Company considers these to be critical accounting policies. Historically, the Company's assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. 
    
  Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the condensed financial statements apply to the following critical accounting policies: 
    
  Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue 
    
  The Company receives payment, primarily via credit card, for the sale of products at the time customers place orders. Sales and related fees such as shipping and handling, net of applicable sales discounts, are recorded as revenue when the product is shipped and when title and the risk of ownership passes to the customer. Payments received for undelivered products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities. Certain incentives offered on the sale of our products, including sales discounts, are classified as a reduction of revenue. A provision for product returns and allowances is recorded and is based on historical experience. 
    
  Business Combinations 
    
  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as of the acquisition date, which is the date on which control of the acquired company is transferred to the Company. Control is assessed by considering the legal transfer of voting rights that are currently exercisable and managerial control of the entity. Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, related to a business combination are expensed as incurred. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company and our U.S. subsidiaries excluding TLC file a consolidated Federal income tax return. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between accrual basis and tax bases of asset and liabilities. The principal differences are described in   Note (10)  , Income Taxes, to our condensed financial statements included in this report. Benefits from tax credits are reflected currently in earnings. The Company records income tax positions based on a more likely than not threshold that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities having full knowledge of all relevant information. Our international operations are generally taxed based on local pretax profits for the individual subsidiaries, without offset for pretax losses of other subsidiaries. The Company permanently reinvests earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. 
    
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangibles with definite lives for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of such an asset might not be recoverable. When indicators are present, management determines whether there has been an impairment of long-lived assets held for use in the business by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying value of the asset. The amount of any resulting impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value. Long-lived assets that meet the definition of held for sale, when present, are valued at the lower of carrying amount or net realizable value. Assets or asset groups are determined at the lowest level possible for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For assets whose aggregate undiscounted cash flows are  
  
   40 

less than its carrying value, the assets are considered potentially impaired and actual impairments, if any, would be determined to the extent the assets' carrying value exceeds its aggregate fair value. 
    
  Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
    
  The Company performs our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible impairment test annually or when changes in circumstances indicate an impairment event may have occurred by estimating the fair value of each reporting unit compared to its carrying value. Our reporting units represent an operating segment or a reporting level below an operating segment. 
    
  Additionally, the reporting units are aggregated based on similar economic characteristics, nature of products and services, nature of production processes, type of customers and distribution methods. The Company uses a market approach to calculate the fair value of goodwill for reporting units and a discounted cash flow approach to calculate the fair value of other intangible assets. The models includes a number of significant assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and these estimates could be materially impacted by adverse changes in market conditions. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  See   Note (2)  , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our unaudited condensed financial statements included in this report. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company is occasionally involved in lawsuits and disputes arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon advice of counsel, the likelihood of an adverse outcome against the Company is not subject to reasonable estimation. However, management believes that the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. 

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Because the Company is a smaller reporting company, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
  
   41 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls were not effective because of the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting described below. 
    
  Management has identified material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting relating to the following: 

Overall Control Environment 
     The Company has not maintained an effective control environment to provide reasonable assurance regarding achievement of relating to operations, reporting and compliance. The Company has not complied with the requirement of the 2013 COSO Framework. 

Sufficient Accounting Personnel 
     The Company has not maintained sufficient accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training commensurate with maintaining an effective control environment to meet the financial reporting requirements of a publicly traded company with international operations. The result of the lack of sufficient accounting personnel has led to the following issues related to internal control over financial reporting: 
             
    Management estimates were not performed with the structure and rigor necessary to result in quality estimate that need for fairly presented financial information. 
                
    Management missed a required Form 8-K/A filing requirement related to the acquisition of Kleeneze. Subsequently, the filing was made 8 months later.  
                
    Management has made significant adjustments for material errors resulting from the review of the quarterly financial statements. 
                
    Management has made significant adjustments for material errors resulting from the audit of the annual financial statements.  
                
    Management has made significant disclosure remediation and adjustments to the financial statements resulting from the quarterly review and annual audits.  
                
    The Company has incurred substantial delays in completing its audit and filing with the SEC of its 2015 Form 10-K, this Quarterly Report, and its June Form 10-Q. 
                
    The Company has incurred breaches to covenants to its debt agreements due to the delays in missing its filing requirements.  

Consolidation Process 
     The Company does not have effective controls to ensure the consolidation of all its subsidiaries is performed correctly. The consolidation is performed and reviewed by one employee. There are no controls to ensure all financial data of the subsidiaries are being compiled correctly, no review to ensure the employee is consolidating correctly and no controls to ensure all accounts being appropriately converted and consolidated in the financial statements.  

Account Reconciliation 
     The Company did not maintain effective controls over the reconciliation of many of its accounts and the timely preparation and review of the financial statements or information. This has resulted in a significant amount of reconciliations being performed as part of the audit process. These reconciliations have resulted in significant audit adjustments. Additionally, there is no formal review and approval of reconciliations performed by the accounting personnel.  

Deferred Revenue and Revenue 
     The Company did not maintain control over its recording of deferred revenue and revenue in its sales process. This has resulted in significant adjustments to the financial statements.  

Inventory Management 
     Certain companies within the Company accepts its inventory upon the shipment of products (FOB Shipping Point). However, the Company does not account for the receipt of inventory until it has been received. Accordingly, the Company does not maintain appropriate controls around its inventory management system.  

42 

Journal Entry Support  
     The Company did not maintain effective controls over the approval, recording and retention of journal entries and their supporting detail. The Company did not maintain effective monitoring controls to ensure that journal entries were being properly prepared with sufficient supporting documentation or were reviewed and approved to ensure accuracy and completeness of the journal entries.  

Complex Accounting Issues 
     The Company did not design an effective control environment to address complex accounting issues. The lack of qualified accounting personnel led to deficiencies in identifying complex accounting issues and resulting in material adjustments to the financial statement in both the quarterly and year-end filings. 

Segregation of Duties 
     The Company has not maintained appropriate segregation of duties throughout the internal control over financial reporting process. The Company has numerous instances where review an approval is performed by the same employee negating any monitoring or approval controls.  

IT System Conversion Controls 
     The Company did not develop a process to appropriately control the ERP system conversion at one of its subsidiaries.  

IT Control Environment 
     The Company does not maintain the appropriate level of controls over the ability to access its ERP systems. The lack of control could result in the in inappropriate approval of journal entries, inappropriate approval of expenditures, and inappropriate access to the general ledger.  
    
  During the fiscal quarter ended   March 31, 2016  , there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Management s Remediation Initiatives 
    
  Management emphasizes that our stated growth strategy is to acquire companies. In some cases, the companies acquired may not have invested in adequate systems or staffing to meet public company financial reporting standards. The Company reviews the financial reporting and other systems that each company has and, in many cases, especially in the case of private companies, the financial systems that are in place may not be as robust as needed. In addition, the rapid pace of our acquisitions means the Company has acquired companies that currently operate on a variety of systems, which makes standardization more difficult. Because of this, the Company purchased and plan the implementation of a common enterprise resource planning system across all our companies. The Company believes this will allow for a common set of processes and controls to enable accurate financial information, easier comparison across companies and quicker consolidations. TLC, in February of 2015, was the first company to transition on to the new platform. 
    
  In addition, our objective is to centralize accounting and treasury, rather than having such activities performed at each subsidiary. This will provide a current and long-term benefit of having the required internal controls performed in a centralized controlled location, so that review and remediation can occur quickly. This effort means that the Company must continue to hire sufficient accounting personnel to properly process and control transactions and timely prepare our financial statements. 
    
  Finally, the Company seeks to build out a more traditional financial and accounting hierarchy which will be key to the centralization and streamlining of accounting and treasury functions. The Company expects to continue to improve on this goal and that when combined with the other initiatives, should result in a robust control environment in financial reporting, a financial reporting process that is capable of providing management with timely and accurate information and in-turn be able to comply timely with SEC filing requirements.  
    
  Limitations of the Effectiveness 
    
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors or all instances of fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide  
  
   43 

absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitation of a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  During 2014, Tamala L. Longaberger loaned a total of $1,000,000 to the Company, bearing interest at 10% and maturing in 2015. The Company determined to not service the loans related to Tamala L. Longaberger. In connection with these notes, Ms. Longaberger on August 12, 2015 filed an action in Franklin County Common Pleas Court of Columbus, Ohio ( State Court Action ) seeking re-payment of the notes.  However, the Company s position that her claims are inextricably tied to the broader issues related to her terminated employment and the claims asserted against her by the Company and The Longaberger Company, including breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence, conversion, misappropriation of company funds, civil theft, breach of contract, and misappropriation of trade secrets, in an arbitration action in Columbus Ohio.  As a result of her misconduct, the Company claims it is owed damages in amounts that exceed and therefore offset Ms. Longaberger s claims.  Therefore, on October 12, 2015, the Company filed a motion to compel arbitration and dismiss claims in the State Court Action.  On July 5, 2016, the Court overruled the Company s motion and on July 26, 2016, Ms. Longaberger filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings against AEI.  On August 9, 2016 the Company filed both a memorandum contra of Ms. Longaberger s motion on the pleadings and its first amended answer, affirmative defenses and counterclaims. On August 17, 2016, the Court eliminated the trial setting and further stated it will issue a new case schedule upon conclusion of the arbitration scheduled for December 2016.  On August 18, 2016 Ms. Longaberger withdrew her motion for judgment on the pleadings. 
    
  The Company has recorded a payable of   $560,000   related to an amended tax increment financing agreement that TLC entered into on April 3, 2007. Due to this liability not being disclosed during the due diligence, the Company has filed a complaint against the seller on September 22, 2016. This complaint may potentially result in the reimbursement of or the assumption of this liability by the seller. This contingent asset is not included on the balance sheet. 
    
  As first disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2014  , the Company is disputing a tax and penalty assessment by the Spanish Taxing Authorities relating to Agel. Prior to AEI s acquisition of the assets of Agel Enterprises LLC, Agel was assessed withholding taxes and income taxes along with penalties by the Spanish Tax Authorities, which asserted that Agel had maintained permanent establishment in Spain for the years 2008 to 2010. As part of the acquisition, AEI agreed to assume this liability. Agel, and now AEI, has vigorously disputed these claims on the basis that Agel believes they did not have permanent establishment, and therefore, any compensation paid to independent representatives should not have been subject to withholding taxes. 
    
  AEI filed an appeal in Tribunal Econ mico-Administrativo Regional de Catalu a. The ultimate resolution of the dispute cannot be determined at this time. Agel paid the income tax due and AEI has paid approximately $260,000 in good faith towards the disputed withholding tax liability to preserve the appeal process. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2014, AEI paid $420,000 to the Spanish Taxing Authorities toward its outstanding tax assessment. The Company did not make any payments in the third or fourth quarters of 2014. Although the Company has appealed this assessment by the Spanish Taxing Authorities and are rigorously defending our position, this payment was made to prevent the Spanish Taxing Authorities from beginning certain legal proceedings that would have negatively affected AEI s European operations. Additionally, AEI has been assessed amounts owed for late interest on the withholding and income tax of  10,819 and  1,282, respectively ($11,799 and $1,398, respectively). The amount remains due if the appeal is unsuccessful, otherwise the payments made to date will be refunded to us. As of   March 31, 2016   AEI maintained a liability of approximately $0.5 million in accrued liabilities for this disputed amount, which is reflected in our   2016   condensed financial statements. 
    
  From time to time the Company may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Other than the above, the Company is not aware of any material, active, pending or threatened proceeding against us, nor is the Company involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  
  
   44 

The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  contained in our 2015 Form 10-K. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
    
  Below, the Company is providing, in supplemental form, the material changes to our risk factors that occurred during the past quarter. Our risk factors disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of our Annual Report, on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended   March 31, 2016  , provide additional disclosure for these supplemental risks and are incorporated herein by reference. 
    
  We have suffered operating losses since inception and we may not be able to achieve profitability. 
    
  The Company had an accumulated deficit of   $(52.0) million   as of   March 31, 2016   and   $(45.3) million   as of   December 31, 2015  . Net losses attributable to JRjr33 totaled   $(6.8) million   for the   three months ended March 31, 2016   and   $(4.1) million   for the   three months ended March 31, 2015  . The Company expects to continue to incur increasing expenses in the foreseeable future related to our long-term growth strategy to develop a large, diverse global company in the micro-enterprise sector. As a result, the Company is sustaining operating and net losses, and it is possible that the Company will never be able to achieve or sustain the revenue levels necessary to attain profitability. 
    
  Our inability to file timely and accurate periodic reports may cause us to incur significant additional costs and may continue to affect our stock price. 
    
  As a public company, the Company is required to file annual and quarterly periodic reports containing our financial statements with the SEC within prescribed time periods. As part of the NYSE MKT stock exchange listing requirements, the Company is also required to provide our periodic reports, or make them available, to our stockholders within prescribed time periods. the Company has not been able to, and may continue to be unable to, produce timely financial statements or file these financial statements as part of a periodic report in a timely manner with the SEC or in compliance with the NYSE MKT stock exchange listing requirements. 
    
  Until the Company completes these remaining filings, the Company expects to continue to face many of the risks and challenges the Company has experienced during our extended filing delay period, including: 

continued concern on the part of customers, partners, investors, and employees about our financial condition and extended filing delay status, including potential loss of business opportunities; 
                
    additional significant time and expense required to complete our remaining filings and the process of maintaining the listing of our common stock on NYSE MKT beyond the significant time and expense the Company has already incurred in connection with our accounting review to date; 
                
    continued distraction of our senior management team and our board of directors as the Company works to complete our remaining filings; 
                
    limitations on our ability to raise capital and make acquisitions; and 
                
    general harm to reputation as a result of the foregoing. 
       
  The Company has been notified by the Exchange that our common stock listing on the Exchange could be suspended or terminated on or after October 17, 2016 if the Company has not filed all of our outstanding periodic reports with SEC by that date. On April 15, 2016, July 8, 2016 and August 23, 2016, the Company received notifications from the Exchange that our failure to timely file our 2015 Form 10-K, March Form 10-Q and June Form 10-Q resulted in us being subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide and the Company was advised that in order to maintain our listing on the Exchange, the Company was required to submit to the Exchange a plan detailing actions the Company has taken, or would take, that would bring us into compliance with the continued listing standards by October 17, 2016. 
    
  If our common stock listing on the Exchange is suspended or terminated, or if our stock is removed as a component of certain stock market indices, our stock price could materially suffer.  In addition, the Company or members of our management could be subject to investigation and sanction by the SEC and other regulatory authorities.  Any or all of the foregoing could also result in the commencement of stockholder lawsuits against us.  Any such litigation, as well as any proceedings that could in the future arise as a result of our filing delay and the circumstances which gave rise to it, may be time consuming and expensive, may divert management attention from the conduct of our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may expose us to costly indemnification obligations to current or former officers, directors, or other personnel, regardless of the outcome of such matter, which may not be adequately covered by insurance. 

45 

The failure to comply with the terms of our outstanding senior secured convertible notes could result in a default under the terms of the notes and, if uncured, it could potentially result in action against our pledged assets. 
    
  The Company issued $4,000,000 of senior secured convertible notes to an accredited investor in November 2015 that is secured by substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries.  The Company also issued convertible notes in the principal amount of  3,748,000 ($5,753,000 at the date of issuance) in connection with our October acquisition of Betterware. The $4,000,000 senior secured note matures on May 19, 2017 and the  3,748,000 in convertible notes issued mature in October 2018. The senior secured notes require us, among other things, to maintain the security interest, make monthly installment payments, and meet various negative and affirmative covenants. If the Company fails to comply with the terms of the senior secured convertible note and/or the related agreements, the senior note holder could declare a note default and if the default were to remain uncured, the secured creditor would have the right to proceed against any or all of the collateral securing their note. In addition, in the event the Company fails to comply with the terms of the  3,748,000 in convertible notes, the note holders also could declare a note default and if the default were to remain uncured, as a creditor they would have the right to proceed against our assets subject to the first priority of our secured creditors. Any action by our secured or unsecured creditors to proceed against our assets would likely have a serious disruptive effect on our business operations. 
    
  Our failure to timely file with the SEC the 2015 Form 10-K, the March Form 10-Q and the June Form 10-Q is an event of default under our senior secured note with Dominion. Dominion has agreed to waive each such event of default provided that the Company issues Dominion 50,000 shares of our common stock for each ten (10) business days that each filing is late. In addition, Dominion has provided a waiver such that the failure to comply with any other covenant set forth in Section 14 of the Note would not constitute an event of default under the Note, and that any further notice to Dominion under the Note in respect of the same would not be required; provided that the Company issues to Dominion 100,000 shares of its common stock; provided that such waiver shall not apply to any compliance failures that occur after January 1, 2017. The Company has cured our default with respect to the untimely filing of our 2015 Form 10-K and after the filing of this Quarterly Report, the Company will have cured our default with respect to the untimely filing of our March 31, 2016 Form 10-Q. If the Company should fail to issue the common stock to Dominion required beyond the date of filing of our June Form 10-Q as the waiver require, the loan would be in default and Dominion could call the Note making it immediately due and payable. To date, the Company has issued   950,000   shares of common stock to Dominion for such failure to timely file these reports with the SEC. 
    
  Our investments in marketable securities are subject to market risks, which may result in losses. 
    
  As of   March 31, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $3.0 million   and   $5.3 million   in marketable securities, respectively, invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of liquid bonds. At neither   March 31, 2016   nor   December 31, 2015   did the Company have any investments in equity securities. However, the Company has from time to time and may in the future invest in equity securities. During the   three months ended March 31, 2016  , the Company realized a gain on marketable securities of   $3,000  . These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 
    
  A majority of our directors are not "independent" and several of our directors and officers have other business interests. 
    
  As a  smaller reporting company  and "controlled company", the Company qualifies for certain exemptions to the Exchange listing requirements, including the requirement that a majority of our directors be independent. The slate of nominees elected to serve as directors at our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholder held on September 15, 2016 did not include a majority of directors who will be  independent  under the Exchange independence standards; however, all members of our audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committee are independent directors. This lack of  independence  may interfere with our directors  judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as directors 
    
  Several of our directors have other business interests, including Mr. Rochon, who controls Richmont Holdings. Those other interests may come into conflict with our interests and the interests of our shareholders. Mr. Rochon and several of our other directors serve on the boards of directors of several other companies and, as a result of their business experience, may be asked to serve on the boards of other companies. The Company may compete with these other business interests for such directors  time and efforts. 
    
  The Company's officers may also work for Richmont Holdings or its affiliated entities. These employees have discretion to decide what time they devote to our activities, which may result in a lack of availability when needed due to their other responsibilities. 
    
  We rely upon our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations to fund our business and if our cash flow from operations is inadequate, we will need to continue to raise capital through a debt or equity financing, if available, or curtail operations.  
  
   46 

The adequacy of our cash resources to continue to meet our future operational needs depends, in large part, on our ability to increase product sales and/or reduce operating costs. If we are unsuccessful in generating positive cash flow from operations, we could exhaust our available cash resources and be required to secure additional funding through a debt or equity financing. Any such additional funding may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. As a result, we may find it necessary to significantly scale back our operations and/or discontinue many of our activities, which could negatively affect our business and prospects. In addition, our failure to timely file this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, precludes us from being able to register our securities on a registration statement on Form S-3 for a one year period from the filing due date of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, which will make it more difficult and expensive for us to register our common stock and attract additional capital. Therefore, without S-3 eligibility it will be unlikely that any warrant holders from our recent offering will pay cash if they effectuate their exercise within the next year. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
