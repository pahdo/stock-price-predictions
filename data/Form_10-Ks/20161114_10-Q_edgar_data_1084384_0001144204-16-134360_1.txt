NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  

  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  UNAUDITED  

Note 1. Financial Condition   

As reflected in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, the Company reported net loss of ($20,175,322) for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and had
an accumulated deficit of ($275,810,853) as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company s financial statements through September 30,
2016 were materially impacted by a number of events: 

Divestiture of ValidSoft, on September 30, 2016, through a management buyout;   

Financing activity related to issuance of preferred shares and increase in note payable with its senior secured lender;   

the settlement with Cross River Investments ( CRI ) to issue 4.4 million common shares related
to the previous advance paid in relation to the planned divestiture of ValidSoft; and     

the restructuring of the Company.   

The substantial three phase restructuring plan (the  Plan ) was completed in the third quarter
2016. The Plan which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015 was designed to align actual expenses and investments with current
revenues as well as introduce new executive management. 

The first and second phase of the Plan
encompassed fourth quarter 2015 through second quarter 2016. The third and final phase of the Plan impacted third quarter 2016
results with $0.6 million in workforce reduction expenses primarily related to employee severances. Total workforce related restructuring
charges to-date is $2.7 million including non-cash charges of $0.7 million. 

The annualized savings in ongoing operating
expenses following the three phases of restructuring through the third quarter 2016 is approximately $10.0 million related to reduction
in full-time equivalent (FTE) headcount. At the end of third quarter 2016, FTE headcount was 82, down from 265 prior to the three
phase restructuring program and more sustainably aligned with current revenues. Included in the headcount reduction during the
first nine months of 2016 are 59 FTEs that resigned voluntarily. 

During the second and third phases of the
restructuring, in addition to its cost reduction initiatives, the Company took steps to broaden its revenue focus, pivoting towards
additional services including but not limited to recent complementary product initiatives. 

The reaffirmation by the Company s
largest customer, during the third quarter, underscores the quality of the Company s services and the expectation of adding
incremental subscribers. 

The Company suffered a liquidity crunch
during the third quarter and its senior lender provided an additional $1.2 million in funding. The maturity date for the loan was
changed to December 31, 2016 and a series of premiums were established as incentives to encourage the Company to pay off the outstanding
loan prior to December 31, 2016. 

The sale of ValidSoft at the end of the
third quarter for the price of $3.0 million was completed and the Company received $2.0 million in cash and a $1.0 million promissory
note. The $2.0 million in cash was used to pay down the senior secured loan. 

As part of the expired agreement with the prospective suitor
for ValidSoft, the Company received $700,000 in 2016, and during the third quarter the Company issued 4.4 million common shares
to CRI in full settlement. 

During the second quarter 2016, the Company
signed a non-binding definitive term sheets with prospective Lenders, which were expected to have resulted in an injection of immediate
working capital and establish a basis for raising additional capital in support of both its restructuring and new growth initiatives.
A series of delays beyond the control of the Company raised substantial doubt on whether this funding could be counted upon to
ease the financial stress on the Company and in cooperation with its senior lender these negotiations were terminated in the third
quarter. 

The current senior Lender, Atalaya, continues
to work with the Company to find solutions including but not limited to proposed issuances of new equity, warrant and option solicitations
and interim sources of capital. Until such new capital is secured and the senior Lender has been assured of satisfactory payoff,
the Company is primarily responsible to this debtholder. The Company s largest customer is fully aware of the critical need
to secure additional sources of capital and is working constructively in support of these initiatives. Effective August 15, 2016,
Atalaya has increased its loan to the Company by an additional $1.2 million. As a condition of the funding of the increase, the
largest customer has provided a comfort letter indicating its desire to increase its business with the Company. 

The cash balance of the Company at September
30, 2016 was $ 977,106. Additional capital is required during the fourth quarter 2016 to cover working capital deficiencies. The
incremental loan during the third quarter provided vital liquidity in the short term and the Company is pursuing additional capital. 

Although the Company has previously been
able to raise capital as needed, there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available at all, or if available, on
reasonable terms. Further, the terms of such financing may be dilutive to our existing stockholders or otherwise on terms not favorable
to us, or our existing stockholders. If we are unable to secure additional capital, and/or do not succeed in meeting our cash flow
objectives or the Lender takes steps to call the loan before new capital is attracted, the Company will be materially and negatively
impacted, and we may have to significantly reduce our operations. 

As of September 30, 2016, the completion
of the restructuring and divestiture of ValidSoft dramatically improve the pro forma operating results for the Company. However,
until the maturity date of the senior debt is extended and/or substantial new equity capital is secured, doubt remains concerning
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The additional $1.2 million of capital provided by Atalaya on August 15, 2016 is treated
as short-term bridge financing to help the Company complete an issuance of equity and/or divest assets.

Basis of Presentation of Interim Periods  

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Securities and
Exchange Commission, or SEC, Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. They do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with our
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in our 2015 Annual Report
on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016, referred to as our 2015 Annual Report. 

The interim condensed consolidated financial
statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion
of management, are necessary to present fairly our results of operations and financial position for the interim periods. The results
of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for future quarters or the full year. 

For a complete summary of our significant accounting
policies, please refer to Note 2,  Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  of our 2015 Annual Report.
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements conforms with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and requires management to make certain
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Significant areas
of estimates include revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, bad debt allowance, valuation of financial
instruments, useful lives of long lived assets and share-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit
Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   ( ASU 2016-13 ) which requires
measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the
Company s annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements; however at the current time
the Company does not know what impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements, financial condition or results
of operations. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ).
The updated guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the
accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement
of cash flows. The update to the standard is effective for the Company s annual and interim reporting periods beginning January
1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-09 on its consolidated financial
statements; however at the current time the Company does not know what impact the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated
financial statements, financial condition or results of operations. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus
Net).  This update provides clarifying guidance regarding the application of ASU 2014-09 when another party, along with
the reporting entity, is involved in providing a good or a service to a customer. In these circumstances, an entity is required
to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide that good or service to the customer (that is, the entity is a principal)
or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). In April
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,  which
clarifies the identification of performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-11,  Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging: Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards
Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 Emerging Issues Task Force Meeting ( EITF ), 
which rescinds SEC paragraphs pursuant to SEC staff announcements. These rescissions include changes to topics pertaining to accounting
for shipping and handling fees and costs and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer. In May 2016, the FASB
also issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,  which
provides clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients. The effective dates for these ASU s
are the same as the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09, for the Company s annual and interim periods beginning January 1,
2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these ASU s on its consolidated financial statements; however at
the current time the Company does not know what impact the adoption of these ASU s will have on its consolidated financial
statements, financial condition or results of operations. 

Note 3. Supplemental Financial Information   

The following tables present details of our condensed consolidated
financial statements: 

Breakdown of the 9% Unsecured Subordinated Convertible Promissory
Note  

  (Maturing December 2018)  

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company
modified the warrant exercise price from $0.45 to $0.30 to stimulate further subscriptions into the 9% Unsecured Convertible Promissory
Note offering, this modification is also applicable to the previous closings. The variance in the modified fair value of the warrants
has been calculated to be $220,490. An amount of $125,511 has been allocated to the debt discount of the subsequent closing which
will be amortized during the life of the debt. The remainder ($94,979) has been expensed immediately and booked as accretion of
debt discounts. During the third quarter of 2016 the Company modified the exercise price from $0.30 to $0.215 to encourage voluntary
conversions. The change in fair value of such modification has been accounted for through the income statement. 

Note 4. Fair Value Measurements   

In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement
( ASC 820 ), the Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer
a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes
a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use
of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. 

Observable inputs are those that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable
inputs reflect the Company s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 

The fair value hierarchy is categorized into
three levels based on the inputs as follows: 

Level 1    Quoted prices are available
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. 

Level 2    Pricing inputs are other
than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The nature of
these financial instruments include cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but are traded less frequently, derivative
instruments whose fair values have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market and
instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed. 

Level 3    Instruments that have
little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These financial instruments are measured using management s best
estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. 

The degree of judgment exercised by the Company
in determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair
value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined by the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. 

The following tables summarize fair value measurements by level
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for and the Company s liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The Company uses
the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the value of the outstanding warrants and conversion feature from the  Offering .
Since the Monte Carlo valuation model requires special software and expertise to model the assumptions to be used, the Company
hired a third party valuation expert. For part of the warrant liabilities the Company had to make a management estimate as insufficient
variables were available in order to determine the value of the particular warrant. 

Note 5. Stockholders 
Equity   

(A) Common Stock  

The Company is presently authorized to
issue 500,000,000 shares common stock. The Company had 171,151,073 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of September
30, 2016, an increase of 9,774,686 shares from December 31, 2015, largely due to the shares issued in connection with the issuance
of 5,116,791 shares as executive staff/officers and directors compensation and/or bonus, 500,000 shares were issued as part of
the Severance and Independent Contractor Agreements with one of the former officers of the Company and another 4,157,895 shares
were issued as part of the conditions with respect to the amendment of the 10% +LIBOR 3 rd  Party Loan. 

Reconciliation with Stock Transfer Agent Records:  

The shares issued and outstanding as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 according to the Company s stock transfer agent s records were 171,396,973 and 161,622,287,
respectively. The difference in number of issued shares recognized by the Company of 171,151,073 amounts to 245,900 and it is the
result of the exclusion of the 233,900 unreturned shares from  cancelled  acquisitions (pre-2006) and 12,000 treasury
shares issued under the former employee benefits plan. 

(B) Preferred Stock  

The Company s Certificate of Incorporation
( Articles ) authorizes the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock $0.00001 par value per share (the  Preferred
Stock ). Under the Company s Articles, the board of directors has the power, without further action by the holders
of the common stock, subject to the rules of the NYSE MKT LLC, to designate the relative rights and preferences of the Preferred
Stock, and issue the Preferred Stock in such one or more series as designated by the Board of Directors. The designation of rights
and preferences could include preferences as to liquidation, redemption and conversion rights, voting rights, dividends or other
preferences, any of which may be dilutive of the interest of the holders of the common stock or the Preferred Stock of any other
series. The issuance of Preferred Stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company without
further stockholder action and may adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock.
In certain circumstances, the issuance of Preferred Stock could depress the market price of the common stock. 

For the period ended September 30, 2016,
the company issued 149 shares of Preferred Stock, and 149 shares of Preferred Stock are still outstanding. The company accounted
for $1,360,571 in Shareholders  (Deficit) Equity being the net of the gross proceeds of $1,490,000 reduced by $129,429 for
legal fees and 8% selling commission for the placement agent. 

(C) Warrants  

Throughout the years, the Company has issued
warrants with varying terms and conditions related to multiple financing rounds, acquisitions and other transactions. The number
of warrants outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 have been recorded and classified as equity is 40,395,398 and
29,628,865 respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded $685,220 and $2,728,742, at September 30, 2016 in the
balance sheet for the warrant liabilities issued in connection with the  Offering  in 2015 and 2016 and a warrant issued
in relation with the second amendment of the 10% +Libor 3 rd  Party Loan. The Weighted Average Exercise Price for the
currently outstanding warrants in the table below is $0.2481. The table below summarizes the warrants outstanding as of September
30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015:  

Beside the above warrants with fixed numbers and exercise rights the Company is also committed to issue
a warrant as part of the second amendment to the initial credit agreement dated November 17, 2014 with Corbin Mezzanine Fund I
for a percentage of 10% of the fully diluted equity of Pareteum Corporation (the parent) as of the date of issuance, however, the
terms of such issuance were to be based on certain conditions determined in a planned rights offering which is still not finalized
and may not be pursued in which case an alternative calculation will have to be agreed between the parties. Based on the outstanding
number of shares and other dilutive outstanding securities management estimated such number of warrants to be 20,000,000.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue
and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition, rebates,
allowances for doubtful accounts, sales returns and allowances, warranty reserves, inventory reserves, stock-based compensation
expense, long-lived asset valuations, strategic investments, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions,
tax contingencies, self-insurance, restructuring costs, litigation and other loss contingencies. We base our estimates and assumptions
on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue,
costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially
and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our
future results of operations will be affected. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer
to the  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  section in Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of our 2015 Annual Report. There have been no material changes
in any of our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Comparison of three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

Revenue   

Revenue for the three months ended September
30, 2016, was $3,170,596, a $315,028 or 9% decrease compared with $3,485,624 for the comparable three months in 2015. The minor
negative EUR vs. USD currency impact was $15,803. 

Revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, was $9,711,288, an $18,031,735 or 65% decrease compared with $27,743,023 for the nine month period in 2015 offset by
a negative EUR vs. USD currency impact of $263,496. The decrease in revenue was the result of the full recognition of deferred
revenue related to the termination of the Iusacell contract in June 2015. In total the Iusacell related revenue reported in the
first nine months of 2015 was $16,583,235. Revenue for the nine months ended 2015, excluding Iusacell, was $11,159,788. 

Cost of Service   

Cost of service includes origination, termination,
network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, network costs, data
center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service
providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the
cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related
costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of service excludes
depreciation and amortization. 

Cost of service for the three month period
ended September 30, 2016 was $892,069, a decrease of $469,278 or 34%, compared with $1,361,347 for the three month period ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of service was primarily the result of reductions of cash and non-cash stock based employee
compensation ($149,487), and a decrease in the cost of mobile bundled services ($241,094). The impact of a slightly higher EUR
vs. USD exchange rate in 2016 positively impacted the variance by $22,536. 

Cost of service for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016 was $2,996,496, a decrease of $1,674,611 or 36%, compared with $4,671,107 for the same period in 2015. 

The positive impact of the higher EUR
versus USD exchange rate in 2016 for the nine months year to date was $59,640.  

The decrease was primarily related to a decrease
in cost of mobile bundled service business and network of $956,616, decrease in cost of service related management   personnel
expenses of $644,820 and a minor reduction of $73,175 in non-cash related expenses.  

Product Development   

Product development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, of employees
involved in the development of the Company's services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture,
and ET BOSS   IN platform development and testing are included in this function. 

Costs
incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software projects, such as those used in the Company s
operations, are capitalized in accordance with the accounting guidance for costs of computer software developed for internal use.
Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the software. When assigning useful lives
to internal-use software, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, competition, technology, and other economic factors.
During the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company capitalized $52,516 and $1,115,955, respectively.
For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company capitalized $990,076 and $3,405,314, respectively. 
 As a result of the ongoing restructuring measures during
the third quarter, that also impacted the development department, the Company decided to suspend project capitalization during
the third quarter of 2016. The amount of $52,516 recorded during the third quarter of 2016 was related to ValidSoft projects.   

Product development costs for the three
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $667,788 and $1,030,143, respectively, a decrease of $362,355 or 35%. The
decrease for the three month period was primarily a result of reduced management and personnel expenses of $935,659 and $490,135
lower non-cash related compensation expenses in 2016 compared with 2015. During the third quarter of 2016 the suspended project
capitalization impacted the product development negatively by $1,063,439. 

For the nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, product development costs were $2,766,690 and $3,556,947, respectively, a decrease of $790,257 or 22%. The decrease
for the nine months was ($2,787,321) largely attributable to the reduced head count reduction following the restructuring plan.
Non-cash compensation related expenses decreased by ($418,174).  The decreased, and in the third quarter of 2016 suspended,
project capitalization impacted the product development negatively by $2,415,238. A higher EUR vs. USD exchange rate in 2016 positively
impacted the result by $28,126. 

Sales and Marketing   

Sales and Marketing expenses consist primarily
of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments
to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building. 

Sales and marketing expenses for the three
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $206,632 and $640,680, respectively, a decrease of $434,048 or 68%. 

For the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 Sales and marketing expenses were $1,094,305 and $1,639,800, respectively, a decrease of $545,495 or 33%. The
decrease is related to $123,011 reduced third party PR and general marketing related expenses, lower management and personnel expenses
of $318,212 and lower non-cash compensation related expenses of $104,272. The higher EUR versus USD exchange rate in 2015 impacted
the result positively by $41,997. 

General and Administrative   

General and administrative expenses are our
largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation, for non-employee directors,
finance and accounting, legal, internal audit and human resources personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate
expenses. 

General and Administrative expenses for the
three month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $3,303,851 and $2,485,671, respectively, an increase of $818,180 or 33%.
For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $8,984,736 and $8,111,048, respectively, an increase of $873,688
or 11%. 

 The increase General and Administrative expenses
included severance costs for the three months and nine months periods totaling $547,985 and $1,380,933, respectively. 

The positive impact of the EUR versus USD exchange
rate in 2016 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $32,037 and $138,516, respectively. 

The decrease in General and Administrative
expenses is primarily the result of the cost reduction measures that started during the fourth quarter of 2015, including reductions
in staff levels and corporate expenses. 

Share-based compensation   

Share-based compensation is comprised of: 

the expensing of the options granted under the 2008 Plan to staff and management;   

the expensing of the shares issued under the 2006 and 2008 Plans to the directors and executive officers in lieu of cash compensation;   

the expensing of restricted shares issued for consultancy services.   

For the three month period ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $796,311 and $937,101, respectively, a decrease of $140,790
or 15%. 

For the nine month period ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we recognized a share-based compensation expense of $2,102,440 and $2,521,424, respectively, a decrease of $418,984
or 17%. 

In the following table we show the allocation
of share-based compensation according to functions in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss, some of the allocations
have become negative (gains) due to the fact that the Company reversed the share-based compensation which it had accounted for
in the past but which due to the large reduction in headcount it was able to undo for unvested employee option expenses: 

Depreciation and Amortization   

Depreciation and amortization expenses
for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was $1,108,553, a decrease of $672,925 or 38%, compared with $1,781,478 for
the same period in 2015. The total depreciation and amortization expenses for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 was
$3,320,104, a decrease of $1,952,555 or 37%, compared with $5,272,659 for the same period in 2015. The decrease for the three and
nine month period is primarily the result of the impairment for assets held and used at the end of 2015 and the termination of
the depreciation and amortization of the Assets Held for Sale. 

Impairment for assets held and used   

In the Company s review of the carrying
amounts of its assets it was determined that following the impact of the recent restructuring on the current project list, $367,268
of certain assets classified under Construction in Progress and Intangible assets needed to be impaired. As the result of the termination
of the Verizon contract the Telnicity LLC intangible assets that were acquired in January 2013 are impaired for a total amount
of $139,069. In September we ceased our Bandung, Indonesia operations. The closing of the local entity resulted in an impairment
loss of $344,648. The total impairment charge, recorded in the third quarter of 2016, is $850,985. 

Impairment of goodwill   

After the divestment of ValidSoft and renewed
strategy the Company decided to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to ValidSoft.  

Following the restructuring and rationalization
that commenced in the fourth quarter 2015 the Morodo and Telnicity related projects were cancelled and the related headcount phased
out. As a result the Company decided to fully impair the carrying value of goodwill related to Morodo and Telnicity. Total impact
of the impairment of goodwill was $3,228,930. 

Loss on sale of assets    

The sale of ValidSoft at the end of the
third quarter for the price of $3.0 million was completed and the Company received $2.0 million in cash and a $1.0 million promissory
note. The $2.0 million in cash was used to pay down the senior secured loan. The divestment of ValidSoft resulted in a net loss
of $1,746,905. In connection with the sale, the Company wrote off $4,577,908 of assets held for sale as of June 30, 2016. 

Interest Income and Expense   

Interest income for the three month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $24,700 and $28,054, respectively a decrease of $3,354 or 12%. Interest income for the nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $75,247 and $80,913, respectively a decrease of $5,666 or 7%. Interest income
consists of interest received on bank balances and interest charged to customers for extended payment terms. 

Interest expense for the three month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $253,509 and $280,182, respectively, a decrease of $26,673 or 10%. Interest expense for
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $856,281 and $1,203,348, respectively, a decrease of $347,067 or
29%. Lower levels of interest expense were the result of the partial repayment of the Libor +10% 3rd Party Loan that occurred during
the second quarter of 2015 and other smaller recurring repayments on the same facility. 

Interest Expense Related to Debt Discount
Accretion   

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, interest expenses related to debt discount accretion were $2,319,679 and $125,086, respectively an increase of $2,194,593
or 1754%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest expenses related to debt discount accretion were $2,932,823
and $592,737, respectively an increase of $2,340,086 or 395%. The increases are mainly caused by the changed conditions of the
amended Libor +10% 3 rd  Party Loan which included various additional debt discount elements and also the agreed upon
revised maturity date of the loan resulting in debt discount being amortized in a shorter period than initially. Also the repayment
with the proceeds of the ValidSoft sale resulted in a pro-rata accelerated amortization. 

Changes in derivative liabilities   

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
was $735,902 (loss) compared with $0 respectively, due to non-existence of warrant liabilities, a decrease of $735,902. Changes
in derivative liabilities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was $75,966 (loss) compared with $395,905
(gain) respectively, a decrease of $471,871 or 119%.  

Change in Fair Value of Conversion Feature  

In December 2015, we consummated two closings
of our private placement offering, the 9% Unsecured Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note ( the Promissory Note )
and in 2016 we closed an additional ten closings. The Promissory Note contains elements which require liability accounting for
the conversion feature. We have calculated the fair market value for the conversion feature at issuance and performed a mark-to-market
adjustment as of each quarter end and have an cumulative change in fair value compared with the initial valuation amounting to
$311,922 which was accounted for through the profit and loss accounts in 2015 and 2016.

in the conversion rights included in the preferred A Shares, the fair market value adjustment made for this instrument was calculated
at $34,283. There was no conversion feature liability in the first nine months of 2015. 

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities  

We have calculated the fair market value
for the warrant liability at issuance and performed a mark-to-market as of each quarter ending and have an cumulative change in
fair value compared with the initial valuation amounting to $24,442 and was accounted for through the profit and loss accounts
in 2015 and 2016. There was no warrant liability in the first nine months of 2015. 

The fair market value of the conversion feature
and warrant liability as part of the 9% Convertible Note was determined by a third party valuation expert using a Monte-Carlo Simulation
model. The fair market value of the warrant as part of the second amendment of the 10% +LIBOR 3 rd  Party Loan has been
a management estimate as several elements of the valuation were not available. 

Gain or loss on extinguishment of debt   

Loss on extinguishment of debt for the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 was $443,426. In the nine months of 2015 the Company recorded $2,475,799 as a gain
on extinguishment of debt. 

The gain in 2015 is the result of the extinguishment
of debt related to the Chong Hing Bank debt of our subsidiary Elephant Talk Ltd in Hong Kong following the expiration of the statute
of limitations in Hong Kong, as well as the verdict by California courts in 2011 that the Company was not liable as a successor
in interest or otherwise, on the bank loans and overdraft account to Elephant Talk Ltd. The loss in 2016 is mainly caused by the
repayment premium on our repayment made on the 10% +LIBOR 3 rd  Party Loan. 

Other Income and (Expense)   

Other income and (expense) for the three
month period ended September 30, 2016 is an income of $101,328 and the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 is an income
of $213,888 and represents the unrealized exchange rate losses related to the 2014 10% + libor 3rd Party Loan against the primary
functional currency (EURO) of the Company. 

Amortization of Deferred Financing
Costs   

Amortization of deferred financing cost
was $568,246 for the three months period ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $527,022 or 1278%, compared with $41,224 for the
three month period ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the deferred financing
costs were $850,541 and $466,571 respectively. 

Provision (Benefit) Income taxes   

Income tax provision for the three month
period ended September 30, 2016 was $8,450, compared with an income tax provision of $6,964 for the same period in 2015. Income
tax provision for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was $27,557, compared with an income tax provision of $49,922
for the same period in 2015. 

Net Loss   

Net loss for the three month period
ended September 30, 2016, was ($13,038,301), an increase in loss of $8,881,964, compared with the loss of
($4,156,337) for the same period in 2015. This increase in loss was mainly caused by the net loss on sale of assets
($1,746,905), Impairment of goodwill ($3,228,930), impairment for assets held and used of ($850,985) as well as the interest
expense related to debt discount and conversion feature ($2,319,679). 

Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income   

We record foreign currency translation
gains and losses as part of other comprehensive (loss) Income, which amounted to an income of $425,354 and a loss of $64,444 for
the three month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The foreign currency translation for the nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 was an income of $421,091, compared with a loss of ($1,268,064) for the same period in 2015. This change
is primarily attributable to the significant sale and impairments of assets. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company reported net loss of ($20,175,322)
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and had an accumulated deficit of ($275,810,853) as of September
30, 2016. 

The Company s financial statements through September 30, 2016
were materially impacted by a number of events: 

Divestiture of ValidSoft, on September 30, 2016, through
a management buyout; 

Financing activity related to issuance of preferred
shares and increase in note payable with its senior secured lender; 

the settlement with Cross River Investments ( CRI ) to issue 4.4 million common shares related to the previous advance paid to complete the acquisition of ValidSoft; and   

the restructuring of the Company.   

The substantial three phase restructuring plan
(the  Plan ) was completed in the third quarter 2016. The Plan which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015, was designed
to align actual expenses and investments with current revenues as well as introduce new executive management. 

The first and second phase of the Plan encompassed
fourth quarter 2015 through second quarter 2016. The third and final phase of the Plan impacted third quarter 2016 results with
a $0.6 million in workforce reduction expenses primarily related to employee severances. Total workforce related restructuring
charges to-date is $2.7 million including non-cash charges of $0.7 million. 

The annualized savings in ongoing operating
expenses following the three phases of restructuring through the third quarter 2016, is approximately $10.0 million related to
reduction in full-time equivalent (FTE) headcount. At the end of third quarter 2016, FTE headcount was 82, down from 265 prior
to the three phase restructuring program and more sustainably aligned with current revenues. Included in the headcount reduction
during the first nine months of 2016 are 59 FTEs that resigned voluntarily. 

During the second and third phases of the restructuring,
in addition to its cost reduction initiatives, the Company took steps to broaden its revenue focus, pivoting towards additional
services including but not limited to recent complementary product initiatives. 

The reaffirmation by the Company s largest
customer, during the third quarter, underscores the quality of the Company s services and the expectation of adding incremental
subscribers. 

The Company suffered a liquidity crunch during
the third quarter and its senior lender provided an additional $1.2 million in funding. The maturity date for the loan was changed
to December 31, 2016 and a series of premiums were established as incentives to encourage the Company to pay off the outstanding
loan prior to December 31, 2016. 

The sale of ValidSoft at the end of the third
quarter for the price of $3.0 million was completed and the Company received $2.0 million in cash and a $1.0 million promissory
note. The $2.0 million in cash was used to pay down the senior secured loan. 

As part of the expired agreement with the prospective suitor
for ValidSoft, the Company received $700,000 in 2016, and during the third quarter the Company issued 4.4 million common shares
to CRI in full settlement. 

During the second quarter 2016, the Company
signed a non-binding definitive term sheets with prospective Lenders, which were expected to have resulted in an injection of immediate
working capital and establish a basis for raising additional capital in support of both its restructuring and new growth initiatives.
A series of delays beyond the control of the Company, raised substantial doubt on whether this funding can be counted upon to ease
the financial stress on the Company and in cooperation with its senior lender these negotiations were terminated in the third quarter. 

The current senior Lender, Atalaya, continues
to work with the Company to find solutions including but not limited to proposed issuances of new equity, warrant and option solicitations
and interim sources of capital. Until such new capital is secured and the senior Lender has been assured of satisfactory payoff,
the Company is primarily responsible to this debtholder. The Company s largest customer is fully aware of the critical need
to secure additional sources of capital and is working constructively in support of these initiatives. Effective August 15, 2016,
Atalaya has increased its loan to the Company by an additional $1.2 million. As a condition of the funding of the increase, the
largest customer has provided a comfort letter indicating its desire to increase its business with the Company. 

The cash balance of the Company at September
30, 2016 was $ 977,106. Additional capital is required during the fourth quarter 2016 to cover working capital deficiencies. The
incremental loan during the third quarter provided vital liquidity in the short term and the Company is pursuing additional capital. 

Although the Company has previously been able
to raise capital as needed, there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available at all, or if available, on reasonable
terms. Further, the terms of such financing may be dilutive to our existing stockholders or otherwise on terms not favorable to
us, or our existing stockholders. If we are unable to secure additional capital, and/or do not succeed in meeting our cash flow
objectives or the Lender takes steps to call the loan before new capital is attracted, the Company will be materially and negatively
impacted, and we may have to significantly reduce our operations. 

As of September 30, 2016, the completion of
the restructuring and divestiture of Validsoft dramatically improve the pro forma operating results for the Company. However, until
the maturity date of the senior debt is extended and substantial new equity capital is secured, doubt remains concerning the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. The additional $1.2 million of capital provided by Atalaya on August 15 th  is treated as short-term
bridge financing to help the Company complete an issuance of equity and/or divest assets. 

Operating activities  

As a result of the above, cash used in
operating activities was $2,458,297 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with net cash provided by operating activities
of $9,025,028 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Investing activities  

Net cash provided by investing activities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,067,873, a decrease of $7,793,641, compared with cash used in investing activities
of $6,725,768 in the same period in 2015. This change is the result of the decrease in the capitalization of product development
costs totaling $2,415,238, decrease of lease installments $1,356,967 and less third party capital expenditures of $1,571,436. 

The proceeds of the sale of ValidSoft, included
in the net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $2,000,000. 

Financing activities  

Net cash provided by (used in) financing
activities for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,158,244 and ($3,644,807), respectively. In June 2015, anticipatory
to an amendment of the original credit agreement combined with the receipt of the Iusacell settlement payment, the Company transferred
$10,100,000 towards the lenders pending the closing of the amendment of the credit agreement. 

During the first nine months of 2016 the
Company received $2,273,000 as proceeds from the 9% Unsecured Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note in the first quarter, $350,000
was received as a subordinated loan in the second quarter, $1,490,000 gross proceed was received as a result of the offering of
Preferred A Shares, $2,000,000 was received as a result of the sale of ValidSoft, $466,711 is the net outflow relating to the additional
financing and early repayment with respect to the Libor +10% third part loan and $1,427,967 was paid for financing related fees
as a result the financing related activities which all happened in the third quarter. 

Effect of exchange rates on cash and
cash equivalents  

Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash
equivalents for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was ($159,944), compared with $300,298 for the same period in 2015. 

As a result of the above activities, for
the nine month ended September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $977,106, a net increase in cash and cash equivalents
of $607,856 since December 31, 2015. 

Off- Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have either a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors,
nor we have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special
purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually
narrow or limited purposes. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market
Risks  

Foreign currency exchange rate   

Although the vast majority of our business
activities are carried out in Euros, we report its financial statements in USD. The conversion of Euros and USD leads to period-to-period
fluctuations in our reported USD results arising from changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the Euro. Generally, when
the USD strengthens relative to the Euro, it has an unfavorable impact on our reported revenue and income and a favorable impact
on our reported expenses. Conversely, when the USD weakens relative to the Euro, it produces a favorable impact on our reported
revenue and income, and an unfavorable impact on our reported expenses. The above fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rate therefore
result in currency translation effects (not to be confused with real currency exchange effects), which impact our reported USD
results and may make it difficult to determine actual increases and decreases in our revenue and expenses which are attributable
to our actual operating activities. We carry out our business activities primarily in Euros, and we do not currently engage in
hedging activities. As the vast majority of our business activities are carried out in Euros and we report our financial statements
in USD, fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the total amount of assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries
upon the translation of those amounts in USD. We do not believe that we have currently material exposure to interest rate or other
market risk 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

As of September 30, 2016 the Company carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on
the evaluation, the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting   

There have been no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
