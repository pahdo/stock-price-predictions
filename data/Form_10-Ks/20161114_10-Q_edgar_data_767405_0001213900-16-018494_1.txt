   NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)   

NOTE
1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

SB
Financial Group, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the  Company ) is a bank holding company whose principal activity is the
ownership and management of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, The State Bank and Trust Company ( State Bank ), RFCBC,
Inc. ( RFCBC ), Rurbanc Data Services, Inc. dba RDSI Banking Systems ( RDSI ), and Rurban Statutory Trust
II ( RST II ). In addition, State Bank owns all of the outstanding stock of Rurban Mortgage Company ( RMC )
and State Bank Insurance, LLC ( SBI ).  

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, State Bank, RFCBC, RDSI, RMC, and SBI. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of
the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The financial
statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of the Company. Those adjustments consist only of normal recurring adjustments. Results of
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of results for the complete year.  

The
condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of that date.  

For
further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The
following paragraphs summarize the impact of new accounting pronouncements:  

Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13: Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326)   

This
ASU replaces the current GAAP incurred impairment methodology regarding credit losses with a methodology that reflects expected
credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
The amendments in this update affect an entity to varying degrees depending on the credit quality of the assets held by the entity,
their duration, and how the entity applies current GAAP. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2019, and management will need further study to determine the impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.  

ASU
No. 2016-09: Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   

This
ASU affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The update is intended to simplify the accounting
for these transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
and management will need further study to determine the impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
No. 2016-06: Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)   

This
ASU clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal
on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments
in this Update is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and management does not believe
this ASU will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
No. 2016-05: Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)   

This
ASU clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument
under Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedging
accounting criteria continue to be met. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016, and management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
No. 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842)   

This
ASU is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities
on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and management will need further study to determine the impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
No. 2016-01: Financial Instruments   Recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities (Subtopic
825-10)   

This
ASU makes targeted improvements to generally accepted accounting principles. Specifically, the amendments require equity securities
with readily determinable fair values be classified into different categories and require equity securities to be measured at
fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and management does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
No. 2015-16: Business Combinations (Topic 805)   

This
ASU requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in
the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Further, an entity must present separately on the face of
the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings that would have been
recorded previously if the provisional amounts had been recorded as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU are in
effect, and they did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
No. 2015-15: Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)   

This
ASU requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability. The amendments in this ASU are in effect, and they did not have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
No. 2015-14: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 606)   

This
ASU defers by one year the effective date of the guidance in ASU 2014-09. The amendments in this ASU are now effective for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and management still does not believe this ASU will have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE
2 EARNINGS PER SHARE   

Earnings
per share (EPS) have been computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
For the period ended September 30, 2016, share-based awards totaling 0 common shares were not considered in computing diluted
EPS as they were anti-dilutive. For the period ended September 30, 2015, share-based awards totaling 50,424 common shares were
not considered in computing diluted EPS as they were anti-dilutive. Included in the diluted EPS for September 30, 2016 are the
impact of the full conversion of the Company s depository shares issued in December of 2014. Based upon the current conversion
ratio, the 1,500,000 outstanding depository shares are convertible into an aggregate of 1,454,702 common shares. The average number
of common shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were:  

Note
3 - Securities   

The
amortized cost and appropriate fair values, together with gross unrealized gains and losses, of securities at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 were as follows:  

The
amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below.
Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with
or without call or prepayment penalties.  

The
fair value of securities pledged as collateral, to secure public deposits and for other purposes, was $76.6 million at September
30, 2016 and $42.6 million at December 31, 2015. The fair value of securities delivered for repurchase agreements were $15.8 million
at September 30, 2016 and $15.8 million at December 31, 2015.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were gross gains of $0.26 million resulting from sales of available-for-sale securities,
which was a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and was included in the net gain on sale of securities.
The related $0.09 million in tax expense was a reclassification from OCI and was included in the income tax expense line item
in the income statement. There were no realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Certain
investments in debt securities are reported in the financial statements at an amount less than their historical cost. Total fair
value of these investments was $8.3 million at September 30, 2016, and $37.2 million at December 31, 2015, which was approximately
9 and 34 percent, respectively, of the Company s available-for-sale investment portfolio at such dates. Based on evaluation
of available evidence, including recent changes in market interest rates, credit rating information and information obtained from
regulatory filings, management believes the declines in fair value for these securities are temporary. Should the impairment of
any of these securities become other than temporary, the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss recognized
in net income in the period the other-than-temporary impairment is identified.  

Securities
with unrealized losses, aggregated by investment class and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous
unrealized loss position, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:  

The
total potential unrealized loss as of September 30, 2016 in the securities portfolio was $0.03 million, which was down from the
$0.43 million unrealized loss at December 31, 2015. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least
on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concern warrants such evaluation. Consideration is given to
(1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent of the Company to not sell the investment and whether it is more likely than not that
the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. Management has determined there is no
other-than-temporary-impairment on these securities.  

NOTE
4   LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES   

Loans
that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoffs, are reported at their
outstanding principal balances adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses, any deferred fees or costs on originated
loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Interest income is reported on the interest method and includes
amortization of net deferred loan fees and costs over the loan term. Generally, all loan classes are placed on non-accrual status
not later than 90 days past due, unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection. All interest accrued, but not
collected, for loans that are placed on non-accrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these
loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to
accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably
assured.  

The
allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged
to income. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the non-collectability of a loan balance is
probable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.  

The
allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of
the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations
that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions.
This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as new information
becomes available.  

The
allowance consists of allocated and general components. The allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired.
For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value
or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non-classified
loans and is based on historical charge-off experience and expected loss given default derived from the Company s internal
risk rating process. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external
influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected on the historical loss or risk rating data.  

A
loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that State Bank will be unable to collect
the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered
by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal
and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified
as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into
consideration each of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons
for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest
owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial, agricultural, and construction loans by either the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market
price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  

When
State Bank moves a loan to non-accrual status, total unpaid interest accrued to date is reversed from income. Subsequent payments
are applied to the outstanding principal balance with the interest portion of the payment recorded on the balance sheet as a contra-loan.
Interest received on impaired loans may be realized once all contractual principal amounts are received or when a borrower establishes
a history of six consecutive timely principal and interest payments. It is at the discretion of management to determine when a
loan is placed back on accrual status upon receipt of six consecutive timely payments.  

Large
groups of smaller balance homogenous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, State Bank does not separately
identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring
agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower.  

Categories
of loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include:  

The
following tables present the activity in the allowance for loan losses and the recorded investment in loans based on portfolio
segment and impairment method as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015.  

The
risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows:  

Commercial
and Agricultural   

Commercial
and agricultural loans are primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral
provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans
may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts
receivable or inventory, and may include a personal guarantee. Short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case
of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent
on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers.  

Commercial
Real Estate including Construction   

Commercial
real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate
lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful
operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate
loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The characteristics of
properties securing the Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse, but with geographic location almost entirely
in the Company s market area. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography
and risk grade criteria. In general, the Company avoids financing single purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are
present to help mitigate risk. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate versus non-owner-occupied
loans.  

Construction
loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews and financial analysis of the developers and
property owners. Construction loans are generally based on estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project.
These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially
dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent
loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the Company until permanent
financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other
real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property,
general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing.  

Residential
and Consumer   

Residential
and consumer loans consist of two segments   residential mortgage loans and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans are
secured by 1-4 family residences and are generally owner-occupied, and the Company generally establishes a maximum loan-to-value
ratio and requires private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded. Home equity loans are typically secured by a subordinate
interest in 1-4 family residences, and consumer personal loans are secured by consumer personal assets, such as automobiles or
recreational vehicles. Some consumer personal loans are unsecured, such as small installment loans and certain lines of credit.
Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions
in their market areas, such as unemployment levels. Repayment can also be impacted by changes in property values on residential
properties. Risk is mitigated by the fact that these loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of
borrowers.  

The
following tables present the credit risk profile of the Company s loan portfolio based on rating category and payment activity
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The
Company evaluates the loan risk grading system definitions and allowance for loan loss methodology on an ongoing basis.  

Credit
Risk Profile    

  The
Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt
such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic
trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis
includes loans with an outstanding balance greater than $100 thousand and non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and commercial
real estate loans. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:  

Pass
(grades 1   4):   Loans which management has determined to be performing as expected and in agreement with the terms
established at the time of loan origination.  

Special
Mention (5):   Assets have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these
potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position
at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant
adverse classification. Ordinarily, special mention credits have characteristics which corrective management action would remedy.  

Substandard
(6):   Loans are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral
pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  

Doubtful
(7):   Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic
that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current known facts, conditions and values, highly
questionable and improbable.  

Loss
(8):   Loans are considered uncollectable and of such little value that continuing to carry them as assets on the Company s
financial statement is not feasible. Loans will be classified Loss when it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing
off or reserving all or a portion of a basically worthless asset, even though partial recovery may be possible at some time in
the future.  

The
following tables present the Company s loan portfolio aging analysis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

All
loans past due 90 days are systematically placed on nonaccrual status.  

A
loan is considered impaired, in accordance with the impairment accounting guidance (ASC 310-10-35-16), when based on current information
and events, it is probable State Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual
terms of the loan. Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans but also include loans modified in troubled debt restructurings
where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions could include a reduction
in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize
collection.  

The
following tables present impaired loan information as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015:  

Impaired
loans less than $100,000 are included in groups of homogenous loans. These loans are evaluated based on delinquency status.  

Interest
income recognized on a cash basis does not materially differ from interest income recognized on an accrual basis.  

Troubled
Debt Restructured (TDR) Loans    

TDRs
are modified loans where a concession was provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loan modifications are considered
TDRs when the concessions provided are not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources. However,
not all loan modifications are TDRs.  

TDR
Concession Types   

The
Company s standards relating to loan modifications consider, among other factors, minimum verified income requirements,
cash flow analysis, and collateral valuations. Each potential loan modification is reviewed individually and the terms of the
loan are modified to meet a borrower s specific circumstances at a point in time. All loan modifications, including those
classified as TDRs, are reviewed and approved. The types of concessions provided to borrowers include:  

Interest
                                         rate reduction: A reduction of the stated interest rate to a nonmarket rate for the remaining
                                         original life of the loan. The Company also may grant interest rate concessions for a
                                         limited timeframe on a case by case basis.    

Amortization
                                         or maturity date change: A change in the amortization or maturity date beyond what the
                                         collateral supports, including a concession that does any of the following:    

(1)    Lengthens
                                         the amortization period of the amortized principal beyond market terms. This concession
                                         reduces the minimum monthly payment and increases the amount of the balloon payment at
                                         the end of the term of the loan. Principal is generally not forgiven.    

(2)    Reduces
                                         the amount of loan principal to be amortized. This concession also reduces the minimum
                                         monthly payment and increases the amount of the balloon payment at the end of the term
                                         of the loan. Principal is generally not forgiven.    

(3)    Extends
                                         the maturity date or dates of the debt beyond what the collateral supports. This concession
                                         generally applies to loans without a balloon payment at the end of the term of the loan.
                                         In addition, there may be instances where renewing loans potentially require non-market
                                         terms and would then be reclassified as TDRs.    

Other:
                                         A concession that is not categorized as one of the concessions described above. These
                                         concessions include, but are not limited to: principal forgiveness, collateral concessions,
                                         covenant concessions, and reduction of accrued interest. Principal forgiveness may result
                                         from any TDR modification of any concession type.

NOTE
5   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS   

Risk
Management Objective of Using Derivatives   

The
Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company manages its
exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks primarily through management of its core business activities. The
Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources
and duration of its assets and liabilities and through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company
enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt
or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company s
derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company s known
or expected cash payments principally related to certain variable-rate assets.  

Non-designated
Hedges   

The
Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative
and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial
banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously offset
by interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting
from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements,
changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the notional amount of customer-facing swaps was approximately $30.1 million and $17.6 million,
respectively. The same amounts were offset with third party counterparties, as described above.  

The
Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with its derivative counterparties. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company had posted cash as collateral in the amount of $1.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively.  

The
table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments, as well as their classification on
the Balance Sheet, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Securities
Sold Under Repurchase Agreements   

State
Bank has retail repurchase agreements to facilitate cash management transactions with commercial customers. These obligations
are secured by agency and mortgage-backed securities and such collateral is held by the Federal Home Loan Bank. The agreements
mature within one month. These repurchase agreements are secured by agency securities and mortgage-backed securities with corresponding
liabilities of $5.7 million and of $14.9 million. These securities have various maturity dates beyond 2017.  

NOTE
6   FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES   

Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs. There is a hierarchy of three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level 1   
      Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities      

Level 2   
      Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable
or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities   

Level 3   
      Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or
no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities   

Following
is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, recognized
in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as the general classifications of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.  

Available-for-Sale
Securities   

The
fair values of available-for-sale securities are determined by various valuation methodologies. Level 1 securities include money
market mutual funds. Level 1 inputs include quoted prices in an active market. Level 2 securities include U.S. treasury and government
agencies, mortgage-backed securities, obligations of political and state subdivisions and equity securities. Level 2 inputs do
not include quoted prices for individual securities in active markets; however, they do include inputs that are either directly
or indirectly observable for the individual security being valued. Such observable inputs include interest rates and yield curves
at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks and default rates. Also included are inputs derived
principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.  

Interest
Rate Contracts   

The
fair values of interest rate contracts are based upon the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts
or agreements, taking into account underlying interest rates, creditworthiness of underlying customers for credit derivatives
and, when appropriate, the creditworthiness of the counterparties.  

The
following table presents the fair value measurements of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within
the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis and recognized in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the
valuation hierarchy.  

Collateral-dependent
Impaired Loans, NET of ALLL   

Loans
for which it is probable the Company will not collect all principal and interest due according to contractual terms are measured
for impairment. The estimated fair value of collateral-dependent impaired loans is based on the appraised value of the collateral,
less estimated cost to sell. Collateral-dependent impaired loans are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. This
method requires obtaining an independent appraisal of the collateral, which is reviewed for accuracy and consistency by Credit
Administration. These appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained by management. The appraised values
are reduced by applying a discount factor to the value based on the Company s loan review policy. All impaired loans held
by the Company were collateral dependent at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Mortgage
Servicing Rights   

Mortgage
servicing rights do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, fair value is estimated using
discounted cash flow models associated with the servicing rights and discounting the cash flows using discount market rates, prepayment
speeds and default rates. The servicing portfolio has been valued using all relevant positive and negative cash flows including
servicing fees; miscellaneous income and float; marginal costs of servicing; the cost of carry of advances; and foreclosure losses;
and applying certain prevailing assumptions used in the marketplace. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, mortgage servicing
rights are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. These mortgage servicing rights are tested for impairment on a quarterly
basis.

(Level 3) Inputs   

The
following table presents quantitative information about unobservable inputs used in recurring and nonrecurring Level 3 fair value
measurements.

There
were no changes in the inputs or methodologies used to determine fair value at September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31,
2015.  

The
following methods were used to estimate the fair value of all other financial instruments recognized in the accompanying balance
sheets at amounts other than fair value.  

Cash
and Due From Banks, Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock and Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable   

The
carrying amount approximates the fair value.  

Loans
Held for Sale   

The
fair value of loans held for sale is based upon quoted market prices, where available, or is determined by discounting estimated
cash flows using interest rates approximating the Company s current origination rates for similar loans and adjusted to
reflect the inherent credit risk.  

Loans   

The
estimated fair value for loans receivable is based on estimates of the rate State Bank would charge for similar loans at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, applied for the time period until the loans are assumed to re-price or be paid.  

Mortgage
Servicing Rights   

Mortgage
servicing rights do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, fair value is estimated using
discounted cash flow models associated with the servicing rights and discounting the cash flows using discount market rates, prepayment
speeds and default rates. The servicing portfolio has been valued using all relevant positive and negative cash flows including
servicing fees, miscellaneous income and float; marginal costs of servicing; the cost of carry of advances; and foreclosure losses;
and applying certain prevailing assumptions used in the marketplace. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, mortgage servicing
rights are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. These mortgage servicing rights are tested for impairment on a quarterly
basis.  

Deposits,
FHLB advances   Repurchase agreements   

Deposits
include demand deposits, savings accounts, NOW accounts and certain money market deposits. The carrying amount approximates the
fair value. The estimated fair value for fixed-maturity time deposits, as well as borrowings, is based on estimates of the rate
State Bank could pay on similar instruments with similar terms and maturities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Loan
Commitments   

The
fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account
the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. The estimated fair values for other
financial instruments and off-balance-sheet loan commitments approximate cost at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and
are not considered significant to this presentation.  

Trust
Preferred Securities   

The
fair value for Trust Preferred Securities is estimated by discounting the cash flows using an appropriate discount rate.  

The
following table presents estimated fair values of the Company s other financial instruments carried at other than fair value.
The fair values of certain of these instruments were calculated by discounting expected cash flows, which involves significant
judgments by management and uncertainties. Fair value is the estimated amount at which financial assets or liabilities could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Because no market exists
for certain of these financial instruments, and because management does not intend to sell these financial instruments, the Company
does not know whether the fair values shown below represent values at which the respective financial instruments could be sold
individually or in the aggregate.  

NOTE
7   GENERAL LITIGATION   

The
Company is subject to claims and lawsuits that arise primarily in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, the Company is
subject to periodic examinations by various regulatory agencies. It is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate
resolution of such claims, lawsuits and examinations will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flow of the Company.

Recent
Regulatory Developments     

Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010   

The
Dodd-Frank Act was enacted into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act is significantly changing the regulation of financial
institutions and the financial services industry. Because the Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad
range of regulations with significant discretion, many of the details of the new law and the effects they will have on the Company
will not be known for months and even years.  

Among
the provisions already implemented pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the following provisions have or may have an effect on the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries:  

the
                                         CFPB has been formed with broad powers to adopt and enforce consumer protection regulations;   

the
                                         federal law prohibiting the payment of interest on commercial demand deposit accounts
                                         was eliminated effective July 21, 2011;   

the
                                         standard maximum amount of deposit insurance per customer was permanently increased to
                                         $250,000;    

the
                                         assessment base for determining deposit insurance premiums has been expanded from domestic
                                         deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity;    

public
                                         companies in all industries are or will be required to provide shareholders the opportunity
                                         to cast a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation;    

new
                                         capital regulations for bank holding companies have been adopted, which will impose stricter
                                         requirements, and any new trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, will
                                         no longer constitute Tier I capital; and   

new
                                         corporate governance requirements applicable generally to all public companies in all
                                         industries require new compensation practices and disclosure requirements, including
                                         requiring companies to  claw back  incentive compensation under certain circumstances,
                                         to consider the independence of compensation advisors and to make additional disclosures
                                         in proxy statements with respect to compensation matters.     

Many
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been implemented and will require interpretation and rule making by federal regulators.
As a result, the full effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company cannot yet be determined. However, it is likely that the implementation
of these provisions will increase compliance costs and fees paid to regulators, along with possibly restricting the operations
of the Company and its subsidiaries.  

The
Volcker Rule   

In
December 2013, five federal agencies adopted a final regulation implementing the Volcker Rule provision of the Dodd-Frank Act
(the  Volcker Rule ). The Volcker Rule places limits on the trading activity of insured depository institutions and
entities affiliated with a depository institution, subject to certain exceptions. The trading activity includes a purchase or
sale as principal of a security, derivative, commodity future or option on any such instrument in order to benefit from short-term
price movements or to realize short-term profits. The Volcker Rule exempts specified U.S. Government, agency and/or municipal
obligations, and it excepts trading conducted in certain capacities, including as a broker or other agent, through a deferred
compensation or pension plan, as a fiduciary on behalf of customers, to satisfy a debt previously contracted, repurchase and securities
lending agreements and risk-mitigating hedging activities.  

The
Volcker Rule also prohibits a banking entity from having an ownership interest in, or certain relationships with, a hedge fund
or private equity fund, with a number of exceptions. The Company does not engage in any of the trading activities or have any
ownership interest in or relationship with any of the types of funds regulated by the Volcker Rule.  

Executive
and Incentive Compensation   

In
June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies
(the  Joint Guidance ) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not
undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. This principles-based guidance,
which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually
or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements
should (a) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify
and manage risks, (b) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (c) be supported by strong corporate
governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors.  

Pursuant
to the Joint Guidance, the Federal Reserve Board will review as part of a regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive
compensation arrangements of financial institutions such as the Company. Such reviews will be tailored to each organization based
on the scope and complexity of the organization s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements.
The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination and deficiencies will be incorporated into
the institution s supervisory ratings, which can affect the institution s ability to make acquisitions and take other
actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against an institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management
control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and prompt and effective measures
are not being taken to correct the deficiencies.  

On
February 7, 2011, federal banking regulatory agencies jointly issued proposed rules on incentive-based compensation arrangements
under applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the  Proposed Rules ). The Proposed Rules generally apply to financial
institutions with $1.0 billion or more in assets that maintain incentive-based compensation arrangements for certain covered employees.
The Proposed Rules (i) prohibit covered financial institutions from maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that
encourage covered persons to expose the institution to inappropriate risk by providing the covered person with  excessive 
compensation; (ii) prohibit covered financial institutions from establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements
for covered persons that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss, (iii) require covered financial
institutions to maintain policies and procedures appropriate to their size, complexity and use of incentive-based compensation
to help ensure compliance with the Proposed Rules and (iv) require covered financial institutions to provide enhanced disclosure
to regulators regarding their incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered person within 90 days following the end of
the fiscal year.  

Pursuant
to rules adopted by the stock exchanges and approved by the SEC in January 2013 under the Dodd-Frank Act, public companies are
required to implement  clawback  procedures for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the
procedures which allow recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating
a restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. This policy is intended to apply to compensation
paid within a three-year look-back window of the restatement and would cover all executives who received incentive awards. Public
company compensation committee members are also required to meet heightened independence requirements and to consider the independence
of compensation consultants, legal counsel and other advisors to the compensation committee. The compensation committees must
have the authority to hire advisors and to have the company fund reasonable compensation of such advisors.  

Effect
of Environmental Regulation   

Compliance
with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to
the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position
of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company believes that the nature of the operations of its subsidiaries has little, if
any, environmental impact. The Company, therefore, anticipates no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities
for its current fiscal year or for the foreseeable future. The Company s subsidiaries may be required to make capital expenditures
for environmental control facilities related to properties which they may acquire through foreclosure proceedings in the future;
however, the amount of such capital expenditures, if any, is not currently determinable.  

Regulatory
Capital   

The
FRB has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and for state member banks, such as State Bank. The risk-based
capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning assets
and off-balance-sheet items to broad risk categories. Prior to January 1, 2015, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted
assets (including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) was 8%. Of that 8%, at least 4% was required
to be comprised of common shareholders  equity (including retained earnings but excluding treasury stock), non-cumulative
perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests in equity accounts
of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets ( Tier 1 capital ). The remainder
of total risk-based capital ( Tier 2 capital ) may consist, among other things, of certain amounts of mandatory convertible
debt securities, subordinated debt, preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 capital, allowance for loan and lease losses and
net unrealized gains, after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values, all
subject to limitations established by the guidelines. Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to
the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of four risk weights (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) is applied
to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The
capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings
and other factors.  

In
July 2013, the FRB and the federal banking agencies published final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital
rules applicable to the Company and State Bank. These rules implement the  Basel III  regulatory capital reforms and
changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Basel III  refers to various documents released by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision.  

Effective
January 1, 2015, State Bank and the Company became subject to new capital regulations under BASEL III (with some provisions transitioned
into full effectiveness over two to four years). The new requirements create a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 ( CET1 )
capital, increases the leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changes the risk-weights of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based
capital ratios, creates an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios and changes what qualifies
as capital for purposes of meeting these various capital requirements. These new capital requirements are as follows: leverage
ratio of 4% of adjusted total assets, total capital ratio of 8% of risk-weighted assets and the Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% of
risk-weighted assets. In addition, the Company will have to meet the new minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets.
CET1 consists generally of common stock, retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), subject to certain
adjustments. Beginning in 2016, failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will limit the ability of the Company
to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses.  

Mortgage
servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common
stock will be deducted from capital, subject to a two-year transition period. In addition, Tier 1 capital will include AOCI, which
includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities, subject to a two-year transition period.
State Bank decided in the first quarter of 2015 to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in its capital calculations to
reduce the impact of market volatility on its regulatory capital levels.  

The
new requirements under BASEL III also include changes in the risk-weights of certain assets to better reflect credit risk and
other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition,
development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual
status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year
or less; a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital;
and increased risk-weights (0% to 600%) for equity exposures.  

In
addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, State Bank will have to maintain a capital conservation buffer
consisting of additional CET1 capital equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above each of the required minimum capital levels
in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying certain discretionary bonuses. This
new capital conservation buffer requirement is phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing
each year until fully implemented in January 2019.  

The
FRB s prompt corrective action standards will change when these new capital ratios become effective. Under the new standards,
in order to be considered well-capitalized, State Bank will be required to have at least a CET1 ratio of 6.5% (new), a Tier 1
ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged) and not be subject
to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital ratio for a capital measure.  

State
Bank conducted a proforma analysis of the application of these new capital requirements as of June 30, 2016. Based on that analysis,
State Bank determined that it meets all these new requirements, including the full 2.5% capital conservation buffer, and would
remain well capitalized if these new requirements had been in effect on that date. (see Note 13) In addition, as noted above,
beginning in 2016, if State Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to the Company
would be limited.  

In
April 2015, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule which increased the size limitation for qualifying bank holding companies
under the Federal Reserve Board s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $500 million to $1 billion of total consolidated
assets. As a result, the Company now qualifies under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement for exemption from the Federal
Reserve Board s consolidated risk-based capital and leverage rules at the holding company level.  

Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC )   

The
FDIC is an independent federal agency which insures the deposits of federally-insured banks and savings associations up to certain
prescribed limits and safeguards the safety and soundness of financial institutions. State Bank s deposits are subject to
the deposit insurance assessments of the FDIC. Under the FDIC s deposit insurance assessment system, the assessment rate
for any insured institution may vary according to regulatory capital levels of the institution and other factors such as supervisory
evaluations.  

In
addition, the FDIC has proposed changing the deposit insurance premium assessment method for banks with less than $10 billion
in assets that have been insured by the FDIC for at least five years. The proposed changes would revise the financial ratios method
so that it would be based on a statistical model estimating the probability of failure of a bank over three years; update the
financial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical model; and eliminate risk categories for
established small banks and use the financial ratios method to determine assessment rates for all such banks (subject to minimum
or maximum initial assessment rates based upon a bank s composite examination rating).  

The
FDIC is authorized to prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity that poses a serious threat to the insurance
fund and may initiate enforcement actions against a bank, after first giving the institution s primary regulatory authority
an opportunity to take such action. The FDIC may also terminate the deposit insurance of any institution that has engaged in or
is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable
law, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Note
1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015 describes the significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of the Company s
financial statements. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Company s
financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions and are integral to the understanding
of reported results. Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal
of the Company s financial condition and results, and they require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective,
and/or complex.  

Allowance
for Loan Losses -  The allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses inherent in the Company s loan
portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses each quarter based on changes, if any, in underwriting
activities, loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations), trends
in loan performance, regulatory guidance and economic factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires the use
of significant management estimates. Many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses, including
volatility of default probabilities, rating migrations, loss severity and economic and political conditions. The allowance is
increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.  

The
Company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. The allowance recorded
for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans
and actual loss experience. The allowance recorded for homogeneous consumer loans is based on an analysis of loan mix, risk characteristics
of the portfolio, fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences, and historical losses, adjusted for current trends, for each homogeneous
category or group of loans. The allowance for credit losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable
market price, the collateral for certain collateral-dependent loans, or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective
interest rate.  

Regardless
of the extent of the Company s analysis of customer performance, portfolio trends or risk management processes, certain
inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio. This is due to several factors, including inherent delays
in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions, the
subjective nature of individual loan evaluations, collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends. Volatility
of economic or customer-specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger non-homogeneous credits
and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are also factors. The Company
estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures. The estimates are based upon the Company s
evaluation of imprecise risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current
economic environment. To the extent that actual results differ from management s estimates, additional loan loss provisions
may be required that could adversely impact earnings for future periods.  

Goodwill
and Other Intangibles  -   The Company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including
goodwill and other intangibles, at fair value as required. Goodwill is subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment.
Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line or accelerated methods, and are subject
to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount. The initial goodwill and
other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates
of how the acquired asset will perform in the future. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include,
among others, customer attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, specific industry conditions and changes in competition. A
decrease in earnings resulting from these or other factors could lead to an impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact
earnings for future periods.  

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Net
Income:   Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $2.5 million compared to net income of $2.3 million for the third
quarter of 2015, an increase of 13 percent. Earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.40 were up 14 percent from the $0.35 for the
third quarter of 2015.  

Provision
for Loan Losses:   The third quarter provision for loan losses was $0.0 million compared to $0.1 million for the year-ago
quarter. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $0.13 million compared to net charge-offs of $0.30 million for the year-ago quarter.
Total delinquent loans ended the quarter at $2.8 million, which is down $3.7 million from the prior year or 0.17 percent of average
loans.  

Consolidated
Revenue :    Total revenue, consisting of net interest income and noninterest income, was $11.7 million for the third
quarter of 2016, an increase of $1.7 million, or 16.6 percent, from the $10.0 million generated during the 2015 third quarter.  

Net
interest income was $6.7 million, which is up $0.7 million from the prior year third quarter s $6.0 million. The Company s
earning assets increased $69.4 million, coupled with a 2 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets. The net interest
margin for the third quarter of 2016 was 3.82 percent compared to 3.87 percent for the third quarter of 2015. Funding cost for
interest bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2016 were 0.56 percent compared to 0.49 percent for the prior year third
quarter.  

Noninterest
income was $5.0 million for the 2016 third quarter, which is up $1.1 million from the prior year third quarter s $4.0 million.
In addition to the mortgage revenue detailed below, gains from the sale of non-mortgage loans was $0.3 million and gain on sale
of securities was $0.1 million. Noninterest income as a percentage of average assets for the third quarter of 2016 was 2.52 percent
compared to 2.20 percent for the prior year third quarter.  

State
Bank originated $117.2 million of mortgage loans for the third quarter of 2016, of which $101.1 million was sold with the remainder
in loans held for investment. This compares to $87.0 million for the third quarter of 2015, of which $70.1 million was sold with
the remainder in loans held for investment. These third quarter 2016 originations and subsequent sales resulted in $2.5 million
of gains, up 48 percent from the gains for the third quarter of 2015. Net mortgage banking revenue was $2.7 million for the third
quarter of 2016 compared to $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2015 due to the positive adjustment in servicing rights and
higher volume. The 2016 third quarter included an $0.1 million valuation recapture on our mortgage servicing rights, due to increased
prepayment speeds in the portfolio.  

Consolidated Noninterest Expense:
  Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $7.9 million, which is up $1.3 million compared to $6.6 million
in the prior-year third quarter. The increase in noninterest expenses compared to the prior year was the result of higher staffing
costs for our new branch facilities, merit increases, as well as additional staffing in compliance and mortgage administration. 

Income
Taxes:   Income taxes for the third quarter of 2016 were $1.2 million (effective rate 32.2 percent) compared to $1.0 million
(effective rate 31.4 percent) for the third quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by the increase in pretax income for the
Company.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Net
Income:   Net income for the first nine months of 2016 was $6.5 million compared to net income of $5.8 million for the first
nine months of 2015, an increase of 12 percent. Earnings per diluted share (EPS) for the period of $1.01 were up 13 percent from
the $0.89 for the prior year nine month period.  

Provision
for Loan Losses:   The provision for loan losses for the first nine months of 2016 was $0.25 million compared to $0.95 million
for the prior year first nine months. Net recoveries for the period were $0.08 million compared to net charge-offs of $0.65 million
for the prior year nine month period.  

Consolidated
Revenue :    Total revenue, consisting of net interest income and noninterest income, was $32.0 million for the first
nine months of 2016, an increase of $2.6 million, or 8.9 percent, from the $29.4 million generated during the 2015 first nine
months.  

Net
interest income was $19.2 million, which is up $1.8 million from the prior year first nine months $17.4 million. The Company s
earning assets increased $65.7 million, coupled with a 2 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets. The net interest
margin for the first nine months of 2016 was 3.77 percent compared to 3.78 percent for the first nine months of 2015. Funding
cost for interest bearing liabilities for the first nine months of 2016 were 0.54 percent compared to 0.49 percent for the prior
year first nine months.  

Noninterest
income was $12.8 million for the 2016 first nine months, which is up $0.8 million from the prior year first nine month s
$12.0 million. In addition to the mortgage revenue detailed below, gains from the sale of non-mortgage loans was $0.9 million
and gain on sale of securities was $0.3 million.  

State
Bank originated $299.4 million of mortgage loans for the first nine months of 2016, of which $255.57 million was sold with the
remainder in loans held for investment. These levels were up 17 and 19 percent respectively for the prior year first nine months.
The 2016 first nine months included a $1.2 million valuation impairment on our mortgage servicing rights, due to increased prepayment
speeds in the portfolio.  

Consolidated
Noninterest Expense:   Noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2016 was $22.2 million, which is up $2.1 million
compared to $20.1 million in the prior-year first nine months. The increase in noninterest expenses compared to the prior year
was the result of higher staffing costs for our new branch facilities and mortgage administration. In addition, higher occupancy
costs related to our new branch facilities in Dublin and Findlay, Ohio have been realized.  

Income
Taxes:   Income taxes for the first nine months of 2016 were $3.0 million (effective rate 31.8 percent) compared to $2.6
million (effective rate 30.9 percent) for the first nine months of 2015. This increase was driven by the increase in pretax income
for the Company.  

Changes
in Financial Condition    

Total
assets at September 30, 2016 were $801.8 million, an increase of $68.7 million or 9.4 percent since 2015 year end. Total loans,
net of unearned income, were $619.4 million as of September 30, 2016, up $61.7 million from year end, an increase of 11.1 percent.  

Total
deposits at September 30, 2016 were $662.1 million, an increase of $75.7 million or 12.9 percent since 2015 year end. Borrowed
funds (consisting of FHLB advances, and REPOs) totaled $34.4 million at September 30, 2016. This is down from year end when borrowed
funds totaled $47.4 million due to a decrease in FHLB advances of $12.0 million. Total equity for the Company of $86.3 million
now stands at 10.8 percent of total assets, which is up from the December 31, 2015 level of $81.2 million. Total equity to assets
was 11.1 percent at December 31, 2015.  

The
allowance for loan loss of $7.3 million is up from the 2015 year end by 4.7 percent. This increase combined with the loan growth
of 11.1 percent results in an allowance to loans of 1.18 percent. The 1.18 percent level is considered appropriate by management
given the risk profile of the portfolio. The allowance to loan loss level at September 30, 2015 was 1.34 percent. The decline
from the prior year was due to higher loan growth and improved asset quality.  

Capital
Resources    

As
of September 30, 2016, based on the computations for the call report the Bank is classified as well capitalized under the regulatory
framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain capital ratios as set forth
in the table below. There are no conditions or events since September 30, 2016 that management believes have changed the Bank s
capital classification.  

The
Bank s actual capital levels and ratios as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are presented in the following table.
Capital levels are presented for the Bank only as the Company is now exempt from quarterly reporting on capital levels at the
holding company level ($ s in thousands):  

Effective
January 1, 2015 new regulatory capital requirements, commonly referred to as  Basel III  were implemented and are
reflected in the September 30, 2016 capital table above. Management opted out of the accumulated other comprehensive income treatment
under the new requirements and, as such unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale securities will continue to be excluded
from Bank regulatory capital.  

LIQUIDITY    

Liquidity
relates primarily to the Company s ability to fund loan demand, meet deposit customers  withdrawal requirements and
provide for operating expenses. Assets used to satisfy these needs consist of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-earning
deposits in other financial institutions, securities available-for-sale and loans held for sale. These assets are commonly referred
to as liquid assets. Liquid assets were $123.7 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $117.8 million at December 31, 2015.  

Liquidity
risk arises from the possibility that the Company may not be able to meet the Company s financial obligations and operating
cash needs or may become overly reliant upon external funding sources. In order to manage this risk, the Board of Directors of
the Company has established a Liquidity Policy that identifies primary sources of liquidity, establishes procedures for monitoring
and measuring liquidity and quantifies minimum liquidity requirements. This policy designates the Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO )
as the body responsible for meeting these objectives. The ALCO reviews liquidity regularly and evaluates significant changes in
strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions. Liquidity is centrally managed on a daily basis by the Company s
Chief Financial Officer and Asset Liability Manager.  

The
Company s commercial real estate, first mortgage residential, agricultural and multi-family mortgage portfolio of $462.8
million at September 30, 2016 and $416.8 million at December 31, 2015, which can and has been used to collateralize borrowings,
is an additional source of liquidity. Management believes the Company s current liquidity level, without these borrowings,
is sufficient to meet its liquidity needs. At September 30, 2016, all eligible commercial real estate, first mortgage residential
and multi-family mortgage loans were pledged under an FHLB blanket lien.  

The
cash flow statements for the periods presented provide an indication of the Company s sources and uses of cash, as well
as an indication of the ability of the Company to maintain an adequate level of liquidity. A discussion of the cash flow statements
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows.  

The
Company experienced positive cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015. Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $5.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Highlights for the current year include $249.2 million in proceeds from the sale
of loans, which is up $25.1 million from the prior year. Originations of loans held for sale was a use of cash of $241.7 million,
which is also up from the prior year, by $24.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was a gain on sale
of loans of $7.1 million, and depreciation and amortization of $0.9 million.  

The
Company experienced negative cash flows from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015. Net cash flows used in investing activities was $64.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $40.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Highlights for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include $17.6 million in
purchases of available-for-sale securities. These cash payments were offset by $11.9 million in proceeds from maturities and sales
of securities, which is down $2.9 million from the prior year nine-month period. The Company experienced a $61.9 million increase
in loans, which is up $36.7 million from the prior year nine-month period.  

The
Company experienced positive cash flows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30,
2015. Net cash flow provided by financing activities was $60.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $25.4
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Highlights for the current period include a $41.1 million increase in transaction
deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which is up from the $27.0 million increase for the prior year nine-month
period. Certificates of deposit increased by $34.6 million in the current year compared to a decrease of $4.4 million for the
prior year.  

ALCO
uses an economic value of equity ( EVE ) analysis to measure risk in the balance sheet incorporating all cash flows
over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet positions. The EVE analysis calculates the net present value of the Company s
assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from -400 basis points to +400 basis points. The likelihood of a
decrease in rates as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was considered unlikely given the current interest rate environment
and therefore, only the minus 100 basis point rate change was included in this analysis. The results of this analysis are reflected
in the following tables for September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Off-Balance-Sheet
Borrowing Arrangements:    

Significant
additional off-balance-sheet liquidity is available in the form of FHLB advances and unused federal funds lines from correspondent
banks. Management expects the risk of changes in off-balance-sheet arrangements to be immaterial to earnings.  

The
Company s commercial real estate, first mortgage residential, agricultural and multi-family mortgage portfolios in the aggregate
amount of $462.8 million have been pledged to meet FHLB collateralization requirements as of September 30, 2016. Based on the
current collateralization requirements of the FHLB, the Company had approximately $51.4 million of additional borrowing capacity
at September 30, 2016. The Company also had $15.9 million in unpledged securities that may be used to pledge for additional borrowings.  

The
Company s contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 were comprised of long-term debt obligations, other debt obligations,
operating lease obligations and other long-term liabilities. Long-term debt obligations are comprised of FHLB Advances of $23.0
million, and Trust Preferred Securities of $11.4 million. Total time deposits at September 30, 2016 were $193.7 million, of which
$107.1 million matures beyond one year.  

Also,
as of September 30, 2016, the Company had commitments to sell mortgage loans totaling $26.9 million. The Company believes that
it has adequate resources to fund commitments as they arise and that it can adjust the rate on savings certificates to retain
deposits in changing interest rate environments. If the Company requires funds beyond its internal funding capabilities, advances
from the FHLB of Cincinnati and other financial institutions are available.  

ASSET
LIABILITY MANAGEMENT    

Asset
liability management  involves developing, executing and monitoring strategies to maintain appropriate liquidity, maximize
net interest income and minimize the impact that significant fluctuations in market interest rates would have on current and future
earnings. The business of the Company and the composition of its balance sheet consist of investments in interest-earning assets
(primarily loans, mortgage-backed securities, and securities available for sale) which are primarily funded by interest-bearing
liabilities (deposits and borrowings). With the exception of specific loans which are originated and held for sale, all of the
financial instruments of the Company are for other than trading purposes. All of the Company s transactions are denominated
in U.S. dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure. In addition, the Company has limited exposure to commodity prices
related to agricultural loans. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices on interest rates are assumed
to be insignificant. The Company s financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest
rates resulting in market risk. Interest rate risk is the Company s primary market risk exposure; to a lesser extent, liquidity
risk also impacts market risk exposure.  

Interest
rate risk  is the exposure of a banking institution s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates. Accepting
this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value; however, excessive levels of interest rate risk could
pose a significant threat to the Company s earnings and capital base. Accordingly, effective risk management that maintains
interest rate risks at prudent levels is essential to the Company s safety and soundness.  

Evaluating
a financial institution s exposure  to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the management
process used to control interest rate risk and the organization s quantitative level of exposure. When assessing the interest
rate risk management process, the Company seeks to ensure that appropriate policies, procedures, management information systems
and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risks at prudent levels of consistency and continuity. Evaluating
the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires the Company to assess the existing and potential future effects
of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition, including capital adequacy, earnings, liquidity and asset
quality (when appropriate).  

The
Federal Reserve Board  together with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Company
adopted a Joint Agency Policy Statement on interest rate risk effective June 26, 1996. The policy statement provides guidance
to examiners and bankers on sound practices for managing interest rate risk, which will form the basis for ongoing evaluation
of the adequacy of interest rate risk management at supervised institutions. The policy statement also outlines fundamental elements
of sound management that have been identified in prior Federal Reserve guidance and discusses the importance of these elements
in the context of managing interest rate risk. Specifically, the guidance emphasizes the need for active board of director and
senior management oversight and a comprehensive risk management process that effectively identifies, measures and controls interest
rate risk.  

Financial
institutions  derive their income primarily from the excess of interest collected over interest paid. The rates of interest
an institution earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Since
market interest rates change over time, an institution is exposed to lower profit margins (or losses) if it cannot adapt to interest
rate changes. For example, assume that an institution s assets carry intermediate or long-term fixed rates and that those
assets are funded with short-term liabilities. If market interest rates rise by the time the short-term liabilities must be refinanced,
the increase in the institution s interest expense on its liabilities may not be sufficiently offset if assets continue
to earn at the long-term fixed rates. Accordingly, an institution s profits could decrease on existing assets because the
institution will either have lower net interest income or possibly, net interest expense. Similar risks exist when assets are
subject to contractual interest rate ceilings, or rate-sensitive assets are funded by longer-term, fixed-rate liabilities in a
declining rate environment.  

There
are several ways  an institution can manage interest rate risk including: 1) matching repricing periods for new assets and
liabilities, for example, by shortening or lengthening terms of new loans, investments, or liabilities; 2) selling existing assets
or repaying certain liabilities; and 3) hedging existing assets, liabilities, or anticipated transactions. An institution might
also invest in more complex financial instruments intended to hedge or otherwise change interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps,
futures contracts, options on futures contracts, and other such derivative financial instruments can be used for this purpose.
Because these instruments are sensitive to interest rate changes, they require management s expertise to be effective. The
Company does not currently utilize any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. As market conditions warrant,
the Company may implement various interest rate risk management strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

With
the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and the Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial officer) of the Company, the Company s management has evaluated the

                                         reports which the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act would be accumulated
                                         and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive
                                         officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
                                         required disclosure;    

information
                                         required to be disclosed by the Company in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other
                                         reports which the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act would be recorded,
                                         processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
                                         rules and forms; and    

the
                                         Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
                                         quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.     

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) that occurred during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
