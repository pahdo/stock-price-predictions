NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

(Unaudited)

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

Petrolia Energy Corporation ( we ,  us ,  Petrolia  and the  Company ) an oil and gas exploration, development, and production company.  The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s latest Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year, 2015, as reported in Form 10-K, have been omitted.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Askarii Resources, LLC ( Askarii ) and SUDS Properties LLC (acquired on September 28, 2016. Our subsidiary, Askarii, operates in the oil field services industry, providing equipment and services to various oil field related companies. All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Since the single subsidiary is wholly-owned, all non intercompany balances are included in the consolidated financial statement balances. 

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements follows.

Management Estimates   -  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Inventories   -  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are valued using the specific identification method. Inventories include pump jacks, vehicles and other oil field support equipment.  The Company performs a periodic review of the inventory and if it is determined that any has become obsolete, an inventory reserve is recorded.

Intangible Assets   - Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value.  

Equipment sales   -  Revenues from the sale of oil and gas related equipment are recognized at the time of sale,  when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and the recovery of the consideration is probable. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements through the filing date and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company.

(Unaudited)

NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN

The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company plans to generate profits by reworking its existing oil or gas wells and drilling additional wells, as needed.  The Company will need to raise funds through either the sale of its securities, issuance of corporate bonds, joint venture agreements and/or bank financing to accomplish its goals.    The Company does not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide the Company with any additional capital, at this time.   If additional financing is not available when needed, the Company may need to cease operations.   The Company may not be successful in raising the capital needed to drill and/or rework existing oil wells.  Any additional wells that the Company may drill may be non-productive.  Management believes that actions presently being taken to secure additional funding for the reworking of its existing infrastructure will provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.  Since the Company has an oil producing asset, its goal is to increase the production rate by optimizing its current infrastructure.    The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern; no adjustments to the financial statements have been made to account for this uncertainty. 

NOTE 4. NOTES PAYABLE   RELATED PARTY

On June 30, 2016, the maturity date of the $350,000 and $200,000 Convertible Secured Promissory Notes (the  Notes ) between the Company and Rick Wilber ( Holder ) were extended to December 31, 2016. If at any time prior to December 31, 2016, the Company pays the Holder $500,000 on the Notes (together with all accrued interest), the Company will receive a $50,000 discount on the total principal amount of $550,000 outstanding under the Notes. If the Notes are fully paid by the Company, the Company will issue new warrants for the purchase of 500,000 shares of stock at an exercise price of $0.15 per share that will expire five (5) years from the grant date (and the old warrants will be extinguished). If payment is not made before December 31, 2016, no discount is allowed.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company amortized $171,573 and $103,520, respectively, of debt discount to interest expense. At September 30, 2016 the remaining unamortized debt discount is $0.

Purchase and Sale Agreement

With an effective date of September 28 2016, the Company acquired an additional 50% net working interest (bringing the Company s interest to 60%) in the Slick Unit Dutcher Sands field ( SUDS ) located in Creek County Oklahoma, based on a Purchase and Sale Agreement between the Company and Jovian Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries, Jovian Resources, LLC. and SUDS Properties, LLC (together known as  Jovian ).  The largest interest owner of Jovian is Zel C. Khan, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Director, and our Director Quinten Beasley who is the President of Jovian.

The Company issued two notes for a combined value of $4,000,000 in exchange for a cumulative 50% working interest in SUDS.  One note is a Promissory Note for $1,000,000 bearing interest at 5% per annum and is due on December 31, 2016.  If full payment is not made by December 31, 2016, we are entitled to extend the Note to March 31, 2017 by making a $10,000 payment in cash prior to maturity.  The Promissory Note is secured by a 12.5% undivided working interest in the SUDS field.  Although the note is due on December 31, 2016, in the event the Company closes a financing related to the SUDS field, 50% of the net proceeds received from the financing will be applied to reduce the Note.  The second note is a Production Payment Note for $3,000,000 paid out of twenty percent (20%) of the 50% undivided interest of net revenues received in the purchase which  are attributable to the SUDS field assets.  We are required to make the production payments to seller no later than the end of each calendar month.  The Production Payment Note is secured by a 37.5% undivided working interest in the SUDS field. For additional details on the acquisition of property see Note 8.

Common Stock  

On February 1, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares in Askarii Resources, a private Texas based oil   gas service company. The Company acquired Askarii by issuing one million restricted common shares.

The final purchase price allocation is as follows: trademarks $10,000, internet/website $5,000, customer lists $10,000 and customer relationships $25,000.

On February 10, 2016, a shareholder provided an advance of $20,000 in order to temporarily fund the Company s working capital needs.  On April 1, 2016, in order to compensate the shareholder, the Company issued 285,714 shares in consideration for forgiveness of the debt in full.

On March 11, 2016, the Board of Directors granted three (3) contract employees 700,000 shares of the Company s restricted common stock for settlement of outstanding payables. The shares were issued at the current market price of $0.06 per share on March 11, 2016, at an aggregate value of $42,000.

As a result of the 2015 Annual Meeting of our Stockholders, held on April14, 2016, the shareholders voted to increase the total number of authorized shares of common stock to 150,000,000.

On May 2, 2016, the Company paid off its outstanding Promissory Note to Blue Sky NM ( BSNM ) for $146,875.

Based on the market value of the stock on May 2, 2016 of $0.10, the value of the transaction was $146,875 and resulted in no gain or loss.  In addition, a cash payment of $4,869 was made to pay off the remaining outstanding interest.

During the nine  months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed $25,500 of stock based compensation (for its CEO) related to restricted stock awards. The remaining value to be expensed on these awards is $34,000 at September 30, 2016

On September 1, 2016, the Company issued 3.5 million shares of its restricted common stock to Whistler to acquire an additional 25% working interest ownership of TSLAU.  For additional details on the acquisition see Note 8.

Warrants

Summary information regarding common stock warrants granted and outstanding as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is as follows:

NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company, as a lessee of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the Company for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the Company to liability for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area.  The Company is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of September 30, 2016, which have not been provided for, or covered by insurance or which may have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change, or past noncompliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Company s properties.

Office Lease    As of September 30, 2016, the Company has one annually renewable office lease in Houston at a cost of $1,650 per month.

NOTE 7. RELATED PARTY

Transactions with related parties and affiliates

Beginning February 1, 2016, the Company sponsored the SUDS 1% Term Overriding Royalty Interest ( ORRI ) offering on behalf of the SUDS field to raise $300,000. Under the terms of the Company offering, investors received 1% of the gross revenue from the field monthly, based on their investment of $20,000 until such time as they receive a cumulative revenue amount of $30,000. With each unit purchased, a warrant to purchase 10,000 shares of Company s common stock was granted with an exercise price of $0.10 per share, and an expiration date of February 28, 2019. At the end of the second quarter, the $300,000 offering had been received which resulted in the granting of warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock. The following affiliated investors each purchased one (1) unit: Joel Oppenheim, Zel C Khan, Lee Lytton, Paul Deputy and Leo Womack. The fair value of all these SUDS related warrants was $14,336 based on a $0.06 per share valuation, volatility of 235%, a discount rate of 1.09%, over a 3 year term. In addition, to properly account for the Company s 10% working interest owner in the SUDS field, $30,000 was offset against the full cost pool of Oil   Gas Properties.

The Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary Askarii sold pump jacks to the other owners of the SUDS properties (before the September acquisition), totaling $198,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  For the nine months ended, Askarii booked a profit of $164,670 on the sale of  pump jacks to the other owners of the SUDs properties.

To compensate the independent Directors for their service during 2016, on March 11, 2016, the Board of Directors granted Leo B. Womack, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company an option to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.06 per share, which vests immediately, and is exercisable for 36 months thereafter. The Board also granted Lee Lytton and Joel Oppenheim, members of the Board of Directors each an option to purchase 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.06 per share, which vest immediately, and are exercisable for 36 months thereafter. The fair value of the options granted on March 11, 2016 is $115,045 and was based on a $0.06 valuation, volatility of 235%, a discount rate of 1.09% and a 3 year term. The total amount of the options was expensed in 2016. These warrants are subject to a clawback provision which would be ratably invoked if a director did not complete his 2016 service term.

Effective April 18, 2016, Quinten Beasley was compensated for his service during 2016 through a grant of 500,000 warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.06 per share, which vests immediately, and is exercisable for 36 months thereafter.

These warrants are subject to a clawback provision which would be ratably invoked if a director did not complete his 2016 service term.

On May 31, 2016, in consideration for the cancellation of debt incurred as a result of a $48,000 advance, the Company issued 8 units or 800,000 shares to the current CFO as part of, and under the terms of, the September 1, 2015 private offering.  The shares were issued at a price of $0.06 per share and included warrants to purchase an additional 800,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.10 cents per share at any time prior to August 5, 2018.  This represented the final sale under this offering.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, shareholders advanced an additional $378,000, while also receiving offsetting cash payments of $122,000 on outstanding advances and converting $150,000 of advances into shares of common stock, as described in Note 5. This resulted in a cumulative increase of $116,000 in borrowings through shareholders. This increased the shareholder advance liability from $46,000 at December 31, 2015 to $162,000 at September 30, 2016 which is included under Note payable to affiliates.  . In connection with these loans the Company granted 290,000 warrants to purchase 290,000 shares of common stock at an average exercise price of $0.09 per share. The fair value of these warrants was $19,536, based on an average $0.08 price per share valuation, volatility of 284%, a discount rate of 0.87% and a 3 year term.  The value of the warrants was recorded as debt issuance costs on the date of issuance.

On November 4, 2015 the Company executed a Promissory Note for $146,875 to BSNM, related to the TLSAU acquisition. The note was due on December 31, 2015 and accrues at a rate of 10% per annum.  The repayment of the note is secured by 1,000,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company. The Company exercised its one time right for a 6 month extension of the maturity date of the note by issuing BSNM 500,000 additional shares of restricted Company common stock on December 31, 2015. On May 2, 2016, this note was converted into 500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.075 per share at a value of $37,500.

On June 24, 2016, the Company purchased a 2007 Toyota Tundra vehicle for $10,625 from Jovian Petroleum Corporation.  It is being used for field operations.  During July 2016, payments of $7,000 were made against the outstanding balance.  There was no promissory note created for the remaining outstanding balance of $3,264, and both parties agreed for the balance to be paid when funds become available.  The truck s estimated useful life is 5 years.

In association with Mr. Zel C. Khan s employment agreement dated September 23, 2015, the Company issued one warrant to purchase one share of the Company s restricted stock at an exercise price of $0.20 per share for each dollar of Mr. Khan s deferred gross salary for the nine months ended 2016. Mr. Khan s total accrued salary at September 30, 2016 was $120,000.  The Company granted warrants to purchase 120,000 shares of common shares for the nine months ended 2016 (40,000 warrants per quarter). The warrants have a term of 36 months from their issuance date. The fair value of all three quarter s warrants was $11,376, based on an average $0.10 price per share valuation, volatility of 235%, a discount rate of 1.09% and a 3 year term.  The warrants were recognized as stock compensation expense.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, two directors were granted warrants to purchase 31,250 shares of common stock in exchange for providing collateral to a bank to collateralize the Company s letters of credit.  The value of the warrants was $2,629 with an exercise price of each warrant is $0.06 per share and they expire three (3) years from their grant date.  The value of these warrants was recorded as debt issuance costs on the date of the grant.

On August 17, 2016 Paul M. Deputy was appointed Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) of the Company and entered into an employment agreement with the Company effective July 1, 2016 to serve as Chief Financial Officer for an initial term of twelve (12) months (automatically renewable thereafter for additional one year terms).  The agreement provides that the Company will pay Mr. Deputy $140,000 per year.  The Company granted Mr. Deputy options to purchase 550,000 shares of the Company s restricted common stock at a value of $26,096 with an exercise price of $0.077 per share with  a term of three (3) years beginning July 1, 2016, as a signing bonus.

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Background

We were incorporated in Colorado on January 16, 2002.

We planned to sell custom framed artwork, art accessories, and interior design consulting. However, we generated only limited revenue since inception and have been inactive since 2008.

In February 2012 we decided it would be in the best interests of our shareholders to no longer pursue our original business plan and, in April 2012 we became active in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties.

Effective September 2, 2016, we formally changed our name to Petrolia Energy Corporation, pursuant to the filing of a Statement of Conversion with the Secretary of State of Colorado and a Certificate of Conversion with the Secretary of State of Texas, authorized by the Plan of Conversion which was approved by our stockholders at our April 14, 2016, annual meeting of stockholders, each of which are described in greater detail in the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2016. In addition to the Certificate of Conversion filing, we filed a Certificate of Correction filing with the Secretary of State of Texas (correcting certain errors in our originally filed Certificate of Formation) on August 24, 2016.

As previously reported, although the stockholders approved the Plan of Conversion at the annual meeting, pursuant to which our corporate jurisdiction was to be changed from the State of Colorado to the State of Texas by means of a process called a  Conversion  and our name was to be changed to  Petrolia Energy Corporation , those filings were not immediately made and the Conversion did not become legally effective until September 2, 2016. Specifically, on June 15, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Conversion with the Texas Secretary of State, affecting the Conversion and the name change, and including a Certificate of Formation as a converted Texas corporation; however, the Statement of Conversion was not filed with the State of Colorado until a later date. As a result, and because FINRA and the Depository Trust Company (DTC) had advised us that they would not recognize the Conversion or name change, or update such related information in the marketplace, until we became current in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and they had a chance to review and approve such transactions, we took the position that the Conversion and name change were not legally effective until September 2, 2016.

As a result of the filings described above, and FINRA and the Depository Trust Company (DTC) formally recognizing and reflecting the events described above in the marketplace, the Company has formally converted from a Colorado corporation to a Texas corporation, and has formally changed its name to  Petrolia Energy Corporation .

While the Company s name has officially changed, the Company s trading symbol on the OTC Pink trading market will remain  BBLS . Additionally, the CUSIP number relating to the Company s common stock will change to 71668V 105.

Plan of Operations

Since 2015, we have established a clearly defined strategy to acquire, enhance and redevelop high-quality, resource in place assets. Focused on acquisitions in the southwest United States while actively pursuing our strategy to offer low-cost operational solutions in established Oil and Gas regions. We believe our mix of assets-oil-in-place conventional plays, low-risk resource plays and the redevelopment of our late-stage plays is a solid foundation for continued growth and future revenue growth.

Our strategy is to acquire low risk, conventionally producing oil fields. This strategy allows us to incorporate new technology to minimize risk and maximize the recoverability of existing reservoirs. This approach allows us to minimize the environmental impact caused by exploratory development.

Our activities will primarily be dependent upon available financing.

Oil and gas leases are considered real property.  Title to properties which we may acquire will be subject to landowner s royalties, overriding royalties, carried working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, to liens for current taxes not yet due, liens for amounts owing to persons operating wells, and other encumbrances.  As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties little investigation of record title will be made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records).  However, drilling title opinions may be obtained before commencement of drilling operations.

Minerva-Rockdale Field

The Minerva-Rockdale Field, which is located approximately 30 miles Northeast of Austin, Texas, was first discovered in 1921 and is approximately 50 square miles in size. The main producing formation for this field is the Upper Cretaceous Navarro Group of sands and shale s. The Navarro is typically subdivided into several producing zones from the uppermost  A  and  B  sands to the lower  C  and  D  sands. The  B  sand is the primary producing zone. These sands are commonly fine grained and poorly sorted and were deposited close to a shoreline during a cycle of marine regression.

In April 2013, the Company entered into a lease pertaining to a 423 acre tract in Milam County, Texas, which is adjacent to the Company s original 200 acre lease.  The Company issued 500,000 shares of its common stock as consideration for a 100% working interest (75% net revenue interest) in such lease.

In August 2013, we became an oil and gas operator and took over the operation of 100% of our wells.  As such, we terminated our relationship with RTO Operating, LLC for the day-to-day operations and monitoring of our wells. During 2014, the Company continued to operate its own lease. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company hired Jovian Petroleum Corporation (Jovian) to survey the operations and well performance at the Noack field. Their report identified paraffin buildup problems in the well bores and gathering lines as the main production issue for the Company to overcome. In December 2014, the Company signed an operating agreement with Jovian to assume full operational responsibility for the Noack field under a fixed fee agreement of $10,000 per month for full operating field services. On March 1, 2015, the Company hired Zel C. Khan, our current CEO and director, who is the largest stockholder of Jovian, as well as several former employees of Jovian Petroleum. This allowed for the fixed fee agreement with Jovian to end.

During the period from our inception to December 31, 2011, we did not drill any oil or gas wells.  During the year-ended December 31, 2012 we drilled and completed six (6) oil wells and during 2013 the Company drilled and completed three (3) wells of which one (1) was converted to an injection well. During 2014 the Company drilled seven (7) new wells. Six (6) of the wells were completed, five (5) wells produced, one (1) did not produce and one (1) well was not completed. During 2015, the Company had fourteen (14) wells producing with one (1) injection well and one (1) well remaining offline.

Also, one of the existing non-producing wells was worked over and was converted to a producing well in 2014.

Slick Unit Dutcher Sands ( SUDS ) Field

The SUDS oilfield consists of 2,600 acres located in Creek County, Oklahoma and carries a 7.8% net revenue interest (NRI). The first oil producer was completed in 1918 by Standard Oil of Ohio ( Sohio ), which at that time was owned by John D. Rockefeller. By 1959, approximately 14,000,000 barrels of oil had been recovered at an average well depth of 3,100 feet and over 100 wells in production. Through a series of events, the infrastructure had deteriorated and the field suffered a lot of neglect. Since 2011, Jovian has invested an estimated $1.6 million into the restoration of the field; rebuilding the infrastructure and putting wells back in production. To date, 18 wells have been worked over and 9 are fully operational with considerable reserves remaining.

Table of Contents 

The Company acquired a 10% working interest in the SUDS field on September 23, 2015, in exchange for 10,586,805 shares of restricted common stock. Based on the then current market value of our common stock, $0.068 per share, the price paid was $719,903 or $4.77 dollars per barrel of oil (Bbl). Through this transaction, the Company increased its reserve base by approximately 151,000 Bbls of (1P) proven reserves. Concurrently with the purchase, Jovian agreed to assign to the Company all rights to be the operator of the SUDS unit under a standard operating agreement.

With an effective date of September 28 2016, the Company acquired an additional 50% net working interest in SUDS, based on a Purchase and Sale Agreement between the Company and Jovian Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries, Jovian Resources, LLC. and SUDS Properties, LLC (together known as  Jovian ).

Purchase and Sale Agreement

The Company issued two notes for a combined value of $4,000,000 in exchange for a cumulative 50% working interest in SUDS.  One note is a Promissory Note for $1,000,000 bearing interest at 5% and due on December 31, 2016.  If full payment is not made by December 31, 2016, the buyer will be entitled to extend the Note to March 31, 2017 by making a $10,000 payment in cash prior to maturity.  The Promissory Note is secured by a 12.5% undivided working interest in the SUDS field.  Although the note is due on December 31, 2016, in the event the Company closes and financing related to the SUDS field, 50% of the net proceeds received from the financing will be applied to pay on the Note.  The second note is a Production Payment Note for $3,000,000 paid out of twenty percent (20%) of the 50% undivided interest of net revenues received by the Purchaser that are attributable to the SUDS field assets.  The Purchaser shall make the production payments to seller no later than the end of each calendar month.  The Production Payment Note is secured by a 37.5% undivided working interest in the SUDS field.

With an effective date of September 28 2016, the Company acquired an additional 40% net working interest (bringing the Company s interest to 50%) in the SUDS field and 100% of SUDS Properties LLC, based on two separate agreements, a Share Exchange Agreement and a Purchase and Sale Agreement, both between the Company and Jovian.

Share Exchange Agreement

The Company issued 24,308,985 shares of its restricted common stock to Jovian to acquire a 100% of the outstanding securities of SUDS Properties LLC, effective on September 28, 2016 pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement. The purchase price of the shares equates to a $4,373,186 value, based on the $0.1799 per share market price of Petrolia s shares on September 28, 2016 (the effective date of the transaction).

Twin Lakes San Andres Unit ( TLSAU ) Field

TLSAU is 45 miles from Roswell, Chavez County, New Mexico and consists of 4,864 acres with 130 wells. The last independent reserve report prepared by MKM Engineering on December 31, 2015, reflects approximately 3.4 million barrels of proven oil reserves remaining for the 100% working interest.

On November 4, 2015, the Company acquired a 15% net working interest in the TLSAU field (the  Net Working Interest ) and all operating equipment on the field. Through this transaction, the Company increased its reserve base by approximately 384,800 Bbls of (1P) proven reserves. The Company was assigned all rights to be the operator of the TLSAU field under a standard operating agreement. The total purchase price for the acquisition of the Net Working Interest and equipment rights was $196,875 or $0.52 dollars per barrel of oil (Bbl) and was paid to Blue Sky NM, Inc ( BSNM ). The Company paid $50,000 in cash and gave BSNM a promissory note in the amount of $146,875. The $50,000 was paid by the CEO for the benefit of the Company and recorded as a shareholder advance. On November 5, 2015, the $50,000 advance was converted to 800,000 shares at $0.06 per share which included 800,000 warrants. In addition, a $1.3 million face value BSNM note was purchased for $316,800 (6,000,000 shares or 0.0528 per share). With the inclusion of the note, the price per barrel would be $1.33 dollars per barrel of oil (Bbl).

The Company issued 3.5 million shares of its restricted common stock to Whistler to acquire an additional 25% working interest ownership of TSLAU. The purchase price of the shares equates to a $350,000 value, based on the $0.10 per share market price of Petrolia s shares on September 1, 2016 (the effective date of the transaction).

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has sixteen wells drilled and completed, of which thirteen wells are currently online and producing at a rate of approximately 30 bbls of oil and 64bbls of water per day.

Overview of Cash Flow Activities:

Net cash (used by) operating activities was ($315,048) and ($290,270) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change was due primarily to the recognition of a $668,073 impairment in 2015 and a relative decrease in accounts receivable. This was partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities.

Net cash (used by) investing activities was ($63,362) and ($15,329) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was due to the purchase of a pulling rig.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $387,390 and $289,362 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase from 2015 to 2016 was due to increased shareholder advances and short term loans.  These sources were offset by payments on previously outstanding shareholders advances.

As of September 30, 2016, we had total current assets of $325,516 and total assets in the amount of $13,127,778. Our total current liabilities as of September 30, 2016 were $2,573,956. We had negative working capital of $2,248,440 as of September 30, 2016. Our material asset balances are made up of oil   gas properties and related equipment. Our most significant liabilities include a related party notes, asset retirement obligation (ARO) and accruals for professional services. One related party note ($550,000) is with Rick Wilber (see Note 4 of the financial statements included herein for further details).

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company raised $780,000 through the sale of 2,600,111 shares to investors as part of a private placement, detailed on Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2014. The shares were all purchased at a price of $0.30 per share and included warrants. The purchasers included David Baker and Leo Womack both of whom were Directors at the time.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we raised $140,000 through a private placement offering with warrants authorized by the Board on March 23, 2015. We also raised $162,000 through a private placement offering with warrants, as reported on Form 8-K filed November 9, 2015.

From January 1, 2016 to the date of this filing we raised an additional $48,000 cash through the sale of 8 units, each with a price of $6,000 per unit, each consisting of 100,000 shares of stock and warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock.  This represented the final sale under this offering.

With an effective date of September 28 2016, the Company acquired an additional 50% net working interest in SUDS (bringing the Company s interest to 60%) in the SUDS field from Jovian.  The Company issued two notes for a combined value of $4,000,000 in exchange for a cumulative 50% working interest in SUDS.  One note is a Promissory Note for $1,000,000 bearing interest at 5% and due on December 31, 2016.  If full payment is not made by December 31, 2016, the buyer will be entitled to extend the Note to March 31, 2017 by making a $10,000 payment in cash prior to maturity.  The Promissory Note is secured by a 12.5% undivided working interest in the SUDS field.  Although the note is due on December 31, 2016, in the event the Company closes and financing related to the SUDS field, 50% of the net proceeds received from the financing will be applied to pay on the Note.  The second note is a Production Payment Note for $3,000,000 paid out of twenty percent (20%) of the 50% undivided interest of net revenues received by the Purchaser that are attributable to the SUDS field assets.  The Purchaser shall make the production payments to seller no later than the end of each calendar month.  The Production Payment Note is secured by a 37.5% undivided working interest in the SUDS field.  The notes are included on the balance sheet under note payable to affiliates   current portion and long term.  The largest interest owner of Jovian is Zel C. Khan, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Director.  Mr. Quinten Beasley is the President of Jovian.

The Company continues to operate at a negative cash flow of approximately $50,000 per month and our auditors have raised a going concern issue in their latest audit report. Management is pursuing several initiatives to secure funding to increase production at both the SUDS and Twin Lakes fields which together with an increase in the price of crude oil may allow the Company to become cash flow positive, funding permitting, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The total amount required by the Company to accomplish this objective is approximately $250,000, however, in the event we are unable to raise additional funding, these initiatives may not actually occur.

The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. We plan to generate profits by drilling productive oil or gas wells. However, we will need to raise additional funds to drill new wells through the sale of our securities, through loans from third parties or from third parties willing to pay our share of drilling and completing the wells. We do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any additional capital. If additional financing is not available when needed, we may need to cease operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the capital needed to drill oil or gas wells nor that any such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any wells which we may drill may not be productive of oil or gas. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern; no adjustments to the financial statements have been made to account for this uncertainty.
