Note
1. The Company     

On
October 4, 2013, Healthient, Inc. ( the Company ) changed its name to SnackHealthy, Inc. and dissolved its sole wholly-owned
subsidiary SnackHealthy, Inc., a Nevada corporation. As of June 26, 2015, a majority of the shareholders of the Company representing
not less than 9,327,859 shares of common stock (82.83%) consented in writing to change the Company s name to Amaize Beverage
Corporation. Such approval and consent constitute the approval and consent of a majority of the total number of shares of outstanding
common stock and are sufficient under the Nevada General Corporation Law and the Company s Bylaws to approve the above action.
On August 13, 2015, Amaize Beverage Corporation, previously known as SnackHealthy, Inc., a Nevada corporation filed an amendment
to its articles of incorporation (the  Amendment ) with the Secretary of State of the state of Nevada. The Amendment
provided for the change of the Company s name from SnackHealthy, Inc., to Amaize Beverage Corporation. The name change and
the change of the Company s trading symbol were subsequently declared effective by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
as of August 19, 2015.  

The
Company has developed a healthy beverage product line containing a unique strain of purple corn which is high in antioxidant value.
The beverages are all natural, low calorie, gluten free, and non-GMO. The Company plans to distribute and sell the beverages through
large retailers and club stores in the United States.  

Note.
2 Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Presentation   

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company s year-end is June 30.  

Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.  

Financial
Instruments   

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, and amounts due to related parties, as reported in the accompanying balance sheets, approximates fair value due to the
short-term nature of these financial instruments.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, which is three
to seven years.  

Website
Development Costs   

The
Company has adopted the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 350  Intangible-Goodwill and Other.  Costs
incurred in the planning state of websites are expensed, while costs incurred in the development stage are capitalized and amortized
over the estimated three-year life of the asset. All website development costs have been fully amortized at September 30, 2016.  

Other
Assets   

Our
drink license was amortized over three years and is fully amortized at September 30, 2016.  

Long-Lived
Assets   

In
accordance with ASC 350, the Company regularly reviews the carrying value of intangible and other long-lived assets for the existence
of facts or circumstances, both internally and externally, that may suggest impairment. If impairment testing indicates a lack
of recoverability, an impairment loss is recognized by the Company if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair
value.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ) Income Taxes. Under ASC
740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenue
is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped,
which is when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and collectability of the amount is reasonably assured. Specifically,
revenue is recognized when products are shipped, which is when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The Company classifies
selling discounts and rebates, if any, as a reduction of revenue.  

Advertising
Costs   

The
Company s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred no advertising expenses
during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

In
December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation .
Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based
compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period
during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted
share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost
is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting
periods of the option grant. The Company applies this statement prospectively.  

Equity
instruments ( instruments ) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments,
as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505,  Equity Based
Payments to Non-Employees  defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement
date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance
is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based
on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share   

Net
loss per common share is computed pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 260,  Earnings per Share . Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed in the same way as for basic net loss.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
amounts previously presented for prior year have been reclassified. The reclassifications had no effect on net loss, total assets,
or stockholders  deficit.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.  

Note
3. Going Concern    

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern which assumes the Company will
be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company
incurred a net loss of $24,509 for the period ended September 30, 2016 and accumulated losses of $53,133,704 since inception to
September 30, 2016. Cash used in operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 was $4,703 and as of September 30, 2016, we
had a working capital deficit of $606,515. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital
and implement its business plan.  

Management
believes that the actions presently being taken and the success of future operations will be sufficient to enable the Company
to continue as a going concern, however, there can be no assurance that the raising of equity will be successful or that the Company
will be able to achieve profitability. Failure to achieve the needed equity funding or establish profitable operations would have
a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Note
4. Property and Equipment    

The
Company started the construction of several websites all of which have been completed and were amortized over three years. Computers
and furniture are being depreciated over three to seven years.  

Property
and equipment were as follows:  

Note
5. Commitments and Contingencies    

Lease
Commitments   

The
Company gave up its leased office space in Jupiter, Florida in January 2014, and acquired a new office in Newport Beach, California.
The Florida leaseholder obtained a judgment in the amount of $181,968 for the remainder of the monthly lease payments through
June 2016 pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement plus legal fees of $1,487. The Company has recorded the full amount of
the judgment, however believes that when the facility is re-leased it may not have to pay the full amount. Upon the leaseholder s
execution of a new lease with a new tenant, the Company plans to file for the release of the amount of the judgment over and above
the actual loss incurred by the leaseholder. There is no guarantee the property will be re-leased or that such a filing will be
successful and that the Company will be able to mitigate its loss in this way.  

In
January 2014, the Company entered into a lease at the rate of $1,439 per month which ended December 2014. In January 2015, the
Company was equipped to operate in a virtual environment. We believe that our existing arrangement which provides for virtual
pbx telephone,   la carte conference space, address services, mail forwarding and hosting facilities to be highly cost
effective and adequate to meet our current needs. The Company plans to seek suitable additional space when needed.  

The
Company has not invested in any real property at this time, nor does the Company intend to do so. The Company has no formal policy
with respect to investments in real estate or investments with persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.  

Legal   

In
June of 2013, a former officer of the Company filed a lawsuit against the Company and its President and directors alleging several
counts, including a breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and seeking damages in the amount of $122,300 and other unspecified
damages. On March 20, 2015 the court entered a final judgment in the amount of $200,761 comprised of the principal amount of $122,344
plus prejudgment interest from September 15, 2012 through the date of judgment in the amount of $54,421, costs in the amount of
$773, and attorney s fees of $23,222. The court dismissed the case against any party not listed in the final order and the
case is now closed as to all parties. As of September 30, 2015 the Company had accrued in full for this liability of $200,761
in its financial statements.  

Note
6. Stockholders  Deficit    

The
Company has authorized 200,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock
with a par value of $0.001.  

During
the year ended June 30, 2016 the Company issued 3,708,039 shares of common stock valued at $1,463,483 for services rendered by
related parties, 112,500 shares of common for services valued at $112,500, and 476,461 shares of common stock in payment of Directors 
fees valued at $162,000.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued 150,000 shares of common stock in payment of services to a related
party.  

Note
8. Loans from Directors and Shareholders    

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 a related party advanced the Company loans in the amount of $4,703. As of September
30, 2016 the balance of loans outstanding was $54,731. The loans are non-interest bearing and due on demand.  

Share
valuations are determined by the closing quoted share price of the stock on the date the issuance is authorized by the Board of
Directors.  

Note
9. Income Taxes    

The
components of the deferred tax asset are as follows:  

The
Company had available approximately $1,693,500 at September 30,2016 and $1,688,800 at June 30, 2016 of unused federal and Florida
net operating loss carry-forwards that may be applied against future taxable income. These net operating loss carry-forwards expire
through 2033. There is no assurance that the Company will realize the benefit of the net operating loss carry-forwards. ASC No.
740 requires a valuation allowance to be recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.  

Reconciliation
of the differences between the statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate is as follows at September 30, 2016 and June
30, 2016 respectively:  

Statutory rate    
        34  %  
 
     State taxes, net of federal tax benefit    
        0  %  
 
     Effective tax rate    
        34  %  

Note
10. Subsequent Events    

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events from September 30, 2016 through the date the financial statements were available to be
issued and has determined that, other than as disclosed above, there have been no subsequent events after September 30, 2016 for
which disclosure is required.

    environment; and;    

whether
    we will purchase any of our shares in the open markets or otherwise.    

OVERVIEW   

To
more effectively facilitate the process of shifting to retail distribution, in November 2013, Richard Damion joined our Company
as the acting Chief Executive Officer. He was then approved by the Board of Directors as the Company s Chief Executive Officer
in January, 2014. On February 15, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed A.R. (Bud) Grandsaert as the Company s
new President. Richard Damion resigned as the Company s President as of that date, however, he remains the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Director.  

We
determined during the first quarter of 2015 that we would transition out of our lower margin, perishable snack food product lines
and have focused our resources solely on developing our new healthy beverages. Amaize Beverage Corporation will continue to focus
on developing its healthy beverage product line with a plan to sell to large retailers and club stores in the United States. The
Company recently completed development of a unique  better for you  beverage with purple corn as its primary ingredient.
Purple corn has historical roots of over thousands of years yet is newly rediscovered for its incredible health benefits. Leading
Research   Development companies in the United States have been gathering data on its health benefits and working on integrating
its benefits into a number of consumer products. The beverage, with super antioxidant status, is a unique blend of fruits and
spices, offering extraordinary health benefits and great taste. Our initial portfolio design includes three beverage lines; Amaize 
100% Natural Purple Corn Beverage, Amaizing Tea  and Amaizing Lemonade . We plan to launch our Amaize  100%
Natural Purple Corn Drink ahead of our blended teas and blended lemonades to establish our distribution network with a one of
a kind product and to later,   red-carpet   our tea and lemonade beverages through an established distribution
system. The fact that the average American drinks over seven drinks per day allows plenty of opportunity to market a healthy drink,
helping us to achieve our mission of providing a positive healthy delicious beverage .  While there can be no assurance,
management believes that this strategy will ultimately prove successful. The Company is currently seeking the necessary financing
to pursue its business and growth plans, however, no assurances can be given that the Company will obtain the necessary financing.  

We
are a virtual company with a focus on staying lean through the use of cloud based technologies, maintaining low overhead, subcontracting
services, creating sales through commissioned brokers, developing products through reputable co-packers and keeping little to
no inventory except for use in sales and business development activities.  

Industry
wide factors that affect us include the increasing prevalence of obesity in adults and children and demand for healthier foods
and beverages worldwide.  

According
    to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1.7 billion adults are overweight and 400 million are obese. By 2015,
    it is predicted that 2.3 billion adults will be overweight and more than 700 million will be obese. Obesity rates among children
    have also climbed, with more than 30 percent now overweight or obese.   

According
    to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over the last 30 years, obesity among American children ages 6 to 11years
    has more than doubles.   

Studies
    show that the most effective way to prevent obesity is to address it during childhood by instilling healthy habits which starts
    with the very basis of cutting back on sugary drinks, eating the right foods and exercising daily.   

Significant
Accounting Policies    

For
the Company s significant accounting policies see   Footnote 2   to the accompanying September 30, 2016
unaudited financial statements.  

Presentation   

Net
sales,   reflect distribution allowances, handling and shipping income, represent what we collect and recognize as net
revenues in our financial statements.  

Our
  gross profit   consists of net sales less   cost of sales,   which represents the prices we
pay to our raw material suppliers and manufacturers of our products as well as costs related to product shipments to our warehouse
and distribution center, duties and tariffs, expenses relating to shipment of products to customers and importers and similar
expenses.  

Selling
fees   consist of commissions, overrides and production bonuses.  

Our
  operating margins   consist of net sales, less cost of sales and selling fees.  

General
and administrative expenses   represent our operating expenses, components of which include labor and benefits, sales
and marketing events, professional fees, travel and entertainment, marketing, occupancy costs, communication costs, bank fees,
depreciation and amortization and other miscellaneous operating expenses.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Our
results of operations for the periods below are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods, which
depend on numerous factors, including our ability to distribute our products through major retailers, open new markets, penetrate
existing markets, and our ability to secure, develop and introduce new products.   

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 31, 2015   

Revenue    

The
Company revised its sales method from network marketing sales through individual brand partners to direct to consumer and retail
store sales at the end of its fiscal year June 30, 2013. The Company had no revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015.  

Cost
of Revenues    

The
Company recognized no cost of sales in the three month periods ended September, 2016 or 2015 as it recognized no sales during
these periods.  

Gross
Profit    

The
Company recognized no gross profit in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 due to the factors described above.  

Selling
Expenses    

The
Company incurred no selling expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as it had no sales activity in these
periods.  

General
and Administrative Expenses    

General
and administrative expenses comprised the following for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional advisor fees, audit fees and travel associated with exploring new
opportunities. Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $465,000
less than the three month period last year. This was due less shares being issued to related parties for services included in
independent contractors, no additional product costs and substantial reduction in technology costs.  

Settlement
of Liabilities with Equity    

Provision
for Income Taxes    

We
incurred taxable losses; consequently no liability for taxation was incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016
or 2015.  

Net
Loss    

The
net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $24,509 as compared to $505,620 for the three months ended September
30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

The
Company had a cash balance of $0 at September 30, 2016 and a working capital deficit as follows:  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital
and to successfully implement its business plan. Management believes that the actions presently being taken and the success of
future operations may be sufficient to enable the Company to continue as a going concern. However, there can be no assurance that
the raising of equity will be successful. Failure to achieve the needed equity funding could have a material adverse effect on
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Cash
Flows    

The
following table summarizes selected items from our accompanying  Statement of Cash Flows  for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s operating expenses were paid by a shareholder from their
bank account in the amounts of $4,703 and $9,014 respectively.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements    

At
September 30, 2016 we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

ITEM
4 - Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

A
system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-l5(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934,as amended the  Exchange Act  are controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance
that the information that the Company is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls is based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Moreover, over time, controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  

The
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure
controls and procedures for the Company, and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report, based on their evaluation
of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), due to certain material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below.  

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting   

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting
for the Company. Due to limited resources, Management conducted an evaluation of internal controls based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
The results of this evaluation determined that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of September 30,
2016, due to material weaknesses. A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is defined as a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our
financial reporting.  

Management s
assessment identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting:  

The
    small size of our Company limits our ability to achieve the desired level of separation of internal controls and financial
    reporting. We currently do not have independent directors on our Board of Directors to review and oversee the financial policies
    and procedures of the Company.   

We
    do not have a functional audit committee since our Board of Directors acts as the audit committee.   

We
    have not achieved the desired level of documentation of our internal controls and procedures. When the Company obtains sufficient
    funding, this documentation will be strengthened through utilizing a third party consulting firm to assist management with
    its internal control documentation and further help to limit the possibility of any lapse in controls occurring.   

As
a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above, the Company s management
has concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective
based on the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.  

To
date, the Company has not been able to establish an Audit Committee with an independent director due its limited financial resources.
When the Company obtains sufficient funding, Management intends to add establish its Audit Committee and charge them with assisting
the Company in addressing the material weaknesses noted above. The Company s lack of current financial resources makes it
impossible for the Company to hire the appropriate personnel needed to overcome these weaknesses and ensure that appropriate controls
and separation of responsibilities of a larger organization exist. We also will continue to follow the standards for the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for internal control over financial reporting to include procedures that:  

Pertain
    to the maintenance of records in reasonable detail accurately that fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
    Company s assets;   

Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
    of management and the Board of Directors; and   

Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Our
management determined that there were no changes made in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting.  

This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public
accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this period report.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM
1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

In
June 2013, a former officer of the Company filed a lawsuit against the Company and its President and directors alleging several
counts, including a breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and seeking damages in the amount of $122,300 and other unspecified
damages. On March 20, 2015 the court entered a final judgment in the amount of $200,761 comprised of the principal amount of $122,344
plus prejudgment interest from September 15, 2012 through the date of judgment in the amount of $54,421, costs in the amount of
$773, and attorney s fees of $23,222. A full provision for this liability has been recorded in our financial statements
during the year ended June 30, 2015. The court dismissed the case against any party not listed in the final order and the case
is now closed as to all parties (see  Note 4. Commitments and Contingencies  to the financial statements).
