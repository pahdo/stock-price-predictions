Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Change in Accounting Principle    
    
  We use certain acronyms and terms throughout these notes to financial statements, which are defined in the   Glossary of Terms  . Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us," and "our" refer to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis or its management.  
    
  Basis of Presentation.   The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC requirements for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
    
  The financial statements contain all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full calendar year or any other interim period. 
    
  Our significant accounting policies and certain other disclosures are set forth in   Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     in our   2015   Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to these policies through   September 30, 2016  , with the exception of the change in accounting principle. 
    
  Change in Accounting Principle.   On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires a reclassification on the statement of condition of unamortized debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability from assets to a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  
    
  The guidance became effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2016 and was adopted retrospectively. As a result, unamortized concessions on consolidated obligations that were included in other assets at   December 31, 2015   were reclassified as a reduction to the corresponding consolidated obligations. The reclassification resulted in a reduction in consolidated obligation discount notes of   $920   and consolidated obligation bonds of   $11,113   at   December 31, 2015  . Accordingly, total assets and total liabilities were each reduced at   December 31, 2015   by   $12,033  . The adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on our results of operations or cash flows.  

Use of Estimates.     When preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to make subjective assumptions and estimates that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expense. The most significant estimates include derivatives and hedging activities, fair value estimates, the provision for credit losses, and OTTI. Although the reported amounts and disclosures reflect our best estimates, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 
    
  Reclassifications.   We have reclassified certain amounts from the prior period to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income, total comprehensive income, total capital, or net cash flows.

Note 2 - Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Guidance 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance. 
    
  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  . On March 10, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under GAAP does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  
    
  This guidance becomes effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The amendments provide entities with the option to apply the guidance using either a prospective approach or a modified retrospective approach to all derivative instruments that meet the specific conditions. We elected to early adopt the guidance prospectively on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.   On April 15, 2015, the FASB issued amendments to clarify a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendments provide guidance to customers on determining whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license, the license element of the arrangement should be accounted for as internal-use software; otherwise, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract.  
    
  The guidance became effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2016 and was adopted prospectively. The adoption of this guidance had no effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  
    
  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance to enhance the consolidation analysis for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and MBS transactions). The new guidance primarily emphasizes: (i) risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest, such that a reporting organization may no longer have to consolidate a legal entity in certain circumstances based solely on its fee arrangement when certain criteria are met; (ii) reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling interest in a VIE; and (iii) potentially changing consolidation exclusions for entities in several industries that typically make use of limited partnerships or VIEs.  
    
  The guidance became effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2016 and was adopted prospectively. The adoption of this guidance had no effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Guidance. 
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments on the statement of cash flows to reduce current and potential future diversity in practice regarding eight specific cash flow issues.  
  This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. This guidance should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance. Although the adoption of this guidance will have no effect on our financial condition or results of operations, its effect on the statement of cash flows has not yet been determined.  
  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The amendments require entities to measure expected losses instead of incurred losses. Such measurement must be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances.

   Table of Contents  

Notes to Financial Statements  , continued 
  (Unaudited, $ amounts in thousands unless otherwise indicated) 

The new guidance requires a financial asset, or a group of financial assets, measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected over the contractual term of the financial asset. The guidance also requires, among other provisions, the following: 

The statement of income must reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the increases or decreases in expected credit losses that have taken place during the period;     
                
    Entities must determine the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination in a manner similar to other financial assets measured at amortized cost. The initial allowance for credit losses is required to be added to the purchase price;  
                
    Entities must record credit losses relating to AFS debt securities through an allowance for credit losses. The amendments limit the allowance for credit losses to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost; and 
                
    Public entities must further disaggregate the current disclosure of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables by the year of origination (i.e., vintage). 
       
  This guidance is effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted as of the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. This guidance should be applied using a modified-retrospective approach whereby a cumulative-effect adjustment is recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. In addition, the guidance requires the use of a prospective transition approach for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination and for debt securities for which OTTI had been recognized before the effective date. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance. Therefore, its effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows has not yet been determined.  
    
  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments  . On March 14, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt host contracts. The guidance requires entities to apply only the four-step decision sequence when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts. Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks.  
    
  This guidance becomes effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the period for which the amendments are adopted. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance. Therefore, its effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows has not yet been determined. 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.     On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. This guidance outlines a comprehensive model for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry specific guidance. In addition, this guidance amends the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer. This guidance applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of certain other standards, such as financial instruments, certain guarantees, insurance contracts, or lease contracts. The guidance provides entities with the option of using either of the following two methods upon adoption: (i) a full retrospective method, applied to each prior reporting period presented; or (ii) a modified retrospective method, with the cumulative effect of initially applying this guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption.  
    
  On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date of the guidance by one year. In 2016, the FASB has issued additional amendments to clarify certain aspects of the guidance; however, the amendments do not change the core principle in the guidance. 
    
  The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted only as of the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2017. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance, but its effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is not expected to be material.

Realized Gains and Losses.   There were no sales of AFS securities during the   three or nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no intention of selling the AFS securities in an unrealized loss position nor did we consider it more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before our anticipated recovery of each security's remaining amortized cost basis.

    For private-label ABS, total unrealized losses do not agree to total gross unrecognized holding losses at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   of   $959   and   $1,031  , respectively. Total unrealized losses include non-credit-related OTTI losses recorded in AOCI of   $110   and   $132  , respectively, and gross unrecognized holding gains on previously OTTI securities of   $34   and   $61  , respectively. 
       
  Contractual Maturity.     The only non-MBS HTM security held at   December 31, 2015   matured in 2016. MBS and ABS are not presented by contractual maturity because their actual maturities will likely differ from contractual maturities as certain borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations with or without prepayment fees. 

Note 5 - Other-Than-Temporary Impairment    
    
  OTTI Evaluation Process and Results - Private-label RMBS and ABS.   On a quarterly basis, we evaluate for OTTI our individual AFS and HTM investment securities that have been previously OTTI or are in an unrealized loss position. As part of our evaluation, we consider whether we intend to sell each security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery of amortized cost. If either of these conditions is met, we recognize an OTTI loss in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost and its estimated fair value at the statement of condition date. For those impaired securities that meet neither of these conditions, we perform a cash flow analysis to determine whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security as described in   Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   and   Note 6 - Other-Than-Temporary Impairment     in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  OTTI - Significant Inputs.   The FHLBanks' OTTI Governance Committee developed a short-term housing price forecast with projected changes ranging from a decrease of   1%   to an increase of   10%   over a twelve-month period. For the vast majority of housing markets, the changes range from an increase of   3%   to an increase of   6%  . Thereafter, a unique path is projected for each geographic area based on an internally developed framework derived from historical data.

The following table presents the significant modeling assumptions used to determine the amount of credit loss recognized in earnings during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   on the one security for which an OTTI was determined to have occurred, as well as the related current credit enhancement. Credit enhancement is defined as the percentage of subordinated tranches, excess spread, and over-collateralization, if any, in a security structure that will generally absorb losses before we will experience a loss on the security. A credit enhancement percentage of zero reflects a security that has no remaining credit support and is likely to have experienced an actual principal loss. The classification (prime, Alt-A or subprime) is based on the model used to project the cash flows for the security, which may not be the same as the classification by the rating agency at the time of origination.

Results of OTTI Evaluation Process.   As a result of our analysis, on   one   security initially impaired prior to January 1, 2015, OTTI credit losses of   $75   and   $168   were recognized for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and OTTI credit losses of   $29   and   $61   were recognized for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. We determined that the unrealized losses on the remaining private-label RMBS and ABS were temporary as we expect to recover the entire amortized cost. 

OTTI Evaluation Process and Results - All Other AFS and HTM Securities. 
    
  Other U.S. and GSE Obligations and TVA Debentures.   For other U.S. obligations, GSE obligations, and TVA debentures, we determined that, based on current expectations, the strength of the issuers' guarantees through direct obligations of or support from the United States government is sufficient to protect us from any losses. As a result, all of the gross unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016   are considered temporary.

  Credit Risk Exposure and Security Terms.   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had a total of   $14.7 billion   and   $14.8 billion  , respectively, of advances outstanding, at par, to single borrowers with balances that were greater than or equal to   $1.0 billion  . These advances, representing   56%   and   55%  , respectively, of total advances at par outstanding on those dates, were made to   eight   borrowers. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held sufficient collateral to secure the advances to these borrowers.

Note 7 - Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio    
    
  The following tables present information on mortgage loans held for portfolio by term and by type. 

(1)   
    Defined as a term of   15   years or less at origination. 

See   Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses   for information related to credit risk on mortgage loans and allowance methodology for loan losses. 

Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses    
    
  We have established a methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses for each of our portfolio segments: credit products (advances, letters of credit, and other extensions of credit to members); term securities purchased under agreements to resell; term federal funds sold; government-guaranteed or -insured mortgage loans held for portfolio; and conventional mortgage loans held for portfolio. A description of the allowance methodologies for our portfolio segments as well as our policy for impairing financing receivables and charging them off when necessary is disclosed in     Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   and   Note 9 - Allowance for Credit Losses   in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
    
  Credit Products.   Using a risk-based approach, we consider the amount and quality of the collateral pledged and the borrower's financial condition to be the primary indicators of credit quality on the borrower's credit products. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had rights to collateral on a borrower-by-borrower basis with an estimated value in excess of our outstanding extensions of credit.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any credit products that were past due, on non-accrual status, or considered impaired. In addition, there were no TDRs related to credit products during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  Based upon the collateral held as security, our credit extension and collateral policies, our credit analysis and the repayment history on credit products, we have not recorded any allowance for credit losses on credit products, and no liability was recorded to reflect an allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures. For additional information about off-balance sheet credit exposure, see   Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies  .

  MPP Credit Enhancements.     The following table presents the activity in the LRA. 

The following table presents the estimated impact of credit enhancements on the allowance for MPP loan losses.   

(1)   
    Amounts recoverable are limited to (i) the estimated losses remaining after borrower's equity and PMI and (ii) the remaining balance in each pool's portion of the LRA. The remainder of the LRA balance is available to cover any losses not yet incurred and to distribute any excess funds to the PFIs. 
       
  MPF Credit Enhancements.   CE fees paid to PFIs totaled   $74   and   $233   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with   $87   and   $271   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. Performance-based CE fees may be withheld to cover losses allocated to us.  
    
  Any losses that occur in a pool will either be: (i) recovered through the withholding of future performance-based CE fees from the PFI or (ii) absorbed by us in the FLA. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our exposure under the FLA was   $3,509   and   $3,482  , respectively. The PFIs  CE obligations available to cover losses in excess of the FLA totaled   $26,862   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Any estimated losses that would be absorbed by the CE obligation are not included in our allowance for loan losses. The resulting allowance for MPF loan losses at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $100   and   $125  , respectively.

Credit Quality Indicators.   The tables below present our key credit quality indicators for mortgage loans held for portfolio. 

(1)   
    Includes loans for which the decision of foreclosure or similar alternative, such as pursuit of deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, has been reported. Loans in process of foreclosure are included in past due categories depending on their delinquency status, but are not necessarily considered to be on non-accrual status. For additional discussion, see   Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
               (2)   
    Represents loans   90   days or more past due (including loans in process of foreclosure) expressed as a percentage of the total recorded investment in mortgage loans. The percentage excludes principal and interest amounts previously paid in full by the servicers on conventional loans that are pending resolution of potential loss claims. Many government loans, including FHA loans, are repurchased by the servicers when they reach   90   days or more delinquent status, similar to the rules for servicers of Ginnie Mae MBS, resulting in the lower serious delinquency rate for government loans.  
               (3)   
    Although our past due scheduled/scheduled MPP loans are classified as loans past due   90   days or more based on the mortgagor's payment status, we do not consider these loans to be on non-accrual status. For additional discussion, see   Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     in our   2015   Form 10-K.

Allowance for Loan Losses on Mortgage Loans.   The table below presents a rollforward of our allowance for loan losses.  

The tables below present our allowance for loan losses by impairment methodology and the recorded investment in mortgage loans by impairment methodology.  

(1)   
    The recorded investment in our MPP conventional loans individually evaluated for impairment excludes principal previously paid in full by the servicers as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   of   $3,034   and   $4,639  , respectively, that remains subject to potential claims by those servicers for any losses resulting from past or future liquidations of the underlying properties. However, the MPP allowance for loan losses as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   includes   $17   and   $68  , respectively, for these potential claims.

The first table presents the recorded investment, UPB and related allowance associated with these loans, while the next table presents the average recorded investment of individually impaired loans and related interest income recognized.

The following table presents, by type of hedged item, the gains (losses) on derivatives and the related hedged items in fair-value hedging relationships and the effect of those derivatives on net interest income. 

(1)   
    Includes the effect of derivatives in fair-value hedging relationships on net interest income that is recorded in the interest income/expense line item of the respective hedged items. Excludes the interest income/expense of the respective hedged items, which fully offset the interest income/expense of the derivatives, except to the extent of any hedge ineffectiveness. Net interest settlements on derivatives that are not in fair-value hedging relationships are reported in other income (loss). These amounts do not include the effect of amortization/accretion related to fair value hedging activities. 
       
  Managing Credit Risk on Derivatives.   We are subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative transactions. 
    
  For our uncleared derivatives, we have credit support agreements that contain provisions requiring us to post additional collateral with our counterparties if there is deterioration in our credit rating. If our credit rating is lowered by an NRSRO, we could be required to deliver additional collateral on uncleared derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate estimated fair value of all uncleared derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position (before cash collateral and related accrued interest on cash collateral) at   September 30, 2016   was   $118,960  , for which we have posted collateral, including accrued interest, with an estimated fair value of   $25,299   in the normal course of business. In addition, we held other derivative instruments in a net liability position of   $588   that are not subject to credit support agreements containing credit risk-related contingent features. If our credit rating had been lowered by an NRSRO (from an S P equivalent of AA+ to AA), we could have been required to deliver up to an additional   $5,000   of collateral (at estimated fair value) to our uncleared derivative counterparties at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  For cleared derivatives, the clearinghouse determines initial margin requirements, and credit ratings are not generally factored into the initial margin. However, clearing agents may require additional initial margin to be posted based on credit considerations, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades. We were not required by our clearing agents to post additional initial margin at   September 30, 2016  .

We measure the performance of each segment based upon the net interest spread of the underlying portfolio(s). Therefore, each segment's performance begins with net interest income. Direct other income and expense items also affect each segment's results. Direct other income/expense related to the traditional segment includes the direct earnings impact of derivatives and hedging activities related to advances and investment products as well as all other income and expense not associated with mortgage loans. The mortgage loans segment includes the direct earnings impact of derivatives and hedging activities as well as direct salary and other expenses (including an allocation for indirect overhead) associated with operating the MPP and MPF Program, and volume-driven costs associated with master servicing and quality control fees. The assessments related to AHP have been allocated to each segment based upon each segment's proportionate share of income before assessments.

Pledged Collateral.     At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had pledged cash collateral, at par, of   $326,287   and   $146,280  , respectively, to counterparties and clearing agents. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had not pledged any securities as collateral. 
    
  Legal Proceedings.   We are subject to legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is probable that a loss for which we could be liable has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In 2010, we filed a complaint asserting claims against several entities for negligent misrepresentation and violations of state and federal securities law occurring in connection with the sale of private-label RMBS to us. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, we executed confidential settlement agreements with certain defendants in this litigation, pursuant to which we have dismissed all pending claims against, and provided legal releases to, certain entities with respect to all applicable securities at issue in the litigation, in consideration of our receipt of cash payments from or on behalf of those defendants. These payments, net of legal fees and litigation expenses, totaled   $0   and   $60   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $0   and   $4,732   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, and were recorded in other income. We had previously dismissed the complaint as to the other named defendants. As a result, all proceedings in the RMBS litigation we filed have been concluded.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Presentation  
    
  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our   2015   Form 10-K and the   Financial Statements   and related   Notes to Financial Statements   contained in   Item 1. Financial Statements  .  
    
  As used in this Item, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us," "our," and the "Bank" refer to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis or its management. We use certain acronyms and terms throughout this Item that are defined in the   Glossary of Terms   located in   Item 1. Financial Statements  . 
    
  Unless otherwise stated, amounts are rounded to the nearest million; therefore, dollar amounts of less than one million may not be reflected and, due to rounding, may not appear to agree to the amounts presented in thousands in the   Financial Statements   and related   Notes to Financial Statements  . Amounts used to calculate dollar and percentage changes are based on numbers in thousands. Accordingly, calculations based upon the disclosed amounts (millions) may not produce the same results. 

Executive Summary 
    
  Overview.   We are a regional wholesale bank that makes secured loans in the form of advances to our members; purchases whole mortgage loans from our members; purchases other investments; and provides other financial services to our members.  
    
  We are wholly owned by our member institutions. All member institutions are required to purchase a minimum amount of our Class B capital stock as a condition of membership.  
    
  Our principal source of funding is the proceeds from the sale to the public of FHLBank debt instruments, called consolidated obligations, which are the joint and several obligation of all FHLBanks. We obtain additional funds from deposits, other borrowings, and the sale of capital stock to our members. 
    
  Our primary source of revenue is interest earned on a  dvances, mortgage loans, and long- and short-term investments. 
    
  Our net interest income is primarily determined by the interest spread between the interest rate earned on our assets and the interest rate paid on our share of the consolidated obligations. We use funding and hedging strategies to manage the related interest-rate risk. 
    
  We group our products and services within two operating segments: 

Traditional, which consists of (i) credit products (including advances, letters of credit, and lines of credit), (ii) investments (including federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, AFS securities and HTM securities) and (iii) correspondent services and deposits; and 
                
    Mortgage loans, which consist of (i) mortgage loans purchased from our members through our MPP   and (ii) participation interests purchased from 2012 to 2014 through the FHLBank of Topeka in mortgage loans originated by certain of its PFIs under the MPF Program  . 
       
  Economic Environment.   The Bank s financial performance is influenced by the level and volatility of market interest rates; national and regional economic conditions; and the strength of housing markets.  
    
  In September, 2016, the FOMC maintained the federal funds target range at 0.25% to 0.50%, noting an improvement in economic activity. Favorable signs include solid job gains and growth of household spending. However, business fixed investment continued to be soft, which partially offset the favorable factors. The FOMC noted that the inflation rate remains below the 2 percent objective. The FOMC also stated its intent to maintain its accommodative policy of reinvesting principal payments received from its agency debt and MBS holdings. Yields on U.S. Treasuries edged higher during the third quarter of 2016. The 10-year yield increased approximately 5 bps to 1.6% at September 30, 2016. 
  
   38 
   Table of Contents  

U.S. GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.9% for the third quarter of 2016 based on the "advance" estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Personal consumption spending, nonresidential fixed investment, private inventory investment, federal government spending, and exports were cited as contributors to GDP growth during this period.    
  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported continued job growth nationally in September, 2016. Gains in professional and business services and in health care were cited as drivers of job growth. The unemployment rate of 5.0% continued a pattern of little change since August, 2015. The preliminary September, 2016 unemployment rates for Indiana and Michigan were 4.6% and 4.5%, respectively, comparable to their rates for the previous month.      
  Indiana University s Center for Econometric Model Research projects Indiana's unemployment rate to remain fairly stable through 2018, though manufacturing employment is projected to begin to decline. The University of Michigan Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics anticipates Michigan s job growth rate remaining near 1.0% through 2018. The report cites professional and business services, construction, and trade-transportation-utilities as key job producers during the forecast period.    
  Freddie Mac s September 20, 2016 Outlook projects the total home sales level for 2016 to be the highest since 2006. Favorable homebuyer affordability measures have helped to bolster sales, as the impact of rising home prices has been more than offset by declining interest rates. This trend is projected to gradually reverse should home prices continue to increase and interest rates begin to rise. 
    
  Impact on Operating Results.   Market interest rates and trends affect our funding costs and yields on earning assets, including advances, purchased mortgage loans, and our investment portfolio. Additionally, market interest rates drive mortgage origination and prepayment activity, which can lead to both favorable and unfavorable interest margin volatility in our MPP and MBS portfolios.   
    
  Lending and investing activity by our member financial institutions is a key driver for our balance sheet and income growth. Local economic factors, particularly relating to the housing market, influence demand for advances and MPP sales activity by our member financial institutions in Indiana and Michigan. Recent economic data for Indiana and Michigan suggest improving conditions and positive trends, though at a modest pace. 
    
  See   Results of Operations and Changes in Financial Condition   herein for a detailed discussion of our results.

    Not meaningful.  
       
  The   decrease   in net income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to net unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities.  
    
  The   decrease   in net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to net unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities and, to a lesser extent, lower net proceeds from litigation settlements related to certain private-label RMBS. 
    
  The   increase   in total OCI for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to an increase in the unrealized gains on non-OTTI AFS securities.

  The   increase   in total assets at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   was attributable to a net increase in investments and mortgage loans partially offset by a net   decrease   in advances. 
    
  The   increase   in total liabilities at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   was attributable to a net increase in consolidated obligations to fund our asset growth and, to a lesser extent, an increase in MRCS reflecting a reclassification of all of the capital stock held by captive insurance company members as a result of the Final Membership Rule.  
    
  The   decrease   in total capital at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015   was due to the reclassification of all of the capital stock held by captive insurance company members to MRCS as a result of the Final Membership Rule.

Yields.   The yield on total interest-earning assets for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   1.36%  , an increase of   15   bps compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , resulting primarily from higher yields on advances and investment securities, partially offset by lower yields on mortgage loans. The decrease in the yields on mortgage loans was due to an increase in prepayments of MPP loans, resulting in accelerated amortization of purchased premiums on our newer loans. The cost of total interest-bearing liabilities for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   1.04%  , an increase of   21   bps from the prior year period due to higher funding costs on consolidated obligations and accelerated amortization of concession fees associated with the exercise of our call option on certain CO bonds funding our mortgage portfolios which were reissued at a lower cost. The net effect was a reduction in the net interest spread to   0.32%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.38%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The yield on total interest-earning assets for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   1.33%  , an increase of   11   bps compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , resulting primarily from higher yields on advances, partially offset by lower yields on mortgage loans. The decrease in the yields on mortgage loans was due to an increase in prepayments of MPP loans, resulting in accelerated amortization of purchased premiums on our newer loans. The cost of total interest-bearing liabilities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   1.01%  , an increase of   18   bps from the prior year period due to higher funding costs on consolidated obligations and accelerated amortization of concession fees associated with the exercise of our call option on certain CO bonds funding our mortgage portfolios which were reissued at a lower cost. The net effect was a reduction in the net interest spread to   0.32%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   0.39%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Additionally, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was higher by   $2 million   and   $5 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  , as a result of higher interest expense on MRCS due to a reclassification of all of the captive insurance company members' capital stock to MRCS effective with the Final Membership Rule.  
    
  Average Balances.   The average balances of interest-earning assets for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased compared to the same periods in   2015  , largely related to advances and investment securities. The average amount of advances outstanding increased by   9%   and   15%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015   generally due to members' higher funding needs. The increase in the average balances of investments was due primarily to purchases of GSE debentures and MBS. Additionally, the average amount of mortgage loans held for portfolio outstanding increased by   12%   and   13%   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015   due to purchases from members under MPP Advantage. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was due to an increase in consolidated obligations to fund the increases in the average balances of all interest-earning assets. 

Provision for Credit Losses  .   The change in the provision for credit losses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   was not material.

Other Income (Loss)  .     The following table presents the components of other income ($ amounts in millions).  

(1)   
    See   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies     for additional information on litigation settlements.  

The   decrease   in total other income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to net unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities and, in addition, for the   nine   month period, lower net proceeds from litigation settlements related to certain private-label RMBS.  
    
  Net Gains (Losses) on Derivatives and Hedging Activities.   Our net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities fluctuate due to     volatility in the overall interest rate environment as we hedge our asset or liability risk exposures. In general, we hold derivatives and associated hedged items to the maturity, call, or put date. Therefore, due to timing, nearly all of the cumulative net gains and losses for these financial instruments will generally reverse over the remaining contractual terms of the hedged items. However, there may be instances when we terminate these instruments prior to maturity or prior to the call or put dates. Terminating the financial instrument or hedging relationship may result in a realized gain or loss. See   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 9 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities     for more information. 
    
  The Bank uses interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of certain of its advances, consolidated obligations and AFS securities due to changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR). These hedging relationships are designated as fair value hedges. To the extent these relationships qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in earnings. The estimated fair values are based on a wide range of factors, including current and projected levels of interest rates, credit spreads and volatility.  
    
  For those hedging relationships that qualified for hedge accounting, the differences between the change in the estimated fair value of the hedged items and the change in the estimated fair value of the associated interest rate swaps, i.e., hedge ineffectiveness, were net losses of   $5 million   and   $8 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to a net   gain   of   $38 thousand   and   $6 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  To the extent these hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, or cease to qualify because they are determined to be ineffective, only the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in earnings with no offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item. 
    
  For derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting (economic hedges), the net interest settlements and the changes in the estimated fair value of the derivatives are recorded in net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities. For economic hedges, the Bank recorded net losses of   $146 thousand   and   $2 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to a net   loss   of   $697 thousand   and   $1 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.

  Other Expenses  .   The following table presents the components of other expenses ($ amounts in millions). 

The increase in other operating expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   is primarily due to higher professional fees and services as well as software amortization and maintenance fees.  
    
  Total Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).   Total other comprehensive income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted primarily of unrealized gains on non-OTTI AFS securities. Total other comprehensive loss for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   consisted primarily of unrealized losses on OTTI and other AFS securities.

   Table of Contents  

Operating Segments 
    
  Our products and services are grouped within two operating segments:     traditional and mortgage loans. 
    
  Traditional.   The traditional segment consists of credit products (including advances, letters of credit, and lines of credit), investments (including federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, AFS securities, and HTM securities), and correspondent services and deposits. The following table presents the financial performance of our traditional segment ($ amounts in millions).  

The   increase   in net income for the traditional segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was due to higher interest income primarily as a result of a higher average balance of advances and investments outstanding. This was partially offset by net unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities.  
    
  The decrease in net income for the traditional segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was due to net unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities as well as lower net proceeds from litigation settlements related to certain private-label RMBS. This decrease was partially offset by higher net interest income primarily as a result of a higher average balance of advances and investments outstanding.  
    
  Mortgage Loans.   The mortgage loans segment includes (i) mortgage loans purchased from our members through our MPP and (ii) participation interests purchased from 2012 to 2014 through the FHLBank of Topeka in mortgage loans originated by certain of its PFIs under the MPF Program.   The following table presents the financial performance of our mortgage loans segment ($ amounts in millions).  

The   decrease   in net income for the mortgage loans segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income resulting from an increase in prepayments of MPP loans causing accelerated amortization of purchased premiums on our newer loans. The decrease also resulted from higher funding costs and the accelerated amortization of concession fees associated with the exercise of our call option on certain CO bonds funding our mortgage loan portfolio which were reissued at a lower cost. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the average balance of mortgage loans outstanding.

Analysis of Financial Condition 
    
  Total Assets.   The table below presents our major asset categories ($ amounts in millions). 

(1)   
    Includes accrued interest receivable, premises, software and equipment, derivative assets and other miscellaneous assets. 
       
  Total assets were   $52.9 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , a net   increase   of   $2.3 billion   or   5%   compared to   December 31, 2015  . This   increase   was primarily due to an increase in investment securities and mortgage loans held for portfolio. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in advances and cash and short-term investments, which altered the mix of our assets during the period.  
    
  Advances.   In general, advances fluctuate in accordance with our members' funding needs related to their deposit levels, mortgage pipelines, investment opportunities, available collateral, balance sheet strategies, and the cost of alternative funding options. Advances at carrying value totaled   $26.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a net   decrease   of   $436 million   or   2%   compared to   December 31, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to repayments by depository institution members and repayments by, and restrictions upon new or renewed advances to, captive insurance companies as a result of the Final Membership Rule. 
    
  Under the Final Membership Rule, captive insurance companies that were admitted as FHLBank members prior to September 12, 2014 and do not meet the new definition of "insurance company" or fall within another category of institution that is eligible for FHLBank membership shall have their membership terminated by February 19, 2021. Prior to termination, new advances to such members will be subject to certain restrictions relating to maturity dates and the ratio of advances to the captive insurer's total assets. The outstanding advances to these captive insurers mature on various dates through 2025.  
    
  Under the Final Membership Rule, captive insurance companies that were admitted as FHLBank members on or after September 12, 2014 and do not meet the new definition of "insurance company" or fall within another category of institution that is eligible for FHLBank membership are no longer eligible for new or renewed advances and shall have their membership terminated by February 19, 2017. Upon termination, all of their outstanding advances shall be repaid.  

50 
   Table of Contents  

The table below presents advances by type of financial institution ($ amounts in millions). 

Certain of our advances may be prepaid by the member without incurring a prepayment or termination fee. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $7.1 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of such advances outstanding, at par, which represent 27% and 24% of total advances, respectively. All other advances may only be prepaid by the borrower paying a fee that is sufficient to make us financially indifferent to the prepayment of the advance.  

Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio.     In general, our volume of mortgage loans purchased is affected by several factors, including interest rates, competition, the general level of housing and refinancing activity in the United States, consumer product preferences and regulatory considerations. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we purchased   $2.2 billion   of conventional mortgage loans through MPP Advantage. 
    
  The Bank Act requires the Finance Agency to establish low-income housing goals for mortgage purchases. Under its housing goals regulation, the Finance Agency will establish low-income housing goals for FHLBanks that acquire, in any calendar year, more than $2.5 billion of conventional mortgages through an AMA program and will determine their housing goals performance. In 2015, our conventional mortgage purchase volume exceeded $2.5 billion. The Finance Agency determined with respect to 2015, however, that it would not require us to submit a housing plan, which could otherwise have been required under the regulation if we exceeded the mortgage purchase threshold and fail to meet the low-income housing goals. In anticipation that our 2016 conventional mortgage purchase volume may exceed $2.5 billion, in July 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the Bank to purchase up to $3.0 billion of conventional mortgage loans from our members in 2016. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, our conventional mortgage purchase volume for the year has exceeded $2.5 billion.

   Table of Contents  

A breakdown of mortgage loans held for portfolio by primary product type is presented below ($ amounts in millions). 

The increase in the UPB of mortgage loans held for portfolio in 2016 of   $1.1 billion   was due to purchases of mortgage loans under MPP Advantage exceeding repayments of outstanding MPP and MPF Program loans. Over time, the outstanding balance of mortgage loans purchased under our original MPP and the MPF Program will continue to decrease since all purchases are currently under MPP Advantage.  
    
  We have established and maintain an allowance for loan losses based on our best estimate of probable losses over the loss emergence period. Our estimate of MPP losses remaining after borrower's equity was   $6 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . After consideration of the portion recoverable under the associated credit enhancements, the resulting allowance for MPP loan losses was less than   $1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . See   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses     for more information.  
    
  Cash and Investments.     The following table presents the components of our cash and investments at carrying value ($ amounts in millions).   

52 
   Table of Contents  

Cash and Short-Term Investments.     Cash and     short-term investments totaled   $4.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   of   8%   compared to   December 31, 2015  . Cash and short-term investments as a percent of total assets were   9%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   10%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The total outstanding balance and composition of our short-term investment portfolio is influenced by our liquidity needs, market conditions and the availability of short-term investments at attractive interest rates, relative to our cost of funds. 
    
  Investment Securities.     AFS securities, which consist primarily of GSE and TVA debentures, totaled   $6.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a net   increase   of   56%   compared to   $4.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase is due to the Bank's resumption of purchases of these debentures after the Finance Agency's clarification in July 2015 of the components, measurement and thresholds of the core mission asset ratio. Net unrealized gains on AFS securities at   September 30, 2016   were   $49 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , the percentage of non-MBS AFS securities due in one year or less was   22%  , due after one year through five years was   39%  , and due after five years was   39%  . See   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 3 - Available-for-Sale Securities   for more information. 
    
  HTM securities, which consist substantially of MBS, totaled   $6.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a   decrease   of   5%   compared to   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of our HTM securities in an unrealized loss position totaled   $2.9 billion  ; however, unrealized losses on those securities totaled only   $14 million  . See   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 4 - Held-to-Maturity Securities   for more information. 
    
  See   Risk Management - Credit     Risk Management - Investments - Long-Term Investments   herein for more information on our investment securities.  
    
  Total Liabilities.   Total liabilities were   $50.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a net   increase   of   $2.3 billion   or   5%   compared to   December 31, 2015  . This increase was due to an   increase   in consolidated obligations to fund our asset growth and, to a lesser extent, an increase in MRCS reflecting a reclassification of all of the capital stock held by captive insurance company members as a result of the Final Membership Rule.  
    
  Deposits (Liabilities).   Total deposits were   $578 million   at   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   4%   compared to   December 31, 2015  . The balances of these custodial accounts can fluctuate from period to period. These deposits represent a relatively small portion of our funding and vary depending upon market factors, such as the attractiveness of our deposit pricing relative to the rates available on alternative money market instruments, members' investment preferences with respect to the maturity of their investments, and member liquidity.   
    
  Consolidated Obligations.     The overall balance of our consolidated obligations fluctuates in relation to our total assets and the availability of alternative sources of funds. The composition of our consolidated obligations can fluctuate significantly based on comparative changes in their cost levels, supply and demand conditions, demand for advances, and our overall balance sheet management strategy. At   September 30, 2016  , the carrying values of our discount notes and CO bonds totaled   $16.4 billion   and   $32.7 billion  , respectively, compared to   $19.3 billion   and   $27.9 billion  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . Discount notes are issued to provide short-term funds, while CO bonds are generally issued to provide a longer-term mix of funding.  
    
  The following table presents a breakdown by term of our consolidated obligations outstanding ($ amounts in millions).

   Table of Contents  

We are focused on maintaining a liquidity and funding balance between our financial assets and financial liabilities. Additionally, the FHLBanks work collectively to manage FHLB System-wide liquidity and funding and jointly monitor System-wide refinancing risk. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the FHLBanks may consider contractual maturities of the financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e., estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). See   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 3 - Available-for-Sale Securities  ,   Note 4 - Held-to-Maturity Securities  ,   Note 6 - Advances  , and   Note 10 - Consolidated Obligations   for more detailed information regarding contractual maturities of certain of our financial assets and liabilities.  
    
  Derivatives.     As     of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had derivative assets, net of collateral held or posted, including accrued interest, with estimated fair values of   $140 million   and   $50 million  , respectively, and derivative liabilities, net of collateral held or posted, including accrued interest, with estimated fair values of   $94 million   and   $81 million  , respectively. Increases and decreases in the fair value of derivatives are primarily caused by changes in the derivatives' underlying interest-rate index. 
    
  The volume of derivative hedges is often expressed in terms of notional amounts, which is the amount upon which interest payments are calculated. The following table highlights the notional amounts by type of hedged item whether or not it is in a qualifying hedge relationship ($ amounts in millions). 

Total Capital.   Total capital at   September 30, 2016   was   $2.3 billion  , a net   decrease   of   $46 million   or   2%   compared to   December 31, 2015  . This   decrease   is due primarily to the reclassification of all of the capital stock held by captive insurance company members to MRCS resulting from the Final Membership Rule. 
    
  The following table presents a percentage breakdown of the components of GAAP capital. 

The change in the percentage composition of our total GAAP capital is primarily due to the reclassification of all of the capital stock held by captive insurance company members to MRCS effective with the Final Membership Rule.  
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP capital to regulatory capital ($ amounts in millions).  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity.     Our primary sources of liquidity are holdings of cash and short-term investments and the issuance of consolidated obligations. Our cash and short-term investments portfolio totaled   $4.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we maintained sufficient access to funding; our net proceeds from the issuance of consolidated obligations totaled   $299.7 billion  . 

54 
   Table of Contents  

We have not identified any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are likely to materially increase or decrease our liquidity. 
    
  Capital Resources.  
    
  Total Regulatory Capital  .   A breakdown of our outstanding capital stock, categorized by type of member institution, and MRCS is provided in the following table ($ amounts in millions).  

(1)   
    Balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   include   $6 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, of MRCS that had reached the end of the five-year redemption period but will not be redeemed until the associated credit products and other obligations are no longer outstanding. 
       
  Under the Final Membership Rule, captive insurance companies that were admitted as FHLBank members on or after September 12, 2014 and do not meet the new definition of "insurance company" or fall within another category of institution that is eligible for FHLBank membership shall have their membership terminated by February 19, 2017. These captive insurers collectively held   $12 million   of MRCS as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Under the Final Membership Rule, captive insurance companies that were admitted as FHLBank members prior to September 12, 2014 and do not meet the new definition of "insurance company" or fall within another category of institution that is eligible for FHLBank membership shall have their membership terminated by February 19, 2021. These captive insurers collectively held   $152 million   of MRCS as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Excess Stock.     Excess stock is capital stock that is not required as a condition of membership or to support outstanding obligations of members or former members to us. In general, the level of excess stock fluctuates with our members' level of advances. The following table presents the composition of our excess stock ($ amounts in millions).  

Capital Distributions.     On   October 27, 2016  , our board of directors declared a cash dividend of   4.25%   (annualized) on our putable-Class B-1 capital stock and   3.40%   (annualized) on our putable-Class B-2 capital stock.

Adequacy of Capital.     At   September 30, 2016  , our regulatory capital ratio was   4.69%  , and our leverage capital ratio was   7.03%  , both in excess of the regulatory requirement. See   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 12 - Capital   for more information. 
  We must maintain sufficient permanent capital to meet the combined credit risk, market risk and operations risk components of the risk-based capital requirement. As presented in the following table, we were in compliance with the risk-based capital requirement at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   ($ amounts in millions).  

The increase in our total risk-based capital requirement was primarily caused by an increase in the credit risk component that was mainly the result of the net increase in our outstanding balance of mortgage loans. The operations risk capital component is calculated as 30% of the credit and market risk capital components. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , mortgage loan principal previously paid in full by our MPP servicers of   $3 million   remains subject to potential claims by those servicers for any losses resulting from past or future liquidations of the underlying properties. An estimate of the losses is included in the MPP allowance for loan losses. See   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses   for more information.  
    
  See     Notes to Financial Statements - Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies     for information on additional commitments and contingencies.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  We have identified four accounting policies that we believe are critical because they require management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These accounting policies relate to: 

Derivatives and hedging activities (see   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 9 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities     for more detail); 
                
    Fair value estimates (see   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 15 - Estimated Fair Values     for more detail);  
                
    Provision for credit losses (see   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses     for more detail); and 
                
    OTTI (see   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 5 - Other-Than-Temporary Impairment     for more detail). 
       
  A full discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates can be found in   Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   in our   2015   Form 10-K. See below for additional information regarding certain of these policies. 
    
  Provision for Credit Losses.  
    
  Mortgage Loans Acquired under the MPP  .   Our allowance for loan losses incorporates our analysis of delinquent conventional MPP loans, using the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, further reduced by estimated liquidation costs.  
    
  We also performed our loan loss analysis at December 31, 2015 under an adverse scenario whereby we increased the haircut on our underlying collateral values to 45% from 25% for delinquent conventional loans, including individually evaluated loans.  While holding all other assumptions constant, such scenario would have increased our allowance by approximately $0.4 million at December 31, 2015. We consider a haircut of 45% on the modeled values to result in the lowest collateral value that is reasonably possible to occur over the loss emergence period of 24 months.  
  
   56 
   Table of Contents  

After evaluating this adverse scenario, we determined that the likelihood of incurring losses resulting from this scenario during the next 24 months was not probable. Therefore, the allowance for loan losses is based upon our best estimate of the probable losses over the next 24 months that would not be recovered from the credit enhancements. We continue to monitor the appropriateness of this adverse scenario on a quarterly basis.  
    
  These estimates require significant judgments, especially considering the inability to readily determine the fair value of all underlying properties and the uncertainty in other macroeconomic factors that make estimating defaults and severity increasingly imprecise. 
    
  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis.   We evaluate our AFS and HTM investment securities on a quarterly basis to determine if any unrealized losses are other-than-temporary. Our evaluation is based in part on the creditworthiness of the issuers, and in part on the security's underlying collateral and expected cash flows. An OTTI has occurred if our cash flow analysis determines that a credit loss exists, i.e., the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the security's amortized cost, irrespective of whether management will be required to sell such security. 
    
  The following table presents the significant modeling assumptions used to determine whether a security was OTTI during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as well as the related current credit enhancement as of   September 30, 2016  . Credit enhancement is defined as the percentage of subordinated tranches, excess spread, and over-collateralization, if any, in a security structure that will generally absorb losses before we will experience a loss on the security. A credit enhancement percentage of zero reflects a security that has no remaining credit support and is likely to have experienced an actual principal loss. The classification (prime, Alt-A or subprime) is based on the model used to project the cash flows for the security, which may not be the same as the classification by the rating agency at the time of origination ($ amounts in millions). 

(1)   
    Excludes one manufactured housing loan ABS, with a UPB of   $8 million  , for which underlying collateral data is                       not readily available and alternative procedures are used to evaluate for OTTI. 
               (2)   
    Weighted average based on UPB. 
               (3)   
    Insured by monoline bond insurers.  
       
  In addition to evaluating our private-label RMBS under a best estimate scenario  ,   we perform a cash flow analysis for each of these securities under a more stressful housing price scenario. This more stressful scenario is primarily based on a short-term housing price forecast that is   5%   lower than the best estimate scenario, followed by a recovery path with annual rates of housing price growth that are   33%   lower than the best estimate.  
    
  The actual OTTI-related credit losses recognized in earnings for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $75 thousand  . Under the more stressful scenario, the estimated OTTI-related credit losses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $106 thousand  . 
    
  Additional information regarding OTTI of our private-label RMBS and ABS is provided in   Notes to Financial Statements - Note 5 - Other-Than-Temporary Impairment  .

  Legislative and Regulatory Developments. 
    
  FHLBanks - Minority and Women Inclusion.     On October 27, 2016, the Finance Agency published proposed amendments to its Minority and Women Inclusion regulations that, if adopted, would clarify the scope of the FHLBanks  obligation to promote diversity and ensure inclusion, in part by expanding recordkeeping and reporting requirements. These proposed amendments update existing Finance Agency regulations aimed at promoting diversity and the inclusion and utilization of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities in all FHLBank business and activities, including management, employment and contracting.     
  The proposed amendments would: 
             
    require the FHLBanks to develop standalone diversity and inclusion strategic plans or incorporate diversity and inclusion into their existing strategic planning processes and adopt strategies for promoting diversity and ensuring inclusion; 
                
    encourage the FHLBanks to expand contracting opportunities for minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities through subcontracting arrangements; 
                
    require the FHLBanks to amend their policies on equal opportunity in employment and contracting by adding sexual orientation, gender identity, and status as a parent to the list of protected classifications; and 
                
    require the FHLBanks in their annual reports to the Finance Agency to provide extensive data on contracting and detailed descriptions of their efforts to advance diversity and inclusion through capital market transactions, affordable housing and community investment programs, initiatives to improve access to mortgage credit, and strategies for promoting the diversity of supervisors and managers.  
       
  Comments on the proposed amendments are due by December 27, 2016. We are currently assessing the potential effects of the proposed amendments.  
    
  FHLBank Membership for Non-Federally-Insured Credit Unions  .   On September 28, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed amendments to regulations governing FHLBank membership that would implement recent statutory amendments to the Bank Act authorizing FHLBanks to accept applications for membership from state-chartered credit unions not covered by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund ("privately-insured credit unions"), provided that certain prerequisites have been met. The new rule, if adopted, would generally treat these credit unions the same as other depository institutions, with an additional requirement that they obtain an affirmative statement from their state regulator that they meet the requirements for Federal insurance as of the date of their application for FHLBank membership, or a written statement from the state regulator that it cannot or will not make any determination regarding eligibility for Federal insurance. If the regulator fails or refuses to respond to the credit union s request within six months, the credit union would be required to provide to the FHLBank written confirmation of its failure to receive a response. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by November 28, 2016. Based upon guidance provided by the Finance Agency following the amendment to the Bank Act and before the issuance of the proposed rule, we have admitted three privately-insured credit unions as members.

FHLBank Indemnification Payments.     On September 20, 2016, the Finance Agency issued a re-proposed rule that, if adopted, would establish standards for identifying whether an indemnification payment by an FHLBank or the OF to an officer, director, employee, or other entity-affiliated party in connection with an administrative proceeding or civil action instituted by the Finance Agency is prohibited or permissible. Under the proposed rule, those payments with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action that has been initiated by the Finance Agency are only permitted if they relate to: 

premiums for professional liability insurance or fidelity bonds for directors and officers, to the extent that the insurance or fidelity bonds cover expenses and restitution, but not a judgment in favor of the Finance Agency or a civil money penalty; 
                
    expenses of defending an action, subject to an agreement to repay those expenses in certain instances; and 
                
    amounts due under an indemnification agreement entered into prior to the publication of a final rule. 
       
  The proposed rule also outlines the process a board of directors must undertake prior to making any permitted indemnification payment for expenses of defending an action initiated by the Finance Agency. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by December 21, 2016. We are currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule but do not anticipate that, if adopted, it would materially impact us. 
  FHLBank New Business Activities  .   On August 23, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed a rule that, if adopted, would reduce the scope of new business activities ("NBAs") for which an FHLBank must seek approval from the Finance Agency, and would establish more certain timelines for Finance Agency review and approval of NBA notices. The proposed rule also would clarify the protocol for Finance Agency review of NBAs. Under the proposed rule, acceptance of new types of legally permissible collateral by the FHLBanks would not constitute a NBA or require prior approval from the Finance Agency. Instead, the Finance Agency would review new collateral types as part of its annual examinations of the FHLBanks.  
    
  On October 24, 2016, the FHLBanks provided comments on the proposed rule, primarily relating to certain procedures described in the proposed rule. We do not anticipate that the proposed rule, if adopted, would materially impact us. 
  Mandatory Contractual Stay Requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts ("QFCs")  .   On August 19, 2016, the OCC issued a proposed rule, which, if adopted, would require certain systemically important financial institutions ("SIFIs") regulated by the OCC to limit a counterparty s immediate termination or exercise of default rights in the event of bankruptcy or receivership of the SIFI or an affiliate of the SIFI. Covered QFCs include derivatives, repurchase agreements (known as "repos") and reverse repos, and securities lending and borrowing agreements. On May 3, 2016, the FRB issued a substantively identical proposed rule with respect to QFCs entered into with globally systemically important banking organizations ("GSIBs") and their affiliates that are subject to regulation in the U.S. In addition, on October 26, 2016, the FDIC issued a parallel proposed rule applicable to certain FDIC-supervised institutions.   
    
  The FHLBanks provided comments on the FRB proposed rule on August 5, 2016 and on the OCC proposed rule on October 18, 2016, primarily seeking clarification of an exemption and the recognition of a safe harbor for the use of certain International Swaps and Derivatives Association stay protocols in connection with QFCs. We do not anticipate that the proposed rule, if adopted, would materially impact us, but it would require us to amend any covered QFCs entered into with FRB-regulated GSIBs or OCC-regulated SIFIs. 
    
  European Union ("EU") Market Abuse Regulation  .   The EU issued updated Market Abuse Regulations ("MAR") that became effective July 3, 2016 and which contain rules on insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information and market manipulation for debt and equity securities on European securities exchanges. The MAR differ in certain respects from U.S. regulations. The MAR apply to issuers with securities admitted to trading on EU exchanges, including EU exchanges on which FHLBank CO bonds are listed. The MAR contain an exemption to the requirements for certain public bodies and central banks of third world countries. The FHLBanks and the Office of Finance are examining whether this exemption applies to them, given their GSE status. If the exemption does not apply, we anticipate that the most significant impact of the MAR on us will be more stringent and detailed recordkeeping and notification requirements.

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") Rule 4210 Establishing Margin Requirements for the TBA Market  .   On June 15, 2016, the SEC approved a proposed rule promulgated by FINRA to require the margining of certain TBA transactions. Specifically, the approved FINRA Rule 4210 will require FINRA members to collect from, but not post to, their customer s maintenance margin (  i.e.,   initial margin) and variation margin on transactions that are  Covered Agency Transactions,  subject to certain exemptions. A "Covered Agency Transaction" includes (certain terms are defined under FINRA rules): 

TBA transactions inclusive of ARM transactions and Specified Pool Transactions (as defined in the proposed rule), for which the difference between the trade date and contractual settlement date is greater than one business day; and 
                
    CMOs issued in conformity with a program of an agency or a GSE for which the difference between the trade date and contractual settlement date is greater than three business days. 
       
  Transactions with a counterparty in multifamily housing securities are exempt from the margin requirements provided that the securities are issued by certain US government agencies or a GSE and the FINRA member makes a written risk limit determination for each such counterparty. 
    
  Under the rule, we are exempt from posting initial margin but would be required to post variation margin to a FINRA-member counterparty in connection with covered transactions if we have more than $10 million in gross open positions with the counterparty. FINRA members will be required to comply with the new margin requirements beginning in December 2017.  
    
  We are currently assessing the financial and operational impacts of this rule. 
   
  Risk Management 
    
  We have exposure to a number of risks in pursuing our business objectives. These risks may be broadly classified as market, credit, liquidity, operational, and business. Market risk is discussed in detail in   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  . See   Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management   in our   2015   Form 10-K for more detailed information.  
    
  Credit Risk Management.   We face credit risk on advances and other credit products, investments, mortgage loans, derivative financial instruments, and AHP grants.  
    
  Advances and Other Credit Products.     Advances, at par, to our insurance company members were   55%   and   53%   of total advances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. On March 18, 2016, our board of directors modified the initial borrowing limit for insurance company members (excluding captive insurance companies) to 25% of their total general account assets less money borrowed. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had advances outstanding, at par, of   $475.0 million   to   one   of our insurance company members whose total credit products exceeded 25% of its general account assets, net of money borrowed. Credit extensions to insurance company members whose total credit products exceed this threshold require an additional approval by our Bank as provided in our credit policy. The approval is based upon a number of factors that may include the member's financial condition, collateral quality, business plan and earnings stability. We also monitor these members more closely on an ongoing basis.    
    
  Effective February 19, 2016, new or renewed credit extensions to captive insurance companies that became members prior to September 12, 2014 cannot, per the Final Membership Rule, exceed 40% of the member's total assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , one such captive insurance company member exceeded that limit and therefore is not eligible for additional credit products until its outstanding borrowings fall below the limit. Under the Final Membership Rule, captive insurance companies that became members after September 12, 2014 are no longer eligible for new or renewed credit extensions.  
    
  Concentration.   Our credit risk is magnified due to the concentration of advances in a few borrowers. As of   September 30, 2016  , our top two borrowers held   21%   of total advances outstanding, at par, and our top five borrowers held   43%   of total advances outstanding, at par. As a result of this concentration, we perform frequent credit and collateral reviews on our largest borrowers. In addition, we analyze the implications to our financial management and profitability if we were to lose the business of one or more of these borrowers.

Investments  .   We are also exposed to credit risk through our investment portfolios. Our policies restrict the acquisition of investments to high-quality, short-term money market instruments and high-quality long-term securities.  
    
  Short-Term Investments  . Our short-term investment portfolio at   September 30, 2016   included securities purchased under agreements to resell that mature overnight and are secured by U.S. Treasuries. In addition, our short-term investment portfolio includes unsecured credit exposure to United States branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks that is limited to federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits.   
    
  The following table presents the unsecured investment credit exposures to private counterparties, categorized by the domicile of the counterparty's parent, based on the lowest of the NRSRO long-term credit ratings of the counterparty, stated in terms of the S P equivalent. The table does not reflect the foreign sovereign government's credit rating ($ amounts in millions).  

Long-Term Investments  . A Finance Agency regulation provides that the total value of our investments in MBS and ABS, calculated using amortized historical cost, must not exceed 300% of our total regulatory capital, consisting of retained earnings, Class B capital stock, and MRCS, as of the day we purchase the securities, based on the capital amount most recently reported to the Finance Agency. These investments were   292%   of total regulatory capital at   September 30, 2016  . Generally, our goal is to maintain these investments near the 300% limit in order to enhance earnings and capital for our members and diversify our revenue stream.

The following table presents the carrying values of our investments, excluding accrued interest, by credit rating, grouped by investment category. Applicable rating levels are determined using the lowest relevant long-term rating from S P, Moody's and Fitch, each stated in terms of the S P equivalent. Rating modifiers are ignored when determining the applicable rating level for a given counterparty or investment. Amounts reported do not reflect any subsequent changes in ratings, outlook, or watch status ($ amounts in millions).

Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio. 
    
  PMI.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had PMI coverage on   $1.3 billion   or   16%   of our conventional MPP mortgage loans. For a conventional loan, PMI, if applicable, covers losses or exposure down to approximately an LTV ratio between 65% and 80% based upon the original appraisal, original LTV ratio, term, and amount of PMI coverage. 

LRA.   The following table presents the changes in the LRA for original MPP and MPP Advantage ($ amounts in millions).  

SMI.   As of   September 30, 2016  , we were the beneficiary of SMI coverage, under our original MPP, on conventional mortgage pools with a total UPB of   $1.2 billion  . Two mortgage insurance companies provide all of the SMI coverage.  

The following table presents the lowest credit ratings from S P, Moody's, and Fitch, stated in terms of the S P equivalent, for our SMI companies and the estimated SMI exposure as of   September 30, 2016   ($ amounts in millions).

Mortgage Loan Characteristics.   Two indicators of credit quality are LTV ratios and credit scores provided by FICO       . FICO        provides a commonly used measure to assess a borrower s credit quality, with scores ranging from a low of 300 to a high of 850. The combination of a lower FICO        score and a higher LTV ratio is a key driver of potential mortgage delinquencies and defaults. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   97%   of the borrowers in our conventional loan portfolio had FICO        scores greater than 680 at origination, and   84%   had an LTV ratio of 80% or lower.

Derivatives.     Our over-the-counter derivative transactions are either (i) executed with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or (ii) cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent) with a clearinghouse (cleared derivatives). See   Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management -Credit     Risk Management - Derivatives   in our   2015   Form 10-K for more information.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  As used in this Item, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us," "our," and the "Bank" refer to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis or its management. We use certain acronyms and terms throughout this Item that are defined in the   Glossary of Terms   located in   Item 1. Financial Statements  . 
    
  Measuring Market Risks 
    
  We utilize multiple risk measurements, including duration of equity, duration gap, convexity, VaR, earnings at risk, and changes in MVE, to evaluate market risk. Periodically, stress tests are conducted to measure and analyze the effects that extreme movements in the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve would have on our risk position.  
    
  Market Risk-Based Capital Requirement.   When calculating the risk-based capital requirement, the VaR comprising the first factor of the market risk component is defined as the potential dollar loss from adverse market movements, for a holding period of 120 business days, with a 99% confidence interval, based on those historical prices and market rates. The table below presents the VaR ($ amounts in millions). 

Certain Market and Interest-Rate Risk Metrics under Potential Interest-Rate Scenarios.   We also monitor the sensitivities of MVE and the duration of equity to potential interest-rate scenarios. The following table presents certain market and interest-rate metrics under different interest-rate scenarios ($ amounts in millions).  

(1)   
    Given the current environment of low interest rates, we have adjusted the downward rate shocks to prevent the assumed interest rate from becoming negative.  
               (2)   
    The decline in the MVE/Book value of equity from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   can primarily be attributed to the change in market value of the assets and liabilities in response to changes in the market environment and changes in certain pricing assumptions. 
               (3)   
    The changes in the duration of equity compared to   December 31, 2015   were partly due to changes in the market rate environment and updated modeling assumptions. This resulted in the shortening of the duration of both assets and liabilities; however, the duration of our assets shortened more than the duration of liabilities, which shortened the duration of equity. 
       
  Duration Gap.   The base case duration gap was   (1.3)   months at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.7   months at   December 31, 2015  . The causes of this change are the same as the causes of the change in the duration of equity. 
    
  See   Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Use of Derivative Hedges   in our   2015   Form 10-K for more information about our use of derivative hedges.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act") is: (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms; and (b) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of   September 30, 2016  , we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer), Chief Financial Officer (the principal financial officer), and Chief Accounting Officer (the principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.     There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Exchange Act that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.     We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and other internal controls will prevent all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can only be reasonable assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Additionally, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
