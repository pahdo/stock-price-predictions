  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (dollars in thousands) 

1.      Basis of Presentation  : 
  The accompanying unaudited financial statements include the condensed consolidated accounts of The Hillman Companies, Inc. ( Hillman Companies ) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively  Hillman  or the  Company ). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements present information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and applicable rules of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all information or footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. Management believes that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation. Operating results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for the full year. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

2.      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  :  
  The significant accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies included in the Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
  Reclassifications: 
  Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the prior periods' net income (loss), cash flows, or stockholders' equity.  As a result of implementation of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)   during the first quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified deferred financing fees from non-current assets to long term liabilities.  The reclassification reduced deferred financing fees and long term liabilities by approximately   $16,900   and   $19,400   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.     

3.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements  : 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The update outlines a five-step model and related application guidance, which replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date by one year making the guidance effective for us in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. The amendments can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard recognized at the date of initial application. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date. The Company is currently assessing the transition method and impact of implementing this guidance on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

3.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements   (continued): 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customer.   This guidance amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in ASU 2014-09. This ASU clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. Therefore, for contracts involving more than one specified good or service, the entity may be the principal for one or more specified goods or services and the agent for others. This ASU has the same effective date as the new revenue standard, ASU 2014-09, and entities are required to adopt this ASU by using the same transition method used to adopt the new revenue standard.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. This ASU clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing on the previously issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (  Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting. ASU 2016-11 rescinds several SEC Staff Announcements that are codified in Topic 605, including, among other items, guidance relating to accounting for shipping and handling fees and freight services.  In May 2016, the FASB also issued ASU 2016-12, which provided narrow scope improvements and practical expedients related to ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   The improvements address completed contracts and contract modifications at transition, noncash consideration, the presentation of sales taxes and other taxes collected from customers, and assessment of collectability when determining whether a transaction represents a valid contract. ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11, and ASU 2016-12 are effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, and for interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-11 and ASU 2016-12 can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the transition method and impact of implementing this guidance on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The update requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company has adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2016.  As a result of adopting this guidance, the Company recorded a reduction to deferred financing fees and a corresponding reduction to long term liabilities of approximately   $16,900   and   $19,400   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  There was no impact on Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss or Cash Flows as a result of the adoption of this guidance. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued the ASU No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  .  The intent is to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.  The amendments in the update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.  The amendments in this update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position.  For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.  Earlier adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company has elected early adoption of this standard in the first quarter of 2016. There was no impact on Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss or Cash Flows as a result of the adoption of this guidance.  Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   The amendments in this update require lessees, among other things, to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under previous authoritative guidance. This update also introduces new disclosure requirements for leasing arrangements. The new guidance will be effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. Early adoption will be permitted for all entities. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented with various optional practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of implementing this guidance on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

3.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements   (continued): 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This ASU affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The ASU is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows, and forfeiture rate calculations. This ASU will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. The Company has elected early adoption of this standard in the first quarter of 2016. There was no impact on Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss or Cash Flows as a result of the adoption of this guidance.  Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses.   The ASU sets forth a  current expected credit loss  (CECL) model which requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). The update amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice related to eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

4.      Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  :       
  Goodwill amounts by reporting unit are summarized as follows:  

(1) 
    These amounts relate to adjustments resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

  (dollars in thousands) 

4.      Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   (continued): 
  Other intangibles, net, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consist of the following:  

The amortization expense for amortizable assets including the adjustments resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates was   $9,481   and   $9,488   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The amortization expense for amortizable assets including the adjustments resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates was   $28,435   and   $28,523   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and for impairment annually. Impairment is also tested when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets  carrying values may be greater than their fair values. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company did not adjust goodwill or intangible assets to their fair values as a result of any impairment analyses.  

5.      Commitments and Contingencies  : 
  The Company self-insures our product liability, automotive, workers' compensation, and general liability losses up to   $250   per occurrence. Catastrophic coverage has been purchased from third party insurers for occurrences in excess of   $250   up to   $40,000  . The two risk areas involving the most significant accounting estimates are workers' compensation and automotive liability. Actuarial valuations performed by the Company's outside risk insurance expert were used by the Company's management to form the basis for workers' compensation and automotive liability loss reserves. The actuary contemplated the Company's specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required. Risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims, as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The Company believes the liability of approximately   $1,527   recorded for such risks is adequate as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has provided certain vendors and insurers letters of credit aggregating   $5,559   related to our product purchases and insurance coverage for product liability, workers  compensation, and general liability. 
  The Company self-insures group health claims up to an annual stop loss limit of   $200   per participant. Aggregate coverage is maintained for annual group health insurance claims in excess of   125%   of expected claims. Historical group insurance loss experience forms the basis for the recognition of group health insurance reserves. Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based on an analysis of historical insurance claims data and certain actuarial assumptions. The Company believes the liability of approximately   $1,500   recorded for such risks is adequate as of   September 30, 2016  .

5.      Commitments and Contingencies   (continued): 
  On October 1, 2013, The Hillman Group, Inc. ("Hillman Group") filed a complaint against Minute Key Inc., a manufacturer of fully-automatic, self-service key duplication kiosks, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Western Division), seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of a U.S. patent issued to Minute Key Inc. on September 10, 2013. Hillman Group's filing against Minute Key Inc. was in response to a letter dated September 10, 2013 in which Minute Key Inc. alleged that Hillman Group's FastKey  product infringes the newly-issued patent. 
  On October 23, 2013, Minute Key Inc. filed an answer and counterclaim against the Hillman Group alleging patent infringement. Minute Key Inc. also requested that the court dismiss the Hillman Group's complaint, enter judgment against the Hillman Group that the Company is willfully and deliberately infringing the patent, grant a permanent injunction, and award unspecified monetary damages to Minute Key Inc. 
  Minute Key Inc. later filed two motions on March 17, 2014 seeking to voluntarily withdraw its counterclaim alleging infringement by Hillman Group and also to dismiss Hillman Group's complaint for non-infringement and invalidity. Shortly after an April 23, 2014 court-ordered mediation, Minute Key Inc. provided Hillman Group with a covenant promising not to sue for infringement of two of its patents against any existing Hillman Group product, including the FastKey  and Key Express  products. 
  Hillman Group filed a motion on May 9, 2014 seeking to add additional claims to the case against Minute Key Inc. under Federal and Ohio state unfair competition statutes. These claims relate to Minute Key Inc.'s business conduct during competition with Hillman Group over a mutual client. 
  In an August 15, 2014 order, the court granted Minute Key Inc.'s March 17, 2014 motions to dismiss the claims relating to patent infringement and also granted Hillman Group's May 9, 2014 motion to add its unfair competition claims. 
  Hillman Group formally amended its complaint to add the unfair competition claims on September 4, 2014, and Minute Key Inc. answered on September 29, 2014 without filing any counterclaims. Minute Key Inc. filed a motion on October 1, 2014 to move the case from Cincinnati to either the District of Colorado or the Western District of Arkansas. The court denied that motion on February 3, 2015. 
  It is not yet possible to assess the impact, if any, that the lawsuit will have on the Company. As a result of the Minute Key Inc. covenant not to sue, however, the Company's FastKey  and Key Express  products no longer face any threat of patent infringement liability from   two   of Minute Key Inc.'s patents. The scope of the lawsuit changed from a bilateral dispute over patent infringement to a lawsuit solely about Minute Key Inc.'s business conduct. Minute Key Inc. filed a motion for summary judgment on February 8, 2016. The court denied that motion on July 8, 2016. Following the denial of Minute Key Inc. s summary judgment motion, a jury trial was held between August 24, 2016 and September 6, 2016.  The jury returned a verdict in Hillman Group s favor on September 6, 2016 finding that Minute Key Inc. s actions violated the Federal Lanham Act and the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices Act.  Following this verdict against Minute Key Inc., Hillman Group has filed post-trial motions for recovery of its costs, attorney fees, pre-and post-judgment interest, and an injunction.  Minute Key Inc. filed a post-trial motion to set aside the jury verdict.  All post-trial motions are pending before the court. 
    
  In addition, legal proceedings are pending which are either in the ordinary course of business or incidental to the Company s business. Those legal proceedings incidental to the business of the Company are generally not covered by insurance or other indemnity. In the opinion of the Company s management, the ultimate resolution of the pending litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, operations, or cash flows of the Company.

The rental expense for the lease of this facility was   $82   and   $83   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The rental expense for the lease of this facility was   $246   and   $247   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Hillman Group Canada ULC subsidiary of Hillman entered into   three   leases for   five   properties containing an industrial warehouse, manufacturing plant, and office facilities on February 19, 2013.

The rental expense for the three leases was   $468   and   $490   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

7.      Income Taxes  : 
    
  Accounting Standards Codification 740 ( ASC 740 ) requires companies to apply their estimated annual effective tax rate on a year-to-date basis in each interim period.  Under ASC 740, companies should not apply the estimated annual effective tax rate to interim financial results if the estimated annual effective tax rate is not reliably predictable.  In this situation, the interim tax rate should be based on the actual year-to-date results.  For the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , reliable projections of the Company s annual effective tax rate were difficult to determine, producing significant variations in the customary relationship between income tax expense and pre-tax book income. As such, the Company recorded income taxes for the period based on actual year-to-date results.  In the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company applied an estimated annual effective tax rate to the interim period pre-tax (loss) / income to calculate the income tax (benefit) / provision. 
    
  For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the effective income tax rates were   1,140.5%   and   27.4%   respectively. The Company recorded a tax provision / (benefit) for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   of   $479   and   $(2,471)   respectively.  The effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory tax rate in the three month period ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to certain non-deductible expenses for tax in relationship to the income reported for the third quarter. In addition, due to the cumulative loss recognized in previous years and in the current year in Australia, any tax benefit recorded is offset by the valuation allowance recorded against the subsidiary's loss.  While the tax benefit is offset by the valuation allowance, the loss decreases total income utilized in calculating the effective rate during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory tax rate in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   due in part to a tax benefit recorded in the current period from the reconciliation of a prior year s tax return to the amount reported for tax provision purposes.  The effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   also due in part to a valuation reserve recorded to offset the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary.  The remaining differences between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate in the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were primarily due to state and foreign income taxes. 
    
  The effective income tax rates were   99.2%   and   35.3%   for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The Company recorded a tax (benefit) for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $(5,187)   and   $(7,873)   respectively.  The effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to a change in the projected financial statement earnings for the year which decreased the estimated annual effective tax rate used to compute the interim period income tax (benefit) in accordance with the accounting guidance established for computing income taxes in interim periods.  The effective income tax rate also differed from the federal statutory rate in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   due in part to a valuation reserve recorded to offset the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. The remaining differences between the federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  were primarily due to state and foreign income taxes.

  Additional information with respect to the fair value of the Company s fixed rate senior notes and junior subordinated debentures is included in   Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements  . 

9.      Derivatives and Hedging  : 
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage our exposures to (1) interest rate fluctuations on our floating rate senior debt and (2) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company measures those instruments at fair value and recognizes changes in the fair value of derivatives in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge that offsets certain exposures. 
  Interest Rate Swap Agreements -   On   September 3, 2014  , the Company entered into two forward Interest Rate Swap Agreement (the  2014 Swaps ) with   three  -year terms for notional amounts of   $90,000   and   $40,000  . The forward start date of the 2014 Swaps was   October 1, 2015   and the termination date is   September 30, 2018  . The 2014 Swaps fix the interest rate at   2.2%   plus the applicable interest rate margin of   3.5%   for an effective rate of   5.7%  . 
  The total fair value of the interest rate swaps was   $(2,714)   as of   September 30, 2016   and was reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheet in other non-current liabilities with an increase in other expense recorded in the statement of comprehensive loss for the   unfavorable   change of   $150   in fair value since   December 31, 2015  . 
  The total fair value of the interest rate swaps was   $(2,564)   as of   December 31, 2015   and was reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheet in other non-current liabilities.  The Company recorded an increase in other expense recorded in the statement of comprehensive loss for the unfavorable change of   $2,528   in fair value in the nine months ended September 31, 2015. 
  The Company's interest rate swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because they did not meet the provisions specified in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ( ASC 815 ). Accordingly, the gain or loss on these derivatives was recognized in current earnings.

  During 2016, the Company entered into multiple foreign currency forward contracts (the  2016 FX Contracts ) with maturity dates ranging from   April 2016   to   April 2017  . The 2016 FX Contracts fixed the Canadian to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate at points ranging from   1.2536   to   1.3458  . The purpose of the 2016 FX Contracts is to manage the Company's exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar. 
  The total notional amount of contracts outstanding was   C$32,804   and   C$37,886   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The total fair value of the outstanding FX Contracts was   $60   and   $1,695   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and was reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in other current (liabilities) and assets, respectively. An   increase   in other expense of   $1,950   was recorded in the statement of comprehensive loss for the   unfavorable   change in fair value from   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Company's FX Contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because they did not meet the provisions specified in ASC 815. Accordingly, the gain or loss on these derivatives was recognized in current earnings. 
  The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and, therefore, holds no derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
  Additional information with respect to the fair value of derivative instruments is included in   Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements  . 

10.      Fair Value Measurements  : 
  The Company uses the accounting guidance that applies to all assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis. The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
                   Level 1: 
      
    Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
      Level 2: 
      
    Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. 
      Level 3: 
      
    Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity s own assumptions. 

The following tables set forth the Company s financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, by level, within the fair value hierarchy:

10.      Fair Value Measurements   (continued): 

The fair value of the Company's fixed rate senior notes and junior subordinated debentures as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were determined by utilizing current trading prices obtained from indicative market data. As a result, the fair value measurements of the Company's senior term notes and debentures are considered to be Level 2. 

Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements at book value, which approximates fair value, due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amount of the long-term debt under the revolving credit facility approximates the fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   as the interest rate is variable and approximates current market rates. The Company also believes the carrying amount of the long-term debt under the senior term loan approximates the fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   because, while subject to a minimum LIBOR floor rate, the interest rate approximates current market rates of debt with similar terms and comparable credit risk. 
  Additional information with respect to the derivative instruments is included in   Note 9 - Derivatives and Hedging  . Additional information with respect to the Company s fixed rate senior notes and junior subordinated debentures is included in   Note 8 - Long Term Debt  . 

11.      Transition, Acquisition, and Integration Expense  : 
    
  The Company did not have transaction related expenses during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . In the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred   $0   and   $257  , respectively, in transaction expenses related to the merger of CCMP and the Oak Hill Funds.

12.      Segment Reporting  : 
  The Company s segment reporting structure uses the Company s management reporting structure as the foundation for how the Company manages its business. The Company periodically evaluates its segment reporting structure in accordance with ASC 350-20-55 and has concluded that it has   five   reportable segments as of   September 30, 2016  : The United States, excluding All Points, All Points, Canada, Mexico, and Australia. The United States segment, excluding All Points, and the Canada segment are considered material by the Company s management as of   September 30, 2016  . In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company decided to exit the Australia market following the loss of a key customer and recorded charges of   $832   related to the write-off of inventory and other assets in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on revenue and income from operations, and does not include segment assets or nonoperating income/expense items for management reporting purposes. 
    
  The table below presents revenues and income (loss) from operations for our reportable segments for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

General 
  The Hillman Companies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "Hillman" or "Company") is one of the largest providers of hardware-related products and related merchandising services to retail markets in North America. Our principal business is operated through its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Hillman Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively,  Hillman Group ). Hillman Group sells its products to hardware stores, home centers, mass merchants, pet supply stores, and other retail outlets principally in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Product lines include thousands of small parts such as fasteners and related hardware items; threaded rod and metal shapes; keys, key duplication systems, and accessories; builder's hardware; and identification items, such as tags and letters, numbers, and signs. We support our product sales with services that include design and installation of merchandising systems and maintenance of appropriate in-store inventory levels. 

Current Economic Conditions 
  Our business is impacted by general economic conditions in the North American and international markets, particularly the U.S. and Canadian retail markets including hardware stores, home centers, mass merchants, and other retailers. 
  We are exposed to the risk of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the U.S. dollar versus local currency of our suppliers located primarily in China and Taiwan. We purchase a significant variety of our products for resale from multiple vendors located in China and Taiwan. The purchase price of these products is routinely negotiated in U.S. dollar  
  
   Page   16    

amounts rather than the local currency of the vendors and our suppliers' profit margins decrease when the U.S. dollar declines in value relative to the local currency. This puts pressure on our suppliers to increase prices to us. The U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the RMB by approximately 2.49% in 2014, increased by 4.40% in 2015, and increased by 2.94% during the period ended   September 30, 2016  . The U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the Taiwan dollar by approximately 5.93% in 2014, increased by 3.77% in 2015, and declined by 4.64% during the period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  In addition, the negotiated purchase price of our products may be dependent upon market fluctuations in the cost of raw materials such as steel, zinc, and nickel used by our vendors in their manufacturing processes. The final purchase cost of our products may also be dependent upon inflation or deflation in the local economies of vendors in China and Taiwan that could impact the cost of labor used in the manufacturing of our products. We identify the directional impact of changes in our product cost, but the quantification of each of these variable impacts cannot be measured as to the individual impact on our product cost with a sufficient level of precision. 
  We are also exposed to risk of unfavorable changes in Canadian dollar exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar. Our sales in Canada are denominated in Canadian dollars while a majority of the products are sourced in U.S. dollars.  A weakening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar results in lower sales in terms of U.S. dollars while the cost of sales remains unchanged.  We have a practice of hedging some of our Canadian subsidiary's purchases denominated in U.S. dollars. The U.S. dollar increased in value relative to the Canadian dollar by approximately 9.07% in 2014, increased by 19.30% in 2015, and decreased by 5.22% during the period ended   September 30, 2016  . In response, we have implemented price increases in the Canada operating segment during 2015 and 2016. We may take future pricing action, when warranted, in an attempt to offset a portion of product cost increases. The ability of our operating divisions to institute price increases and seek price concessions, as appropriate, is dependent on competitive market conditions.   

Results of Operations 
  The following analysis of results of operations includes a brief discussion of the factors that affected our operating results and a comparative analysis of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . 

The Three Month Period Ended   September 30, 2016   vs the Three Month Period Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $211.5 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $1.6 million   compared to net sales of $  209.9 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase over prior year was primarily driven by growth of domestic big box retailers and the completion of new customer rollouts, including the AutoZone fastener rollout in 2016. This was partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease as the result of the timing of a customer rollout in 2015. 
  
   Page   17    

Cost of Sales 
  Our cost of sales was   $111.0 million  , or   52.5%   of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   a decrease   of approximately   $2.8 million   compared to   $113.8 million  , or   54.2%   of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The decrease of 1.7%  in cost of sales, expressed as a percent of net sales, in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   was primarily due to a 1.1% decrease associated with our strategic sourcing initiatives in the current year, and a 0.9% decrease for the reduction in air freight costs, domestic sourcing, and other costs associated with the introduction of the new NDD line in the prior year. 
  Expenses 
  Operating expenses were approximately   $84.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of approximately   $1.0 million  , compared to   $85.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The following changes in underlying trends impacted the change in operating expenses: 

Selling expense was   $28.8 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $1.0 million   compared to   $27.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase in selling expense was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense to accommodate sales growth with big box retail and traditional customers. 

General and administrative ( G A ) expenses were   $12.6 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $1.3 million   compared to   $11.3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase was primarily due to $1.3 million in higher legal fees in the   third   quarter of   2016   related to our lawsuit against Minute Key Inc., see "  Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies  " of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Depreciation expense was   $8.0 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to depreciation expense of   $7.6 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The primary reason for the increase in depreciation expense was the fixed asset additions of key and engraving machines and software related to our ERP system. 

Amortization expense of   $9.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   was consistent with the amortization expense in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  

Other   income   was   $0.9 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to other   expense   of   $2.7 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  The increase in other income was due to the losses of $1.3 million on the interest rate swaps when adjusted to fair value in 2015. In the third quarter of   2016   we recorded a gain of $0.5 million on the mark to market adjustment on the interest rate swaps.

The   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Net Sales 
    
  Net sales for the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $628.0 million   compared to net sales of   $607.4 million   during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   $20.6 million     increase   was primarily driven by $7.9 million in growth with domestic big box retailers, $ 7.5 million in fastener sales to traditional and regional hardware stores, $6.5 million in higher sales of NDD line products due to completion of the 2015 product introduction, and $5.4 million from the AutoZone fastener rollout in 2016. These increases were partially offset by   $4.6 million   as a result of the timing of a customer rollout in 2015. 
  Cost of Sales 
  Our cost of sales was   $336.1 million  , or   53.5%   of net sales, in the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   a decrease   of   $0.1 million   compared to   $336.2 million  , or   55.3%   of net sales, in the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   of 1.8% in cost of sales, expressed as a percent of net sales, in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015    was due primarily to the reduction in air freight costs, domestic sourcing, and other costs associated with the introduction of the new NDD line in the prior year. 
    
  Expenses 
    
  Operating expenses were approximately   $253.2 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $6.6 million  , compared to   $246.6 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The primary reason for the increase in operating expenses was the additional variable costs associated with the   $20.6 million     increase   in net sales. The following changes in underlying trends impacted the change in operating expenses: 

Selling expense was   $86.7 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $3.8 million   compared to   $82.9 million   in the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   increase   in selling expense was primarily due to compensation and benefits expense to accommodate sales growth with big box retail and traditional customers. 

Warehouse and delivery expenses were   $79.9 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $4.3 million   compared to warehouse and delivery expenses of   $75.6 million   in the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in warehouse and delivery expenses was primarily due to $2.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expense, $1.1 million increase in freight, and $1.1 million increase in storage to accommodate sales growth with big box retail and traditional customers. 

General and administrative ( G A ) expenses were   $33.9 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $0.2 million   compared to   $33.7 million   in the period ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits as well as to $1.3 million in higher legal fees in the   third   quarter of   2016   related to our  
     
   Page   19    

lawsuit against Minute Key Inc. (see "  Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies  " of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) in the first   nine   months of   2016  . These increases were offset by decreased severance expense as compared to the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

Depreciation expense was   $24.4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $22.1 million   in the period ended   September 30, 2015  . The primary reason for the increase in depreciation expense was the fixed asset additions of key and engraving machines and software related to our ERP system. 

Other   income   of   $0.2 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $4.0 million   higher than other   expense   of   $3.8 million   in the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  The expense in the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   was primarily due to the loss of approximately $2.5 million on interest rate swaps when adjusted to fair value compared to a loss of $0.2 million in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, 2015 included approximately $0.5 million of expense related to the closure of a facility in Canada.   

Results of Operations   Operating Segments 
    
  The following table provides supplemental information regarding our net sales and profitability by operating segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands): 

The Three Month Period Ended   September 30, 2016   vs the Three Month Period Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $1.6 million   compared to the net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The United States, excluding All Points operating segment,   increased   net sales by   $4.0 million  , primarily driven by growth of domestic big box retailers and the completion of new customer rollouts including the $1.6 million sales increase from the AutoZone fastener rollout in 2016. Net sales for our Canada operating segment   decreased   by   $2.3 million  ,  primarily as a result of the timing of a customer rollout in 2015.  

Page   20    

Income from Operations 
  Income from operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $5.3 million   compared to income from operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Income from operations of our United States, excluding All Points segment increased by approximately   $2.6 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $15.3 million   as compared to   $12.7 million   in the comparable prior year period. In addition to the increase in sales discussed above, gross margin rates improved from 49.2% in 2015 to 50.9% in 2016 due to reduced costs driven by our strategic sourcing initiatives and decreased air freight, domestic sourcing, and other costs associated with the introduction of the  new line of nails, deck screws and drywall screws (the "NDD line") in the prior year. These increases were offset by $4.3 million in higher selling, warehouse and delivery costs, along with general and administrative costs associated with our sales growth. Income from operations was favorably impacted by $2.0 million lower severance and restructuring costs due to management restructuring in 2015. Finally, income from operations for the United States, excluding All Points segment was favorably impacted by $1.8 million for the change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in 2016 compared to 2015. 
    
  Income from operations in our Canada segment increased by   $3.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $1.0 million   as compared to a loss from operations of   $2.2 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase was driven by improved gross margin of $0.5 million related to price increases implemented in the current year to offset the impact of exchange rates. Additionally, our Canada segment had $2.2 million lower operating expense due to costs incurred in 2015 for a new customer roll out.  
    
  In the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we decided to exit the Australia market following the loss of a key customer and recorded charges of   $832   related to the write-off of inventory and other assets in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   vs the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Net Sales 
  Net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $20.6 million   compared to the net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The United States, excluding All Points operating segment, generated net sales growth of   $27.3 million  . The increase was driven by $7.9 million from growth of domestic big box retailers, $ 7.5 million in increased fastener sales to traditional and regional hardware stores, $6.5 million in higher sales of NDD line products due to completion of the 2015 product introduction, and $5.4 million from the new AutoZone contract in 2016. The All Points net sales   decreased   by   $1.5 million   primarily due to the lower fastener sales in the 2016 period as compared to the prior year period. Canada's net sales decreased by   $4.6 million   in the first   nine   months of 2016 due to the timing of a new customer roll out in 2015 along with the $1.0 million impact of unfavorable conversion of their local currency to U.S. dollars.  
    
  Income from Operations 
  Income from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     $14.0 million   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Income from operations of our United States, excluding All Points segment increased by approximately   $10.1 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $35.7 million   as compared to   $25.6 million   in the comparable prior year period. In addition to the sales discussed above, gross margin rates improved from 47.8% in 2015 to 49.7% in 2016 due to reduced costs driven by our strategic sourcing initiatives and decreased air freight costs, domestic sourcing, and other costs associated with the introduction of the new NDD line in the prior year. Gross margin improvement of  $22.5 million was partially offset by higher operating costs of $15.9 million associated with our sales growth in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . Income from operations was favorably impacted by $1.0 million in lower severance costs due to management restructuring costs in 2015. Finally, income from operations was favorably impacted by $2.3 million for the change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps; in 2016, we recorded a loss of $0.2 million compared to a loss of $2.5 million in the prior year. 
    
  The income from operations in our Canada segment increased by   $4.2 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to   $2.8 million   as compared to a loss from operations of   $1.4 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The improvement was driven by lower operating costs from $3.8 million in lower selling, warehouse, and delivery expense from a new customer roll out in 2015. Gross profit was $0.6 million lower as reduced sales were partially offset by price increases.  
  
   Page   21    

In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we decided to exit the Australia market following the loss of a key customer and recorded charges of   $832   related to the write-off of inventory and other assets in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Income Taxes 
    
  In the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded an income tax   provision   of   $0.5 million   on pre-tax   income   of   $0.04 million  .  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded an income tax   benefit   of   $2.5 million   on a pre-tax   loss   of   $9.0 million  . The effective income tax rates were   1,140.5%   and   27.4%  , respectively, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded an income tax   benefit   of   $5.2 million   on a pre-tax   loss   of   $5.2 million  .  In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded an income tax   benefit   of   $7.9 million   on a pre-tax   loss   of   $22.3 million  .  The effective income tax rates were   99.2%   and   35.3%  , respectively, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory tax rate in the three month period ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to certain non-deductible expenses for tax in relationship to the income reported for the third quarter financial statements. In addition, due to the cumulative loss recognized in previous years and in the current year in Australia, any tax benefit recorded is offset by the valuation allowance recorded against the subsidiary's loss.  While the tax benefit is offset by the valuation allowance, the loss decreases total income utilized in calculating the effective rate during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The difference between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was affected by a valuation reserve recorded to offset the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary.  The effective income tax rate in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was also affected by the benefit recorded to reconcile the 2015 income tax return as filed to the tax provision recorded for financial statement purposes. The net effect of the reconciliation was recorded in the current period as required by the accounting standard.  The remaining differences between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   were primarily due to state and foreign income taxes. 
    
  The difference between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily affected by the change in the estimated annual effective tax rate used to compute the interim tax provision as required by ASC 740-270, the accounting guidance established for computing income taxes in interim periods.  The net effect of the change was recorded in the current period as required by the accounting standard.  The effective income tax rate also differed from the federal statutory rate in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   due in part to a valuation reserve recorded to offset the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary.  The effective income tax rate also differed from the federal statutory rate in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to the effect of the foreign exchange gain/loss recognized in the financial statements in the reporting period.  The remaining differences between the effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   were primarily due to state and foreign income taxes. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The statements of cash flows reflect the changes in cash and cash equivalents for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   by classifying transactions into three major categories: operating, investing, and financing activities.  
    
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $55.6 million   as compared to a use of cash of   $37.1 million   in the comparable prior year period.  Operating cash flows for the first   nine   months of   2016   were favorably impacted by net sales growth along with a   $16.0 million   reduction in inventory driven by management s efforts to improve working capital. Cash used by operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was unfavorably impacted by an increase in inventory of approximately   $56.1 million   related to the build up of inventory for the roll out of the NDD line introduced in 2015. 

Page   22    

Net cash   used by   investing activities  was   $29.4 million   and   $18.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The primary use of cash for investing activities was capital expenditures offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of   $2.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Our capital expenditures by asset type are summarized as follows (in millions): 

Net cash   used by   financing activities was   $32.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We used cash to pay   $44.0 million   on the revolving credit loans,   $4.1 million   in principal payments on the senior term loan under the Senior Facilities, and   $0.2 million   in principal payments under capitalized lease obligations. The borrowings on revolving credit loans provided   $16.0 million  . 
    
  Net cash   provided by   financing activities was   $46.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The borrowings on revolving credit loans provided   $53.0 million  . We used cash to pay   $4.1 million   in principal payments on the senior term loan under the Senior Facilities,   $2.0 million   in payments on the revolving credit loans, and   $0.1 million   in principal payments under capitalized lease obligations. We used   $0.5 million   of cash to purchase shares from a former member of management and received cash of   $0.4 million   from the sale of stock. 
    
  Management believes that projected cash flows from operations and revolver availability will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next 12 months. Our working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) position of   $221.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   represents   a decrease   of   $26.6 million   from the   December 31, 2015   level of   $248.3 million  . 

Contractual Obligations 
  Our contractual obligations in thousands of dollars as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Page   23    

(2) 
    Interest payments for borrowings under the Senior Facilities, the 6.375% Senior Notes, and Revolver borrowings. Interest payments on the variable rate Senior Term Loans were calculated using 5.70% for the notional amount of   $130,000   under interest rate swap agreements and the actual interest rate of   4.5%   as of   September 30, 2016   was used for the remaining amount of the Senior Term Loans. Interest payments on the 6.375% Senior Notes were calculated at their fixed rate.   
               (4) 
    We have a purchase agreement with our supplier of key blanks which requires minimum purchases of 100 million key blanks per year. To the extent minimum purchases of key blanks are below 100 million, we must pay the supplier $0.0035 per key multiplied by the shortfall. Since the inception of the contract in 1998, we have purchased more than the requisite 100 million key blanks per year from the supplier. In 2013, we extended this contract through the end of 2016. 
              (5) 
    All of the contractual obligations noted above are reflected on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   except for the interest payments, purchase obligations, and operating leases. 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no material purchase commitments for capital expenditures. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). 
  Debt Covenants 
  Terms of the Senior Facilities subject the Company to a revolving facility test condition whereby a senior secured leverage ratio covenant of no greater than 6.5 times last twelve months Credit Agreement Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA comes into effect if more than 35.0% of the total Revolver commitment is drawn or utilized in letters of credit at the end of a fiscal quarter. If this covenant comes into effect, it may restrict the Company s ability to incur debt, make investments, pay interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures, or undertake certain other business activities. As of   September 30, 2016  , the total revolving credit commitment of the Company was   7.9%   utilized and the senior secured leverage ratio covenant was not in effect.  Below are the calculations of the financial covenant with the Senior Facilities requirement for the twelve trailing months ended   September 30, 2016  :  
  
   Page   24    

(1) Credit Agreement Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   is presented in the following Adjusted EBITDA section.  
    
  Credit Agreement Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 
  Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).  It should not be considered an alternative to GAAP-based net income or income from operations or operating cash flows.  Further, because not all companies use identical calculations, amounts reflected by us as Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Management believes the information shown below is relevant as it presents the amounts used to calculate covenants which are provided to our lenders.  Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in the requirement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under such agreements. 
    
  The reconciliation of Net (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and reconciliation of Net (Loss) to Credit Agreement Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and the twelve trailing months ("TTM") ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   follows:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Some accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. Such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, known trends in our industry, terms of existing contracts, and other information from outside sources, as appropriate. Management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on the facts and circumstances as of   September 30, 2016  , however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. 
  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates which are discussed in the  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  section of  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in Part II, Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, our most significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 and elsewhere in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 3. 
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Interest Rate Exposure 
  We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes as borrowings under the Senior Facilities bear interest at variable interest rates. It is our policy to enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives. 
  Based on our exposure to variable rate borrowings at   September 30, 2016  , after consideration of  our LIBOR floor rate and interest rate swap agreements, a one percent (1%) change in the weighted average interest rate for a period of one year would change the annual interest expense by approximately   $4.1 million  . 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange 
  We are exposed to foreign exchange rate changes of the Australian, Canadian, and Mexican currencies as they impact the   $141.5 million   tangible and intangible net asset value of our Australian, Canadian, and Mexican subsidiaries as of   September 30, 2016  . The foreign subsidiaries net tangible assets were   $70.6 million   and the net intangible assets were   $70.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  We utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage the exposure to currency fluctuations in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. Dollar.  See "  Note 9 - Derivatives and Hedging  " of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  Item 4. 
  Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of   September 30, 2016  , in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

EXHIBIT 99.1 

On June 30, 2014, affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC ( CCMP ) and Oak Hill Capital Partners III, L.P., Oak Hill Capital Management Partners III, L.P. and OHCP III HC RO, L.P.), together with certain current and former members of Hillman s management, consummated a merger transaction (the  Merger Transaction ) pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 16, 2014. 
    
  Hillman Group issued $330,000 aggregate principal amount of its senior notes due July 15, 2022 (the  6.375% Senior Notes ). The 6.375% Senior Notes, of which $330,000 aggregate principal amount was outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by The Hillman Companies, Inc., Hillman Investment Company, and certain of the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries. The non-guarantor information presented represents our Australian, Canadian, and Mexican subsidiaries. 
    
  The following financial information presents condensed consolidating statements of comprehensive income (loss), balance sheets, and cash flows for the Hillman Group, all guarantor subsidiaries, all non-guarantor subsidiaries, and the eliminations necessary to provide the consolidated results for the Hillman Companies and subsidiaries. For purposes of this presentation, we have accounted for investments in our subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting. The principal consolidating adjustments eliminate investment in subsidiary and intercompany balances and transactions.
