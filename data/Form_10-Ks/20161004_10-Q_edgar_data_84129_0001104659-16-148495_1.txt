                        the inability to complete the proposed acquisition (the  Merger ) of us by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( WBA ), due to the failure to satisfy the remaining conditions to the completion of the Merger, including receipt of required regulatory approvals;

   1. Basis of Presentation   
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and therefore do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete annual financial statements. The accompanying financial information reflects all adjustments which are of a recurring nature and, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. The results of operations for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Rite Aid Corporation ( Rite Aid ) and Subsidiaries (together with Rite Aid, the  Company ) Fiscal 2016 10-K.  
     
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605 Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The standard requires that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases, (Topic 842) , which is intended to improve financial reporting around leasing transactions. The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that engage in lease transactions (both lessee and lessor) that lease assets such as real estate and manufacturing equipment. This ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as  leases  to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is in process of assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation, (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which is intended to simplify aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The ASU simplifies the accounting of stock compensation, including income tax implications, the balance sheet classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the cash flow classification of employee share based payment transactions. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning December 15, 2016. Early adoption of all the amendments for ASU 2016-09 is permitted.  Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement must be applied prospectively. Amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively based on the Company s election. Amendments related to the statement of cash flows presentation of employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares must be applied retrospectively. The Company is in process of assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
     
   2. Acquisition   
     
  On June 24, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of TPG VI Envision BL, LLC and Envision Topco Holdings, LLC ( EnvisionRx ), pursuant to the terms of an agreement ( Agreement ) dated February 10, 2015 (the  Acquisition ).

  through Orchard Pharmaceutical Services; access to the nation s largest cash pay infertility discount drug program via Design Rx; an innovative claims adjudication software platform in Laker Software; and a national Medicare Part D prescription drug plan through Envision Insurance Company s ( EIC ) EnvisionRx Plus Silver product for the low income auto-assign market and its Clear Choice product for the chooser market. EnvisionRx is headquartered in Twinsburg, Ohio and operates as a 100 percent owned subsidiary of the Company.  
     
  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, as consideration for the Acquisition, the Company paid $1,882,211 in cash and issued 27,754 shares of Rite Aid common stock. The Company financed the cash portion of the Acquisition with borrowings under its Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, and the net proceeds from the April 2, 2015 issuance of $1,800,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due 2023 (the  6.125% Notes ). The consideration associated with the common stock was $240,907 based on a stock price of $8.68 per share, representing the closing price of the Company s common stock on the closing date of the Acquisition.  
     
  The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 includes EnvisionRx results of operations. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015 include EnvisionRx results of operations from the Acquisition date of June 24, 2015 through August 29, 2015 (please see Note 13 Segment Reporting for the Pharmacy Services segment results included within the condensed consolidated financial statements for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, which reflects the results of EnvisionRx). The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the final purchase accounting adjustments in accordance with ASC 805  Business Combinations , whereby the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the Acquisition date.  
     
  The following allocation of the purchase price is final:  

(1)                                    Intangible assets are recorded at estimated fair value, as determined by management based on available information which includes a final valuation prepared by an independent third party. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets were determined through the use of the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty and the multi-period excess earnings methods. The major assumptions used in arriving at the estimated identifiable intangible asset values included management s estimates of future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate rate of return which are based on the weighted average cost of capital for both the Company and other market participants, projected customer attrition rates, as well as applicable royalty rates for comparable assets. The useful lives for intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining useful economic lives of the intangible assets that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows. The estimated fair value of intangible assets and related useful lives as included in the final purchase price allocation include:

(2)                                    Other current liabilities includes $116,057 due to TPG under the terms of the Agreement, representing the amounts due to EnvisionRx from CMS, less corresponding amounts due to various reinsurance providers under certain reinsurance programs, for CMS activities that relate to the year ended December 31, 2014. This liability was satisfied with a payment to TPG on November 5, 2015. 
     
  (3)                                    Primarily relates to deferred tax liabilities. 
     
  The above goodwill represents future economic benefits expected to be recognized from the Company s expansion into the pharmacy services market, as well as expected future synergies and operating efficiencies from combining operations with EnvisionRx. Goodwill resulting from the Acquisition of $1,639,355 has been allocated to the Pharmacy Services segment of which $1,368,657 is deductible for tax purposes.  
     
  During the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016, $6 of costs related to the Acquisition were expensed by the Company as incurred.  During the thirteen and twenty-six weeks periods ended August 29, 2015, acquisition costs of $9,613 and $27,072, respectively, were expensed as incurred. The following unaudited pro forma combined financial data gives effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred as of March 1, 2014. 
     
  These unaudited pro forma combined results have been prepared by combining the historical results of the Company and historical results of EnvisionRx. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data for all periods presented were adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that 1) are directly attributable to the aforementioned transaction, 2) factually supportable, and 3) expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results of operations. Specifically, these adjustments reflect:  
     
                        Incremental interest expense relating to the $1,800,000 6.125% Notes issued on April 2, 2015, the net proceeds of which were used to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition. 
     
                        Incremental amortization resulting from increased fair value of the identifiable intangible assets as noted in the final purchase price allocation. 
     
                        Removal of costs incurred in connection with the Acquisition by both the Company and EnvisionRx, including bridge loan commitment fees of $15,375. 
     
                        Removal of interest expense incurred by EnvisionRx as the underlying debt was repaid upon the acquisition date. 
     
                        Removal of debt extinguishment charges incurred by EnvisionRx. 
     
                        Inclusion of the 27,754 shares of Rite Aid common stock issued to fund the stock portion of the purchase price in the basic and diluted share calculation. 
     
  The unaudited pro forma combined information is not necessarily indicative of what the combined company s results actually would have been had the Acquisition been completed as of the beginning of the periods as indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma combined information does not purport to project the future results of the combined company.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 is identical to the actual results reported by the Company because EnvisionRx results were included in the consolidated operations of the Company for the entire period.  
     
   3. Pending Merger   
     
  On October 27, 2015, Rite Aid entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with WBA, and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of WBA ( Victoria Merger Sub ). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Victoria Merger Sub will merge with and into Rite Aid (the  Merger ), with Rite Aid surviving the Merger as a 100 percent owned direct subsidiary of WBA. On February 4, 2016, the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement was approved by approximately 97% of the votes cast at the special meeting, which represented approximately 72% of the Company s total outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of the record date of the special meeting. A quorum of 74% of the Company s total outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date voted at the special meeting. Completion of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including but not limited to (i) the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (ii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the Merger, and (iii) the absence of a material adverse effect on Rite Aid, as defined in the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of Rite Aid s common stock, par value $1.00 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares owned by (i) WBA, Victoria Merger Sub or Rite Aid (which will be cancelled), (ii) stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law, or (iii) any direct or indirect 100 percent owned subsidiary of Rite Aid or WBA (which will be converted into shares of common stock of the surviving corporation)) will be converted into the right to receive $9.00 per share in cash, without interest.  
     
  Rite Aid and WBA and Victoria Merger Sub have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, that (i) Rite Aid and its subsidiaries will continue to conduct our business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger and (ii) Rite Aid will not solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions to the Merger or engage in discussions or negotiations with respect thereto, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, the Merger Agreement limits the Company s ability to incur indebtedness for borrowed money and issue additional capital stock, among other things. The Company continues to believe that the transaction will close in the second half of calendar year 2016.

   4. Income Per Share   
     
  Basic income per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the income of the Company subject to anti-dilution limitations.  

Due to their antidilutive effect, 3,351 and 2,893 potential common shares related to stock options have been excluded from the computation of diluted income per share as of August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively.  
     
  During the May 2015, $64,089 of the Company s 8.5% convertible notes due 2015 were converted into 24,762 shares of common stock, pursuant to their terms.  
     
  5 . Lease Termination and Impairment Charges   
     
  Lease termination and impairment charges consist of amounts as follows:  

Impairment Charges   
     
  These amounts include the write-down of long-lived assets at locations that were assessed for impairment because of management s intention to relocate or close the location or because of changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.  
     
   Lease Termination Charges   
     
  As part of the Company s ongoing business activities, the Company assesses stores and distribution centers for potential closure or relocation. Decisions to close or relocate stores or distribution centers in future periods would result in lease termination charges, lease exit costs and inventory liquidation charges, as well as impairment of assets at these locations. The following table reflects the closed store and distribution center charges that relate to new closures, changes in assumptions and interest accretion:

   6. Fair Value Measurements   
     
  The Company utilizes the three-level valuation hierarchy for the recognition and disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization of assets and liabilities within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy consist of the following:  
     
                        Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
     
                        Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the instrument. 
     
                        Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based upon management s best estimate of inputs market participants could use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk. 
     
   Non-Financial Assets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis   
     
  Long-lived non-financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for purposes of calculating impairment using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of long-lived assets using Level 2 inputs is determined by evaluating the current economic conditions in the geographic area for similar use assets. The fair value of long-lived assets using Level 3 inputs is determined by estimating the amount and timing of net future cash flows (which are unobservable inputs) and discounting them using a risk-adjusted rate of interest (which is Level 1). The Company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the store is located. Significant increases or decreases in actual cash flows may result in valuation changes. During the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016, long-lived assets from continuing operations with a carrying value of $2,577, primarily store assets, were written down to their fair value of $1,880, resulting in an impairment charge of $697 of which $78 relates to the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016. During the twenty-six week period ended August 29, 2015, long-lived assets from continuing operations with a carrying value of $2,193, primarily store assets, were written down to their fair value of $1,915, resulting in an impairment charge of $278 of which $5 relates to the thirteen-week period ended August 29, 2015. If our actual future cash flows differ from our projections materially, certain stores that are either not impaired or partially impaired in the current period may be further impaired in future periods.  
     
  The following table presents fair values for those assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015:  
     
   Fair Value Measurement Using   

As of August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, the Company did not have any financial assets measured on a recurring basis.

Table of Contents   
     
   Other Financial Instruments   
     
  Financial instruments other than long-term indebtedness include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. These instruments are recorded at book value, which we believe approximate their fair values due to their short term nature.  In addition, the Company has $6,201 of investments, carried at amortized cost as these investments are being held to maturity, which are included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets as of August 27, 2016.  The Company believes the carrying value of these investments approximates their fair value.  
     
  The fair value for LIBOR-based borrowings under the Company s senior secured credit facility and first and second lien term loans are estimated based on the quoted market price of the financial instrument which is considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of substantially all of the Company s other long-term indebtedness are estimated based on quoted market prices of the financial instruments which are considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company s total long-term indebtedness was $7,173,746 and $7,584,402, respectively, as of August 27, 2016. There were no outstanding derivative financial instruments as of August 27, 2016 and February 27, 2016.  
     
   7. Income Taxes   
     
  The Company recorded an income tax expense of $10,928 and $16,463 for the thirteen week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively, and an income tax expense of $4,619 and $28,904 for the twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively.  The income tax expense for the thirteen weeks ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 was based on an estimated effective tax rate of 42.5% and 43.4%, respectively.  The income tax expense for the twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 was based on an estimated effective tax rate of 31.2% and 41.8%, respectively.   The lower effective income tax expense rate for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 is the result of a discrete income tax benefit recorded for the lapse of a statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position which lowered the Company s effective income tax expense rate by 8.9%. 
     
  The Company recognizes tax liabilities in accordance with the guidance for uncertain tax positions and management adjusts these liabilities with changes in judgment as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities.  
     
  While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months, the Company does not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.  
     
  The Company regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain.  Management will continue to monitor all available evidence related to the net deferred tax assets that may change the most recent assessment, including events that have occurred or are anticipated to occur. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $211,919 and $212,023, which relates primarily to state deferred tax assets at August 27, 2016 and February 27, 2016, respectively.  
     
   8. Medicare Part D   
     
  The Company offers Medicare Part D benefits through EIC, which has contracted with CMS to be a Prescription Drug Plan ( PDP ) and, pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, must be a risk-bearing entity regulated under state insurance laws or similar statutes.  
     
  EIC is a licensed domestic insurance company under the applicable laws and regulations. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, EIC must file quarterly and annual reports with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) and certain state regulators, must maintain certain minimum amounts of capital and surplus under formulas established by certain states and must, in certain circumstances, request and receive the approval of certain state regulators before making dividend payments or other capital distributions to the Company. The Company does not believe these limitations on dividends and distributions materially impact its financial position. EIC is subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements in certain states. The minimum amount of capital and surplus required to satisfy regulatory requirements in these states is $26,618 as of June 30, 2016. EIC was in excess of the minimum required amounts in these states as of August 27, 2016.  
     
  The Company has recorded estimates of various assets and liabilities arising from its participation in the Medicare Part D program based on information in its claims management and enrollment systems. Significant estimates arising from its participation in this program include: (i) estimates of low-income cost subsidies, reinsurance amounts, and coverage gap discount amounts ultimately payable to CMS based on a detailed claims reconciliation that will occur in the following year; (ii) an estimate of amounts receivable from CMS under a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design, referred to as the risk corridor and (iii) estimates for

  claims that have been reported and are in the process of being paid or contested and for our estimate of claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported.  
     
  As of August 27, 2016, accounts receivable, net included $379,533 due from CMS and accrued salaries, wages and other current liabilities included $179,765 of EIC liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts.  As of February 27, 2016, accounts receivable, net included $275,032 due from CMS and accrued salaries, wages and other current liabilities included $166,238 of EIC liabilities under certain reinsurance contracts. EIC limits its exposure to loss and recovers a portion of benefits paid by utilizing quota-share reinsurance with a commercial reinsurance company. 
     
   9   . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
     
  Goodwill and indefinitely-lived assets, such as certain trademarks acquired in connection with acquisition transactions, are not amortized, but are instead evaluated for impairment on an annual basis at the end of the fiscal year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may be more likely. During the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and the fifty-two week period ended February 27, 2016, no impairment charges have been taken against the Company s goodwill or indefinitely-lived intangible assets.  Below is a summary of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016:

  The Company s intangible assets are finite-lived and amortized over their useful lives. Following is a summary of the Company s finite-lived and indefinitely-lived intangible assets as of August 27, 2016 and February 27, 2016.  

(a)                                        Amortized on an accelerated basis which is determined based on the remaining useful economic lives of the customer relationships that are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows.  
     
  Also included in other non-current liabilities as of August 27, 2016 and February 27, 2016 are unfavorable lease intangibles with a net carrying amount of $43,746 and $46,947, respectively. These intangible liabilities are amortized over their remaining lease terms at the time of acquisition.  
     
  Amortization expense for these intangible assets and liabilities was $55,409 and $110,912 for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016, respectively. Amortization expense for these intangible assets and liabilities was $48,609 and $80,550 for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015, respectively. The anticipated annual amortization expense for these intangible assets and liabilities is 2017 $216,319; 2018 $174,705; 2019 $137,295; 2020 $107,707 and 2021 $74,994.

Table of Contents   

Credit Facility   
     
  The Company s senior secured credit facility ( Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility  or  revolver ) has a borrowing capacity of $3,700,000 and matures in January 2020. Borrowings under the revolver bear interest at a rate per annum between (i) LIBOR plus 1.50% and LIBOR plus 2.00% with respect to Eurodollar borrowings and (ii) the alternate base rate plus 0.50% and the alternate base rate plus 1.00% with respect to ABR borrowings, in each case, based upon the average revolver availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility). The Company is required to pay fees between 0.250% and 0.375% per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolver, depending on the Average Revolver Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility). Amounts drawn under the revolver become due and payable on January 13, 2020.  
     
  The Company s ability to borrow under the revolver is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of accounts receivable, inventory and prescription files. At August 27, 2016, the Company had $2,350,000 of borrowings outstanding under the revolver and had letters of credit outstanding against the revolver of $67,787, which resulted in additional borrowing capacity of $1,282,213. The Merger Agreement contains a requirement that the Company s borrowings under the revolver not exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.  
     
  The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility restricts the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined herein) from accumulating cash on hand, and under certain circumstances, requires the funds in the Company s deposit accounts to be applied first to the repayment of outstanding revolving loans under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility and then to be held as collateral for the senior obligations.  
     
  The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility allows the Company to have outstanding, at any time, up to $1,500,000 in secured second priority debt, split-priority term loan debt, unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock in addition to borrowings under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility and existing indebtedness, provided that not in excess of $750,000 of such secured second priority debt, split-priority term loan debt, unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock shall mature or require scheduled payments of principal prior to 90 days after the latest of (a) the fifth anniversary of the effectiveness of the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility and (b) the latest maturity date of any Term Loan or Other Revolving Loan (each as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility) (excluding bridge facilities allowing extensions on customary terms to at least the date that is 90 days after such date and, with respect to any escrow notes issued by Rite Aid, excluding any special mandatory redemption of the type described in clause (iii) of the definition of  Escrow Notes  in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility). Subject to the limitations described in clauses (a) and (b) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility additionally allows the Company to issue or incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock so long as a Financial Covenant Effectiveness Period (as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility) is not in effect; provided, however, that certain of the Company s other outstanding indebtedness limits the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of incurrence or other exemptions are not available. The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility also contains certain restrictions on the amount of secured first priority debt the Company is able to incur. The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility also allows for the voluntary repurchase of any debt or other convertible debt, so long as the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility is not in default and the Company maintains availability under its revolving credit facility of more than $365,000.  
     
  The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility has a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 (a) on any date on which availability under the revolving credit facility is less than $200,000 or (b) on the third consecutive business day on which availability under the revolving credit facility is less than $250,000 and, in each case, ending on and excluding the first day thereafter, if any, which is the 30th consecutive calendar day on which availability under the revolving credit facility is equal to or greater than $250,000. As of August 27, 2016, the availability was  
     
 19   

Table of Contents   
     
  at a level that did not trigger this covenant. The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility also contains covenants which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt, the payments of dividends, sale of assets, mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens.  
     
  The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility also provides for customary events of default.  
     
  The Company also has two second priority secured term loan facilities. The first includes a $470,000 second priority secured term loan (the  Tranche 1 Term Loan ). The Tranche 1 Term Loan matures on August 21, 2020 and currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 4.75% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, if the Company chooses to make LIBOR borrowings, or at Citibank s base rate plus 3.75%. The second includes a $500,000 second priority secured term loan (the  Tranche 2 Term Loan ). The Tranche 2 Term Loan matures on June 21, 2021 and currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.875% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, if the Company chooses to make LIBOR borrowings, or at Citibank s base rate plus 2.875%.  
     
  With the exception of EIC, substantially all of Rite Aid Corporation s 100 percent owned subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, second priority secured term loan facilities, and unsecured guaranteed notes. The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility and second priority secured term loan facilities are secured, on a senior or second priority basis, as applicable, by a lien on, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and prescription files of the Subsidiary Guarantors. The subsidiary guarantees related to the Company s Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility and second priority secured term loan facilities and, on an unsecured basis, the unsecured guaranteed notes, are full and unconditional and joint and several, and there are no restrictions on the ability of the Company to obtain funds from its subsidiaries. The Company has no independent assets or operations. Additionally, prior to the Acquisition, the subsidiaries, including joint ventures, that did not guarantee the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, the credit facility, second priority secured term loan facilities and applicable notes, were minor. Accordingly, condensed consolidating financial information for the Company and subsidiaries is not presented for those periods. Subsequent to the Acquisition, other than EIC, the subsidiaries, including joint ventures, that do not guarantee the credit facility, second priority secured term loan facilities and applicable notes, are minor. As such, condensed consolidating financial information for the Company, its guaranteeing subsidiaries and non-guaranteeing subsidiaries is presented for those periods subsequent to the Acquisition. See Note 16  Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Information  for additional disclosure.  
     
   Other Transactions   
     
  On April 2, 2015, the Company issued $1,800,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% Notes, the net proceeds of which, along with other available cash and borrowings under its Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, were used to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition. The Company s obligations under the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsubordinated basis, by all of its subsidiaries that guarantee the Company s obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, second priority secured term loan facilities, the 9.25% senior notes due 2020 (the  9.25% Notes ) and the 6.75% senior notes due 2021 (the  6.75% Notes ) (the  Rite Aid Subsidiary Guarantors ), including EnvisionRx and certain of its domestic subsidiaries other than, among others, EIC (the  EnvisionRx Subsidiary Guarantors  and, together with the Rite Aid Subsidiary Guarantors, the  Subsidiary Guarantors ). The guarantees are unsecured. The 6.125% Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all of its other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness.  
     
  During May 2015, $64,089 of the Company s 8.5% convertible notes due 2015 were converted into 24,762 shares of common stock, pursuant to their terms. The remaining $79 of the Company s 8.5% convertible notes due 2015 were repaid by the Company upon maturity.  
     
  On August 15, 2015, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding $650,000 aggregate principal amount of its 8.00% Notes. In connection with the redemption, the Company recorded a loss on debt retirement, including call premium and unamortized debt issue costs, of $33,205 during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  
     
   Maturities   
     
  The aggregate annual principal payments of long-term debt for the remainder of fiscal 2017 and thereafter are as follows: 2017 $90; 2018  2019  2020 $2,350,000; 2021 $1,372,000 and $3,533,000 thereafter.

Operating results for the twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 include $23,696 and $16,201, respectively, of compensation costs related to the Company s stock-based compensation arrangements.  
     
  Beginning in fiscal 2015, the Company provided certain of its associates with performance based incentive plans under which the associates will receive a certain number of shares of the Company s common stock based on the Company meeting certain financial and performance goals. During the twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, the Company incurred $9,112 and $4,413 related to these performance based incentive plans, respectively, which is recorded as a component of stock-based compensation expense.  
     
  The total number and type of newly awarded grants and the related weighted average fair value for the twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 are as follows:  

Typically, stock options granted vest, and are subsequently exercisable in equal annual installments over a four-year period for employees. Restricted stock awards typically vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period.  
     
  The Company calculates the fair value of stock options using the Black- Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The following assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model:  

As of August 27, 2016, the total unrecognized pre-tax compensation costs related to unvested stock options and restricted stock awards granted, net of estimated forfeitures and the weighted average period of cost amortization are as follows:

  fiscal 2017, the Company expects to contribute $754 to the Nonqualified Executive Retirement Plans and $0 to the Defined Benefit Pension Plan.  
     
   14. Segment Reporting   
     
  Prior to June 24, 2015, the Company s operations were within one reportable segment. As a result of the completion of the Acquisition, the Company has realigned its internal management reporting to reflect two reportable segments, its retail drug stores ( Retail Pharmacy ), and its pharmacy services ( Pharmacy Services ) segments.  
     
  The Retail Pharmacy segment s primary business is the sale of prescription drugs and related consultation to its customers. Additionally, the Retail Pharmacy segment sells a full selection of health and beauty aids and personal care products, seasonal merchandise and a large private brand product line. The Pharmacy Services segment offers a full range of pharmacy benefit management services including plan design and administration, on both a transparent pass-through model and traditional model, formulary management and claims processing. Additionally, the Pharmacy Services segment offers specialty and mail order services, infertility treatment, and drug benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the federal government s Medicare Part D program.  
     
  The Parent Company s chief operating decision makers are its Parent Company Chief Executive Officer, Parent Company President and CEO Retail Pharmacy, CEO Pharmacy Services, Chief Financial Officer and its Senior Executive Vice Presidents (collectively the  CODM ). The CODM has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions. The CODM determines, in particular, resource allocation for, and monitors performance of, the consolidated enterprise, the Retail Pharmacy segment and the Pharmacy Services segment. The Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segment managers have responsibility for operating decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance within their respective segments. The CODM relies on internal management reporting that analyzes enterprise results on certain key performance indicators, namely, revenues, gross profit, and Adjusted EBITDA.  
     
  The following table is a reconciliation of the Company s business segments to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015:  

(1)                                    Intersegment eliminations include intersegment revenues and corresponding cost of revenues that occur when Pharmacy Services segment customers use Retail Pharmacy segment stores to purchase covered products. When this occurs, both the Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments record the revenue on a stand-alone basis.

   15. Commitments and Contingencies   
     
    Legal Matters    
     
  The Company is a party to legal proceedings, investigations and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including the matters described below. The Company records accruals for outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability.  
     
  The Company s contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties, including, among other factors: (i) proceedings are in early stages; (ii) whether class or collective action status is sought and the likelihood of a class being certified; (iii) the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (iv) the extent of potential damages, fines or penalties, which are often unspecified or indeterminate; (v) the impact of discovery on the matter; (vi) whether novel or unsettled legal theories are at issue; (vii) there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and/or (viii) in the case of certain government agency investigations, whether a sealed qui tam lawsuit ( whistleblower  action) has been filed and whether the government agency makes a decision to intervene in the lawsuit following investigation.  
     
  As of August 27, 2016, the Company was aware of ten (10) putative class action lawsuits that were filed by purported Company stockholders, against the Company, its directors (the Individual Defendants, together with the Company, the Rite Aid Defendants), Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA) and Victoria Merger Sub Inc., (Victoria) challenging the transactions contemplated by the Merger agreement between the Company and WBA. Eight (8) of these actions were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware ( Smukler v. Rite Aid Corp., et al. ,  Hirschler v. Standley, et al. ,  Catelli v. Rite Aid Corp., et al. ,  Orr v. Rite Aid Corp., et al. ,  DePietro v. Standley, et al. ,  Abadi v. Rite Aid Corp., et al. ,  Mortman v. Rite Aid Corp., et al. ). One (1) action  
     
 24   

Table of Contents   
     
  was filed in Pennsylvania in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County ( Wilson v. Rite Aid Corp., et al. ,  Sachs Investment Grp., et al. v. Standley, et al. ). The complaints in these nine (9) actions alleged primarily that the Company s directors breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, agreeing to an allegedly unfair and inadequate price, agreeing to deal protection devices that allegedly prevented the directors from obtaining higher offers from other interested buyers for the Company and allegedly failing to protect against certain purported conflicts of interest in connection with the Merger. The Complaints further allege that the Company, WBA and/or Victoria aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The complaints sought, among other things, to enjoin the closing of the Merger as well as money damages and attorneys  and experts  fees.  
     
  On December 23, 2015, the eight (8) Delaware actions were consolidated in an action captioned  In re Rite Aid Corporation Stockholders Litigation,  Consol. C.A. No. 11663-CB (the Consolidated Action). In addition to the claims asserted in the nine (9) complaints discussed above, the operative pleading in the Consolidated Action also included allegations that the preliminary proxy statement contained material omissions, including with respect to the process that resulted in the Merger agreement and the fairness opinion rendered by the Company s banker. On December 28, 2015, the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Action filed a motion for expedited proceedings, which the Court orally denied at a hearing held on January 5, 2016. On March 11, 2016, the Court granted the plaintiffs  notice and proposed order voluntarily dismissing the Consolidated Action as moot, while retaining jurisdiction solely for the purpose of adjudicating plaintiffs  counsel s anticipated application for an award of attorneys  fees and reimbursement of expenses. On April 15, 2016, the Company reached a settlement in principle related to this matter for an immaterial amount and on May 11, 2016, the Court entered a stipulated order regarding notice of payment thereof and final dismissal of this matter.  
     
  A tenth action was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the Pennsylvania District Court), asserting a claim for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 against all defendants and a claim for violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Individual Defendants and WBA ( Herring v. Rite Aid Corp., et al. ). The  Herring  complaint alleges, among other things, that Rite Aid and its Board of Directors disseminated an allegedly false and materially misleading proxy. The complaint sought to enjoin the shareholder vote on the proposed Merger, a declaration that the proxy was materially false and misleading in violation of federal securities laws, and an award of money damages and attorneys  and experts  fees. On January 14 and 16, 2016, respectively, the plaintiff in the Herring action filed a motion for preliminary injunction and a motion for expedited discovery. On January 21, 2016, the Rite Aid Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Herring complaint. At a hearing held on January 25, 2016, the Pennsylvania District Court orally denied the plaintiff s motion for expedited discovery and subsequently denied the plaintiff s motion for preliminary injunction on January 28, 2016. On March 14, 2016, the Pennsylvania District Court appointed Jerry Herring, Don Michael Hussey and Joanna Pauli Hussey as lead plaintiffs for the putative class and approved their selection of Robbins Geller Rudman   Dowd LLP as lead counsel. On April 14, 2016, the Pennsylvania District Court granted the plaintiffs  unopposed motion to stay the  Herring  action for all purposes pending consummation of the Merger.  
     
  The Company has been named in a collective and class action lawsuit,  Indergit v. Rite Aid Corporation et al.  pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, filed purportedly on behalf of current and former store managers working in the Company s stores at various locations around the country. The lawsuit alleges that the Company failed to pay overtime to store managers as required under the FLSA and under certain New York state statutes. The lawsuit also seeks other relief, including liquidated damages, attorneys  fees, costs and injunctive relief arising out of state and federal claims for overtime pay. On April 2, 2010, the Court conditionally certified a nationwide collective group of individuals who worked for the Company as store managers since March 31, 2007. The Court ordered that Notice of the  Indergit  action be sent to the purported members of the collective group (approximately 7,000 current and former store managers) and approximately 1,550 joined the  Indergit  action. Discovery as to certification issues has been completed. On September 26, 2013, the Court granted Rule 23 class certification of the New York store manager claims as to liability only, but denied it as to damages, and denied the Company s motion for decertification of the nationwide collective action claims. The Company filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the Court s September 26, 2013 decision which motion was denied in June 2014. The Company subsequently filed a petition for an interlocutory appeal of the Court s September 26, 2013 ruling with the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which petition was denied in September 2014. Notice of the Rule 23 class certification as to liability only has been sent to approximately 1,750 current and former store managers in the state of New York. Discovery related to the merits of the claims is ongoing. At this time, the Company is not able to either predict the outcome of this lawsuit or estimate a potential range of loss with respect to the lawsuit. The Company s management believes, however, that this lawsuit is without merit and is vigorously defending this lawsuit.  
     
  The Company is currently a defendant in several lawsuits filed in state courts in California alleging violations of California wage and hour laws, rules and regulations pertaining primarily to failure to pay overtime, failure to pay for missed meals and rest periods, failure to reimburse business expenses and failure to provide employee seating (the  California Cases ). The lawsuits pertaining to failure to reimburse business expenses and provide employee seating purport to be class actions and seek substantial damages. The single-plaintiff and multi-plaintiff lawsuits regarding failure to pay overtime and failure to pay for missed meals and rest periods, in the aggregate, seek substantial damages. The Company has aggressively challenged the merits of the lawsuits and, where applicable, the allegations that the cases should be certified as class or representative actions.

Table of Contents   
     
  In the employee seating case ( Hall v. Rite Aid Corporation, San Diego County Superior Court ), the Court, in October 2011, granted the plaintiff s motion for class certification. The Company filed its motion for decertification, which motion was granted in November 2012. Plaintiff subsequently appealed the Court s order which appeal was granted in May 2014. The Company filed a petition for review of the appellate court s decision with the California Supreme Court, which petition was denied in August 2014. Proceedings in the  Hall  case were stayed pending a decision by the California Supreme Court in two similar cases. That decision was rendered on April 4, 2016.  A status conference in the case is scheduled for November 18, 2016. With respect to the California Cases, the Company, at this time, is not able to predict either the outcome of these lawsuits or estimate a potential range of loss with respect to said lawsuits.  
     
  The Company was served with a Civil Investigative Demand Subpoena Duces Tecum dated August 26, 2011 by the United States Attorney s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan. The subpoena requests records regarding the relationship of Rite Aid s Rx Savings Program to the reporting of usual and customary charges to publicly funded health programs. In connection with the same investigation, the Company was served with a Civil Subpoena Duces Tecum dated February 22, 2013 by the State of Indiana Office of the Attorney General requesting additional information regarding both Rite Aid s Rx Savings Program and usual and customary charges. The Company has responded to both of the subpoenas. To enable the parties to discuss a possible resolution, the Medicaid Fraud Control Units of the several states, commonwealths and the District of Columbia and Rite Aid have entered into an agreement tolling the statute of limitations until October 7, 2015. The parties agreed to extend the tolling agreement until April 7, 2016.  The parties anticipate exchanging pertinent claims data in the near future.  At this stage of the proceedings, Rite Aid is unable to predict the outcome of any review by the government of such information and the outcome of the parties  discussions of a possible resolution.  
     
  On April 26, 2012, the Company received an administrative subpoena from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ), Albany, New York District Office, requesting information regarding the Company s sale of products containing pseudoephedrine ( PSE ). In April 2012, it also received a communication from the U.S. Attorney s Office ( USAO ) for the Northern District of New York concerning an investigation of possible civil violations of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 ( CMEA ). Additional subpoenas were issued in 2013, 2014, and 2015 seeking broader documentation regarding PSE sales and recordkeeping requirements. Assistant U.S. Attorneys from the Northern and Eastern Districts of New York and the Southern District of West Virginia are currently investigating, but no charges have been filed.  Between September 2015 and August 2016, the Company received several grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia seeking additional information in connection with the investigation of violations of the CMEA and/or the Controlled Substances Act ( CSA ). Violations of the CMEA or the CSA could result in the imposition of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties against the Company. The Company is cooperating with the government and continues to provide information responsive to the subpoenas. The Company has entered into a tolling agreement with the USAOs in the Northern and Eastern Districts of New York and entered into a separate tolling agreement with the USAO in the Southern District of West Virginia. Discussions are underway to resolve these matters with those USAOs, but whether an agreement can be reached and on what terms is uncertain. While the Company s management cannot predict the outcome of these matters, it is possible that the Company s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution. At this stage of the investigation, Rite Aid is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation.  
     
  In January 2013, the DEA, Los Angeles District Office, served an administrative subpoena on the Company seeking documents related to prescriptions by a certain prescriber. The USAO, Central District of California, also contacted the Company about a related investigation into allegations that Rite Aid pharmacies filled certain controlled substance prescriptions for a number of practitioners after their DEA registrations had expired or otherwise become invalid in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and DEA regulations. The Company responded to the administrative subpoena and subsequent informal requests for information from the USAO. The Company met with the USAO and DEA in January 2014 and is involved in ongoing discussions with the government regarding this matter. The Company has entered into a tolling agreement with the USAO. The Company recorded a legal accrual during the period ended March 1, 2014, which was revised during the period ending August 29, 2015. However, Rite Aid cannot predict at this time whether an agreement can be reached and the terms of any agreement.  
     
  The Company was served with a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) dated June 21, 2013 by the USAO for the Eastern District of California and the Attorney General s Office of the State of California (the  AG ). The CID requested records and responses to interrogatories regarding Rite Aid s Drug Utilization Review and prescription dispensing protocol and the dispensing of drugs designated  Code 1  by the State of California. The Company produced responsive documents and interrogatory responses to the USAO and AG.  The Company produced documents in response to the CID and exchanged position letters with the USAO and AG concerning the merits of the government s claims.  Discussions with the government are ongoing in an effort to resolve these issues, but whether an agreement can be reached and on what terms is uncertain.  
     
  Relator, Matthew Omlansky, filed a  qui tam  action, State of California ex rel. Matthew Omlansky v. Rite Aid Corporation, on behalf of the State of California against Rite Aid in the Superior Court of the State of California.  In his Complaint, Relator alleges  
     
 26   

Table of Contents   
     
  that Rite Aid violated the California False Claims Act by (i) failing to comply with California rules governing the Company s reporting of its usual and customary prices; (ii) failing to dispense the least expensive equivalent generic drug in certain circumstances, in violation of applicable regulations; and (iii) dispensing, and seeking reimbursement for, restricted brand name drugs without prior approval.  Relator filed his Second Amended Complaint on April 19, 2016 and Rite Aid filed its demurrer on July 29, 2016.  At this stage of the proceedings, Rite Aid is unable to predict the outcome of its demurrer and Relator s suit.  
     
  In addition to the above described matters, the Company is subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits and governmental investigations arising in the ordinary course of business. While the Company s management cannot predict the outcome of any of the claims, the Company s management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will be material to the Company s consolidated financial position. It is possible, however, that the Company s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of pending litigation or contingencies.  
     
   16. Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Information   
     
  Rite Aid Corporation conducts the majority of its business through its subsidiaries. With the exception of EIC, substantially all of Rite Aid Corporation s 100 percent owned subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, second priority secured term loan facilities, secured guaranteed notes and unsecured guaranteed notes (the  Subsidiary Guarantors ). Additionally, prior to the Acquisition, the subsidiaries, including joint ventures, that did not guarantee the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, second priority secured term loan facilities, secured guaranteed notes and unsecured guaranteed notes, were minor. Accordingly, condensed consolidating financial information for the Company and subsidiaries is not presented for those periods. Condensed consolidating financial information for the Company, its Subsidiary Guarantors and non-guarantor subsidiaries, is presented for periods subsequent to the Acquisition.  
     
  For the purposes of preparing the information below, Rite Aid Corporation uses the equity method to account for its investment in subsidiaries. The equity method has been used by Subsidiary Guarantors with respect to investments in the non-guarantor subsidiaries. The subsidiary guarantees related to the Company s Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, second priority secured term loan facilities and secured guaranteed notes and, on an unsecured basis, the unsecured guaranteed notes, are full and unconditional and joint and several. Presented below is condensed consolidating financial information for Rite Aid Corporation, the Subsidiary Guarantors, and the non-guarantor subsidiaries at August 27, 2016, February 27, 2016, and for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015. Separate financial statements for Subsidiary Guarantors are not presented.

   Pending Merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.   
     
  On October 27, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with WBA, and Victoria Merger Sub. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Victoria Merger Sub will merge with and into Rite Aid, with Rite Aid surviving the Merger as a 100 percent owned direct subsidiary of WBA. On February 4, 2016, the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement was approved by approximately 97% of the votes cast at the special meeting, representing approximately 72% of our total outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of the record date of the special meeting. A quorum of 74% of our total outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date voted at the special meeting. Completion of the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including but not limited to (i) the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (ii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the Merger, and (iii) the absence of a material adverse effect on us, as defined in the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares owned by (i) WBA, Victoria Merger Sub or Rite Aid (which will be cancelled), (ii) stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law, or (iii) any direct or indirect 100 percent owned subsidiary of Rite Aid or WBA (which will be converted into shares of common stock of the surviving corporation)) will be converted into the right to receive $9.00 per share in cash, without interest.  
     
  We, WBA and Victoria Merger Sub have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, that (i) we and our subsidiaries will continue to conduct our business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger and (ii) we will not solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions to the Merger or engage in discussions or negotiations with respect thereto, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, the Merger Agreement limits our ability to incur indebtedness for borrowed money and issue additional capital stock, among other things. We continue to believe that the transaction will close in the second half of calendar year 2016.  
     
   Overview of Financial Results   
     
   Net Income:    Our net income for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 was $14.8 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share and $10.2 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, respectively, compared to net income of $21.5 million or $0.02 per basic and diluted share and $40.3 million or $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015. The operating results for the thirteen and twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 include the operating results of EnvisionRx. The operating results for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015 include the operating results of EnvisionRx subsequent to the June 24, 2015 acquisition date. The decline in the thirteen and twenty-six week operating results was due primarily to a higher LIFO charge and decline in Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by a $33.2 million loss on debt retirement in the prior year related to the redemption of our 8.00% Notes. 
     
   Adjusted EBITDA:    Our adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 was $312.7 million or 3.9 percent of revenues and $598.7 million or 3.7 percent of revenues, respectively, compared to $346.8 million or 4.5 percent of revenues and $646.1 million or 4.5 percent of revenues for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015, respectively.  Adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 includes the Adjusted EBITDA of EnvisionRx. The Adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015 includes the Adjusted EBITDA of EnvisionRx subsequent to the June 24, 2015 acquisition date.  The decline in our Adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 was due primarily to a decrease of $51.0 million in the Retail Pharmacy segment resulting from lower gross profit and higher SG A expense. Gross profit declined due to lower pharmacy gross profit, partially offset by an increase in front end gross profit. Pharmacy gross profit decreased because of lower reimbursement rates and script count, partially offset by improvements in prescription drug costs. SG A expense increased due to a shift in the timing of Memorial Day holiday pay and increased benefit costs. The decline in Retail Pharmacy segment Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by an increase of $16.8 million of Pharmacy Services segment Adjusted EBITDA. This increase was due to strong operating results in the current year and the fact that prior year s Pharmacy Services segment results do not reflect a full quarter s ownership of EnvisionRx. 
     
  The decline in our Adjusted EBITDA for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 was due primarily to a decrease of $105.4 million in the Retail Pharmacy segment due to lower gross profit and higher SG A expense. Gross profit declined due to lower pharmacy gross profit, partially offset by an increase in front end gross profit. Pharmacy gross profit decreased because of lower reimbursement rates and script count. SG A expense increased due to higher payroll and benefit costs. The decline in Retail Pharmacy segment Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by an increase of $58.0 million of Pharmacy Services segment Adjusted EBITDA. This increase was due to strong operating results in the current year and the fact that prior year s Pharmacy Services segment results reflect EnvisionRx results beginning on the June 24, 2015 acquisition date.

   Gross Profit and Cost of Revenues   
     
  Gross profit decreased by $5.5 million for the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 compared to the thirteen week period ended August 29, 2015. Gross profit increased by $29.2 million for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 compared to the twenty-six week period ended August 29, 2015. Gross profit for the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 includes incremental gross profit of $35.6 million relating to our Pharmacy Services segment and a decline of $41.2 million in our Retail Pharmacy segment. Gross profit for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 includes incremental gross profit of $124.5 million relating to our Pharmacy Services segment and a decline of $95.3 million in our Retail Pharmacy segment. Gross margin was 23.9% and 23.5%, respectively for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 compared to 25.1% and 26.4%, respectively, for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015. The decrease in gross margin is due primarily to revenue growth in our Pharmacy Services segment, which carries a lower gross margin as a percentage of revenue, as well as lower reimbursement rates in the Retail Pharmacy segment that were not offset by improvements in prescription drug costs. Please see the section entitled  Segment Analysis  for a more detailed description of gross profit and gross margin results by segment.  
     
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   
     
  SG A increased $52.4 million and $146.1 million for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016, respectively, compared to the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015.  The increase in SG A includes an incremental increase of $22.7 million and $92.0 million, respectively, relating to our Pharmacy Services segment for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016, as well as an increase of $29.7 million and $54.0 million, respectively, relating to our Retail Pharmacy segment. The increase in our Retail Pharmacy segment SG A expense for the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 is due to a shift in the timing of Memorial Day holiday pay and increased benefit costs. The increase in SG A expense for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 is due to higher payroll and increased benefit costs. Please see the section entitled  Segment Analysis  below for additional details regarding SG A.  
     
   Lease Termination and Impairment Charges   
     
  Lease termination and impairment charges consist of amounts as follows:  

Impairment Charges:    These amounts include the write-down of long-lived assets at locations that were assessed for impairment because of management s intention to relocate or close the location or because of changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. 
     
  Please refer to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Impairment Charges  included in our Fiscal 2016 10-K for a detailed description of our impairment methodology.  
     
   Lease Termination Charges:    Charges to close a store, which principally consist of continuing lease obligations, are recorded at the time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated, pursuant to the guidance set forth in ASC 420,  Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.  We calculate our liability for closed stores on a store-by-store basis. The calculation includes the discounted effect of future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs, from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term, net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations. We evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly. As part of our ongoing business activities, we assess stores and distribution centers for potential closure and relocation. Decisions to close or relocate stores or distribution centers in future periods would result in lease termination charges for lease exit costs and liquidation of inventory, as well as impairment of assets at these locations. 
     
   Interest Expense   
     
  Interest expense was $105.4 million and $210.5 million for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016, respectively, compared to $115.4 million and $239.0 million for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest expense for the current period was primarily due to the prior year amortization of bridge loan commitment fees relating to the EnvisionRx acquisition and interest savings from our refinancing activities in the second quarter of last year. The weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness for the twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 were 5.3% and 5.5%, respectively.

   Income Taxes   
     
  We recorded an income tax expense of $10.9 million and $16.5 million for the thirteen week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively, and an income tax expense of $4.6 million and $28.9 million for the twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively.  The income tax expense for the thirteen weeks ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 was based on an estimated effective tax rate of 42.5% and 43.4%, respectively.  The income tax expense for the twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 was based on an estimated effective tax rate of 31.2% and 41.8%, respectively.   The lower effective income tax expense rate for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 is the result of a discrete income tax benefit recorded in the thirteen weeks ended May 28, 2016 for the lapse of a statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position which lowered the Company s effective income tax expense rate by 8.9%. 
     
  We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the guidance for uncertain tax positions and management adjusts these liabilities with changes in judgment as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities.  
     
  While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months, management does not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.  
     
  We regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain.  We will continue to monitor all available evidence related to the net deferred tax assets that may change the most recent assessment, including events that have occurred or are anticipated to occur. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $211.9 million and $212.0 million, which relates primarily to state deferred tax assets at August 27, 2016 and February 27, 2016, respectively.  
     
   Segment Analysis   
     
  We evaluate the Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments  performance based on revenue, gross profit, and Adjusted EBITDA.  The following is a reconciliation of our segments to the condensed consolidated financial statements:  

(1)                                    Intersegment eliminations include intersegment revenues and corresponding cost of revenues that occur when Pharmacy Services segment customers use Retail Pharmacy segment stores to purchase covered products. When this occurs, both the Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments record the revenue on a stand-alone basis.

   Revenues   
     
  Revenues decreased 2.4% for the thirteen weeks ended August 27, 2016 compared to an increase of 1.9% for the thirteen weeks ended August 29, 2015. The decrease in revenues for the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 was primarily a result of a decrease in pharmacy same store sales.  
     
  Pharmacy same store sales decreased by 3.6% for the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 compared to the 2.8% increase in the thirteen week period ended August 29, 2015. The decrease in the current period is due primarily to continued lower reimbursement rates, an approximate 1.0% negative impact from generic introductions, and a 1.8% decrease in same store prescription count which is, in part, due to our limited access to certain narrow networks.  
     
  Front-end same store sales increased 0.1% during the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016.  
     
  Revenues decreased 1.0% for the twenty-six weeks ended August 27, 2016 compared to an increase of 2.4% for the twenty-six weeks ended August 29, 2015. The decrease in revenues for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 was primarily a result of the decrease in pharmacy same store sales.  
     
  Pharmacy same store sales decreased by 1.8% for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 compared to the 3.4% increase in the twenty-six week period ended August 29, 2015. The decrease in the current period is due primarily to continued lower reimbursement rates, an approximate 1.5% negative impact from generic introductions, and a 0.6% decrease in same store prescription count.  
     
  Front-end same store sales increased by 0.7% during the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 compared to the 0.5% increase in the twenty-six week period ended August 29, 2015. The same store front-end sales were positively impacted by our continuing investment in our Wellness format stores.  
     
  We include in same store sales all stores that have been open at least one year. Relocation stores are not included in same store sales until one year has lapsed.

   Gross Profit and Cost of Revenues   
     
  Gross profit decreased $41.2 million for the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 as compared to the thirteen week period ended August 29, 2015.  Gross profit was negatively impacted by a decrease in pharmacy gross profit due to lower reimbursement rates and lower same store prescription count, partially offset by increased front-end gross profit.  
     
  Gross profit decreased $95.3 million for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 as compared to the twenty-six week period ended August 29, 2015. Gross profit was negatively impacted by a decrease in pharmacy gross profit due to lower reimbursement rates and lower same store prescription count, partially offset by increased front-end gross profit.  
     
  Gross margin was 28.1% and 27.5% of sales for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016, respectively, compared to 28.0% of sales for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015. Gross margin was flat for the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 compared to the thirteen week period ended August 29, 2015.   Pharmacy gross margin for the thirteen week period was lower due to reduced reimbursement rates and was offset by higher front end gross margin.  The decrease in gross margin for the twenty-six week period was due primarily to continued reimbursement rate pressures and a higher estimated LIFO charge. 
     
  We use the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method of inventory valuation, which is estimated on a quarterly basis and is finalized at year end when inflation rates and inventory levels are final. Therefore, LIFO costs for interim period financial statements are estimated. LIFO charges were $13.8 million and $27.5 million for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016, respectively, compared to $6.0 million and $12.0 million for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015, respectively.  The prior year s LIFO charge was lower than this year due to reductions in inventory balances in the prior year, which correspondingly reduced the prior year s charge. 
     
   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   
     
  SG A expenses as a percentage of revenues were 26.4% in the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 compared to 25.3% in the thirteen week period ended August 29, 2015. The increase in SG A as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the timing shift of Memorial Day holiday pay, increased benefit costs, and increased depreciation and amortization resulting from the incremental capital investment in our Wellness store remodel program.  
     
  SG A expenses as a percentage of revenues were 26.1% in the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 compared to 25.4% in the twenty-six week period ended August 29, 2015. The increase in SG A as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to salary and payroll related increases, higher occupancy costs, and increased depreciation and amortization related to our incremental capital investment in our Wellness store remodel program.  
     
   Pharmacy Services Segment Results of Operations   
     
   Acquisition of EnvisionRx   
     
  On June 24, 2015, we completed our acquisition of EnvisionRx, pursuant to the terms of the agreement ( Agreement ) dated February 10, 2015. EnvisionRx, our Pharmacy Services segment, is a full-service pharmacy benefit provider. EnvisionRx provides both transparent and traditional pharmacy benefit manager ( PBM ) options through its EnvisionRx and MedTrak PBMs,

  respectively. EnvisionRx also offers fully integrated mail-order and specialty pharmacy services through Orchard Pharmaceutical Services; access to the nation s largest cash pay infertility discount drug program via Design Rx; an innovative claims adjudication software platform in Laker Software; and a national Medicare Part D prescription drug plan through EIC s EnvisionRx Plus Silver product for the low income auto-assign market and its Clear Choice product for the chooser market. EnvisionRx operates as our 100 percent owned subsidiary. We believe that the acquisition of EnvisionRx will enable us to expand our retail healthcare platform and enhance our health and wellness offerings by combining EnvisionRx s broad suite of PBM and pharmacy-related businesses with our established retail platform to provide our customers and patients with an integrated offering across retail, specialty and mail-order channels.  
     
   Pharmacy Services Segment Results of Operations   
     
  Pharmacy Services segment revenue for the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 was $1,634.9 million compared to revenue of $1,071.9 million for the thirteen week ended August 29, 2015. Pharmacy Services segment revenue for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 was $3,237.2 million compared to revenue of $1,071.9 million for the twenty-six week period ended August 29, 2015. The increase in the thirteen and twenty-six week revenue for the segment is due to a full year of Pharmacy Services segment operations being included in the current year as compared to a partial year in the prior year. In addition, revenues for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 were positively impacted by early 2016 and mid-year 2015 customer additions.  
     
  Gross profit for the thirteen week period ended August 27, 2016 was $97.4 million as compared to gross profit of $61.8 million for the thirteen week period ended August 29, 2015. Gross profit for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 was $186.3 million as compared to gross profit of $61.8 million for the twenty-six week period ended August 29, 2015. The increase in the thirteen and twenty-six week gross profit for the segment is due to a full year of Pharmacy Services segment operating results being included in the current year as compared to a partial year in the prior year. In addition, gross profit for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 were positively impacted by customer additions.  
     
  Pharmacy Services segment selling, general and administrative expenses for the thirteen and twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 were $69.6 million and $139.0 million, respectively, as compared to $46.9 million of selling, general and administrative expenses for the thirteen and twenty-six week period ended August 29, 2015. Increases in the selling, general and administrative expenses for the current period are the result of a full period of operating results in fiscal 2017 as compared to a partial period of operating results in the prior year, as well as from additional costs to service new PBM customers.  
     
  Pharmacy Services Adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 was $50.0 million or 3.1 percent of Pharmacy Services revenue and $91.2 million or 2.8 percent of Pharmacy Services revenue, respectively, as compared to $33.2 million or 3.1 percent of Pharmacy Services revenue for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 29, 2015. The increase in the thirteen and twenty-six week Adjusted EBITDA for the segment is due to strong operating results in the current year and the fact that prior year s Pharmacy Services segment results do not reflect a full quarter s ownership of EnvisionRx.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
   General   
     
  We have two primary sources of liquidity: (i) cash provided by operating activities and (ii) borrowings under our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility. Our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations, to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt and to fund capital expenditures. Total liquidity as of August 27, 2016 was $1,297.8 million, which consisted of revolver borrowing capacity of $1,282.2 million and invested cash of $15.6 million.  
     
   Credit Facility   
     
  Our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility has a borrowing capacity of $3.7 billion and matures in January 2020.  Borrowings under the revolver bear interest at a rate per annum between (i) LIBOR plus 1.50% and LIBOR plus 2.00% with respect to Eurodollar borrowings and (ii) the alternate base rate plus 0.50% and the alternate base rate plus 1.00% with respect to ABR borrowings, in each case, based upon the average revolver availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility). We are required to pay fees between 0.250% and 0.375% per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolver, depending on the Average Revolver Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility). Amounts drawn under the revolver become due and payable on January 13, 2020.  
     
 40   

Table of Contents   
     
  Our ability to borrow under the revolver is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of accounts receivable, inventory and prescription files. At August 27, 2016, we had $2,350.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolver and had letters of credit outstanding against the revolver of $67.8 million, which resulted in additional borrowing capacity of $1,282.2 million. If at any time the total credit exposure outstanding under our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility and the principal amount of our other senior obligations exceeds the borrowing base, we will be required to make certain other mandatory prepayments to eliminate such shortfall. Additionally, the Merger Agreement limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness for borrowed money, including a requirement that borrowings under the revolver not exceed $3.0 billion in the aggregate immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.  
     
  The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility restricts us and all of our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, second priority secured term loan facilities, secured guaranteed notes and unsecured guaranteed notes (the  Subsidiary Guarantors ) from accumulating cash on hand in excess of $200.0 million at any time when revolving loans are outstanding (not including cash located in our store deposit accounts and cash necessary to cover our current liabilities) and from accumulating cash on hand with revolver borrowings in excess of $100.0 million over three consecutive business days. The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility also states that if at any time (other than following the exercise of remedies or acceleration of any senior obligations or second priority debt and receipt of a triggering notice by the senior collateral agent from a representative of the senior obligations or the second priority debt) either (a) an event of default exists under our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility or (b) the sum of revolver availability under our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility and certain amounts held on deposit with the senior collateral agent in a concentration account is less than $275.0 million for three consecutive business days or less than or equal to $200.0 million on any day (a  cash sweep period ), the funds in our deposit accounts will be swept to a concentration account with the senior collateral agent and will be applied first to repay outstanding revolving loans under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, and then held as collateral for the senior obligations until such cash sweep period is rescinded pursuant to the terms of our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility.  
     
  The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility allows us to have outstanding, at any time, up to $1.5 billion in secured second priority debt, split-priority term loan debt, unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock in addition to borrowings under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility and existing indebtedness, provided that not in excess of $750.0 million of such secured second priority debt, split-priority term loan debt, unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock shall mature or require scheduled payments of principal prior to 90 days after the latest of (a) the fifth anniversary of the effectiveness of the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility and (b) the latest maturity date of any Term Loan or Other Revolving Loan (each as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility) (excluding bridge facilities allowing extensions on customary terms to at least the date that is 90 days after such date and, with respect to any escrow notes issued by Rite Aid, excluding any special mandatory redemption of the type described in clause (iii) of the definition of  Escrow Notes  in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility). Subject to the limitations described in clauses (a) and (b) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility additionally allows us to issue or incur an unlimited amount of unsecured debt and disqualified preferred stock so long as a Financial Covenant Effectiveness Period (as defined in the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility) is not in effect; provided, however, that certain of our other outstanding indebtedness limits the amount of unsecured debt that can be incurred if certain interest coverage levels are not met at the time of incurrence or other exemptions are not available. The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility also contains certain restrictions on the amount of secured first priority debt we are able to incur. The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility also allows for the voluntary repurchase of any debt or other convertible debt, so long as the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility is not in default and we maintain availability under our revolving credit facility of more than $365.0 million.

Table of Contents   
     
  The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility has a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 (a) on any date on which availability under the revolving credit facility is less than $200.0 million or (b) on the third consecutive business day on which availability under the revolving credit facility is less than $250.0 million and, in each case, ending on and excluding the first day thereafter, if any, which is the 30th consecutive calendar day on which availability under the revolving credit facility is equal to or greater than $250.0 million. As of August 27, 2016, the availability was at a level that did not did not trigger this covenant. The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility also contains covenants which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt, the payments of dividends, sale of assets, mergers and acquisitions and the granting of liens.  
     
  The Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility provides for customary events of default including nonpayment, misrepresentation, breach of covenants and bankruptcy. It is also an event of default if we fail to make any required payment on debt having a principal amount in excess of $50.0 million or any event occurs that enables, or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable, the holder of such debt to accelerate the maturity or require the repayment repurchase, redemption or defeasance of such debt.  
     
  We also have two second priority secured term loan facilities. The first includes a $470.0 million Tranche 1 Term Loan. The Tranche 1 Term Loan matures on August 21, 2020 and currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 4.75% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, if we choose to make LIBOR borrowings, or at Citibank s base rate plus 3.75%. The second includes a $500.0 million Tranche 2 Term Loan. The Tranche 2 Term Loan matures on June 21, 2021 and currently bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.875% with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, if we choose to make LIBOR borrowings, or at Citibank s base rate plus 2.875%.  
     
  The second priority secured term loan facilities and the indentures that govern our secured and guaranteed unsecured notes contain restrictions on the amount of additional secured and unsecured debt that can be incurred by us. As of August 27, 2016, the amount of additional secured debt that could be incurred under the most restrictive covenant of the second priority secured term loan facilities and these indentures was approximately $1.5 billion (which amount does not include the ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions). However, we currently cannot incur any additional secured debt assuming a fully drawn revolver and the outstanding letters of credit. The ability to issue additional unsecured debt under these indentures is generally governed by an interest coverage ratio test. As of August 27, 2016, we had the ability to issue additional unsecured debt under the second lien credit facilities and other indentures.  
     
   Other   
     
  On April 2, 2015, we issued $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% Notes to finance the majority of the cash portion of our acquisition of EnvisionRx, which closed on June 24, 2015. Our obligations under the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsubordinated basis, by all of our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Tranche 1 Term Loan, the Tranche 2 Term Loan, the 9.25% senior notes due 2020 (the  9.25% Notes ) and the 6.75% senior notes due 2021 (the  6.75% Notes ) (the  Rite Aid Subsidiary Guarantors ), including EnvisionRx and certain of its domestic subsidiaries other than EIC (the  EnvisionRx Subsidiary Guarantors  and, together with the Rite Aid Subsidiary Guarantors, the  Subsidiary Guarantors ). The guarantees are unsecured. The 6.125% Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Rite Aid Corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness.  
     
  During May 2015, $64.1 million of our 8.5% convertible notes due 2015 were converted into 24.8 million shares of common stock, pursuant to their terms. The remaining $0.1 million of our 8.5% convertible notes due 2015 were repaid by us upon maturity.  
     
  On August 15, 2015, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Notes. In connection with the redemption, we recorded a loss on debt retirement, including call premium and unamortized debt issue costs of $33.2 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  
     
   Net Cash Provided by/Used in Operating, Investing and Financing Activities   
     
  Cash flow provided by operating activities was $12.9 million and $341.6 million in the twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted by increases in accounts receivable, inventory and other assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable.  Accounts receivable increased primarily due to increased receivables at our Pharmacy Services segment, based on their normal business cycle and the growth in the PBM business.  Inventory increased at our Retail Pharmacy segment, in both pharmacy and front end.   Pharmacy inventory increased due to increases in safety stock following an extended period of inventory reductions while front end inventory increased primarily due to seasonal inventory build.  Other assets and liabilities increased due to the timing of rent payments in our Retail Pharmacy segment.  These negative 
     
 42   

Table of Contents   
     
  working capital changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable, which was due to the timing of inventory purchases at our Retail Pharmacy segment and increased amounts payable to our pharmacy network relating to the growth of our Pharmacy Services segment.  
     
  Cash used in investing activities was $247.8 million and $2,088.6 million for the twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively. Cash used in investing activities primarily decreased as compared to the prior year due to expenditures of $1,779.6 million, net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition of EnvisionRx in the prior year. Cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment was lower than in the prior year due to fewer Wellness store remodels in the current year.  
     
  Cash provided by financing activities was $246.5 million and $1,783.8 million for the twenty-six week period ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities for the twenty-six weeks ended August 27, 2016 includes net borrowings from the revolver of $250.0 million. Cash provided by financing activities for the twenty-six weeks ended August 29, 2015 reflects $1.8 billion in proceeds from our 6.125% Notes, which was used to finance the cash portion of our acquisition of EnvisionRx.  
     
   Capital Expenditures   
     
  During the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015 capital expenditures were as follows:  

Future Liquidity   
     
  We are highly leveraged. Our high level of indebtedness could: (i) limit our ability to obtain additional financing; (ii) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt; (iv) render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and (v) require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt. Based upon our current levels of operations and after giving effect to limitations in the Merger Agreement, we believe that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures at least for the next twelve months. Based on our liquidity position, which we expect to remain strong throughout the year, we do not expect to be subject to the fixed charge covenant in our senior secured credit facility in the next twelve months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance, and other relevant circumstances. Subject to the limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the requirement that we obtain WBA s consent prior to engaging in certain transactions, from time to time, we may seek deleveraging transactions, including entering into transactions to exchange debt for shares of common stock, issuance of equity (including preferred stock and convertible securities), repurchase or redemption of outstanding indebtedness, or seek to refinance our outstanding debt (including our revolving credit facility) or may otherwise seek transactions to reduce interest expense and extend debt maturities. Additionally, the Merger Agreement contains a requirement that borrowings under the revolver not exceed $3.0 billion in the aggregate immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.  Any of these transactions could impact our financial results. Upon closing of the Merger, we expect that all amounts due under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, Tranche 1 Term Loan and Tranche 2 Term Loan will be paid in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, upon closing of the Merger, the indentures governing the 9.25% Notes, the 6.75% Notes and the 6.125% Notes require the Company or WBA to make a change of control offer to repurchase such notes from the noteholders at 101% plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the extent such notes remain outstanding at the closing.

   Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share and Other Non-GAAP Measures   
     
  In addition to net income determined in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures, such as  Adjusted EBITDA , in assessing our operating performance. We believe the non-GAAP metrics serve as an appropriate measure in evaluating the performance of our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding the impact of income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, LIFO adjustments, charges or credits for facility closing and impairment, inventory write-downs related to store closings, debt retirements, and other items (including stock-based compensation expense, severance for distribution center closures, gain or loss on sale of assets, and revenue deferrals related to our customer loyalty program). We reference this particular non-GAAP financial measure frequently in our decision-making because it provides supplemental information that facilitates internal comparisons to the historical periods and external comparisons to competitors. In addition, incentive compensation is primarily based on Adjusted EBITDA and we base certain of our forward-looking estimates on Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate quantification of planned business activities and enhance subsequent follow-up with comparisons of actual to planned Adjusted EBITDA.  
     
  The following is a reconciliation of our net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015:  

The following is a reconciliation of our net income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended August 27, 2016 and August 29, 2015. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income excluding the impact of amortization of EnvisionRx intangible assets, merger and acquisition-related costs, loss on debt retirements and LIFO adjustments. We calculate Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share using our above-referenced definition of Adjusted Net Income. We believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share serve as appropriate measures to be used in evaluating the performance of our business and help our investors better compare our operating performance over multiple periods. Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share is calculated using our above-referenced definition of Adjusted Net Income:  

44   

Table of Contents   
     
  In addition to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share, we occasionally refer to several other Non-GAAP measures, on a less frequent basis, in order to describe certain components of our business and how we utilize them to describe our results. These measures include but are not limited to Adjusted EBITDA Gross Margin and Gross Profit (gross margin/gross profit excluding non-Adjusted EBITDA items), Adjusted EBITDA SG A (SG A expenses excluding non-Adjusted EBITDA items), FIFO Gross Margin and FIFO Gross Profit (gross margin/gross profit before LIFO charges), and Free Cash Flow (Adjusted EBITDA less cash paid for interest, rent on closed stores, capital expenditures, acquisition costs and the change in working capital).  
     
  We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcements in order to provide transparency to our investors and enable investors to better compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share or other non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, and are not intended to represent an alternative measure of, operating results or of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.  
     
   ITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
     
  Our future earnings, cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense. We enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital needs and general corporate purposes. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of variable-rate credit facilities, fixed-rate long-term obligations and derivative transactions. We currently do not have any derivative transactions outstanding.  
     
  The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of August 27, 2016.  

Our ability to satisfy interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed.  
     
  The interest rate on our variable rate borrowings, which include our revolving credit facility, Tranche 1 Term Loan and our Tranche 2 Term Loan, are all based on LIBOR. However, the interest rate on our Tranche 1 Term Loan and Tranche 2 Term Loan have a LIBOR floor of 100 basis points. If the market rates of interest for LIBOR changed by 100 basis points as of August 27, 2016, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $28.6 million.  
     
  A change in interest rates does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be  
     
 45   

Table of Contents   
     
  affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. Increases in interest rates would also impact our ability to refinance existing maturities on favorable terms.  
     
   ITEM 4.  Controls and Procedures     
     
   (a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  
     
   (b)  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
     
  There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
