NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

 Tiger X Medical, Inc. ("Tiger X" or the "Company"), formerly known as Cardo Medical, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under and by the virtue of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, previously operated as an orthopedic medical device company specializing in designing, developing and marketing high performance reconstructive joint
devices and spinal surgical devices.  
 During 2010, the Company discontinued its orthopedic medical device operations and sold the assets from its previous business lines during 2011. Through July 1, 2016, our continuing
operations included the collection and management of our royalty income earned in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement with Arthrex, Inc. ("Arthrex").  
 On August 22, 2016, the Company, Icicle Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub ), and BioCardia, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ( BioCardia ), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into
BioCardia, with BioCardia continuing as the surviving company under the name  BioCardia, Inc.  (the  Merger ).  The Company expects the Merger to close in October
2016. 
   Basis of Presentation 
   The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from the Company's audited financial statements as of that date,
and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, has been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q
and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, such financial information includes all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial
position at such date and the operating results and cash flows for such periods. Operating results for the interim period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the entire year. 
 Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the rules of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 25, 2016.  
   Principles of Consolidation 
   The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tiger X Medical, Inc., Accelerated Innovation, Inc. ("Accelerated"), Uni-Knee LLC ("Uni") and Cervical
Xpand LLC ("Cervical"). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

                                                 4

Royalty Agreement 
   On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Arthrex (the "Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company agreed
to sell the assets of its joint arthroplasty division, referred to as the Reconstructive Division, to Arthrex. The Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement also provided for the Company to receive
royalty payments equal to 5% of net sales of the Company's products made by Arthrex on a quarterly basis for a term up to and including the 20th anniversary of the June 10, 2011 closing
date. These amounts were reflected as royalty income on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income.  
 On May 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement (the "Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement") with Arthrex, whereby Arthrex agreed to pay
the Company $5,642,302 (the "Royalty Payment") in full satisfaction of all amounts due or payable, or which could become payable under the Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement. Of the
Royalty Payment, $142,302 of the amount represented royalty income due to the Company under the Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement through the date of the Royalty Settlement and
Release Agreement, and the remaining $5,500,000 represented the settlement of future royalties.  The Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement became effective on July 1, 2016 upon the
receipt of the Royalty Payment.  
   Use of Estimates 
   Financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Among other things, management makes estimates relating to share-
based payments and deferred income tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   Revenue Recognition 
   The Company's revenue consists of royalty income from Arthrex pursuant to the Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement. Royalty income is recognized as the amount becomes
known and collectability is reasonably assured.  
   Net Income Per Share 
   Basic net income per share is computed by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed
giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares using various methods such as the treasury stock or modified treasury stock method in the determination of diluted shares outstanding at
each reporting period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options. No dilutive potential common shares are included in
the computation of any diluted per share amount because their impact was anti-dilutive. 
   Income Taxes 
   Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
likelihood of realizing the tax benefits related to a potential deferred tax asset is evaluated, and a valuation allowance is recognized to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not
that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the beginning and end of the year; the change in the sum of the
deferred tax asset, valuation allowance and deferred tax liability during the year generally is recognized as a deferred tax expense or benefit. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date.  

                                                 5

The Company evaluates the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in its financial statements and determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be
sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in its financial statements. For those tax positions where it is "not more likely than
not" that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized. Where applicable, associated interest and penalties are also recorded. The Company has not accrued for any such
uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) or December 31, 2015. 
   Concentration of Credit Risk 
   The cash and cash equivalents held in the Company's business money market and other bank accounts are with local and national banking institutions and subjected to FDIC
insurance limits of $250,000 per banking institution. As of September 30, 2016, the Company's balances in these bank accounts exceeded the insured amount by $19,187,000. 
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
   There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that the Company has yet to adopt that are expected to have a material effect on its financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows. 

  NOTE 2 - SHARE BASED PAYMENT 
  The Company has outstanding stock options issued to employees and board members which are exercisable at $0.23 per share. The options vest 20% each year over a five year
period and expire after ten years. As of September 30, 2016, there were no unvested options. There was no stock option expense recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
or 2015 in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. 

 A summary of stock option activity as of September 30, 2016, and changes during the period then ended is presented below. 

6

On August 11, 2016, the Company granted an aggregate of 450,000 shares of restricted stock to its directors and a consultant.  Pursuant to the stock award agreement, the grant of
restricted stock of the Company vests in full on August 11, 2017 (the "Vesting Date"), subject to the recipient's continued service with the Company; provided, however, to the extent the
recipient's service with the Company is terminated for any reason within thirty (30) days prior to or upon a Change in Control (as defined in the Agreement) prior to the Vesting Date, this grant
of restricted stock will immediately and automatically vest in full.  The Company recorded stock based compensation of approximately $9,000 related to this grant during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016.  Total unrecognized expense related to the restricted stock grant amounted to approximately $54,000, which will be recognized through the Vesting Date.

NOTE 3 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 
  Our authorized capital consists of 750,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our preferred stock may be designated into series pursuant to
authority granted by our Certificate of Incorporation, and on approval from our Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any preferred stock issued.  

   ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the
reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  
 As used in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation," except where the context otherwise requires, the term "we," "us," "our," the
"Company," or "Tiger X" refers to the business of Tiger X Medical, Inc.  

   The following discussion should be read together with the information contained in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1, "Financial Statements,"
in this Form 10-Q.  

  Overview  
  Tiger X Medical, Inc. ("Tiger X" or the "Company"), formerly known as Cardo Medical, Inc., previously operated as an orthopedic medical device company specializing in designing,
developing and marketing high performance reconstructive joint devices and spinal surgical devices. During 2010, the Company discontinued its orthopedic medical device operations and
sold the assets from its previous business lines during 2011. Through July 1, 2016, our continuing operations included the collection and management of our royalty income earned in
connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement with Arthrex.  
 On August 22, 2016, the Company, Icicle Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub ), and BioCardia, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ( BioCardia ), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into
BioCardia, with BioCardia continuing as the surviving company under the name  BioCardia, Inc.  (the  Merger ).  The Company expects the Merger to close in October 2016. 

                                                 7

We are headquartered in Miami, Florida. Our common stock is quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.'s, Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or the OTC Bulletin
Board, with a trading symbol of CDOM.OB.  
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Use of Estimates 
   Financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Among other things, management makes estimates relating to share-based payments, and deferred income tax assets. Given the short operating history of Tiger X, actual results could differ
from those estimates. 
   Royalty Agreement 
   On January 24, 2011, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Arthrex (the "Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company agreed
to sell the assets of its arthroplasty division, referred to as the Reconstructive Division, to Arthrex. The Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement also provided for the Company to receive royalty
payments equal to 5% of net sales of the Company's products made by Arthrex on a quarterly basis for a term up to and including the 20th anniversary of the June 10, 2011 closing date.
These amounts were reflected as royalty income on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income.  
 On May 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement (the "Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement") with Arthrex, whereby Arthrex agreed to pay
the Company $5,642,302 (the "Royalty Payment") in full satisfaction of all amounts due or payable, or which could become payable under the Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement. Of the
Royalty Payment, $142,302 of the amount represented royalty income due to the Company under the Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement through the date of the Royalty Settlement and
Release Agreement, and the remaining $5,500,000 represented the settlement of future royalties.  The Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement became effective on July 1, 2016 upon the
receipt of the Royalty Payment.  
   Revenue Recognition 
   The Company's revenue consists of royalty income from Arthrex pursuant to the Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement. Revenue is recognized as the amount becomes known and
collectability is reasonably assured.  
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
   There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have yet to adopt that are expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015.  
  The following is a comparison of the condensed consolidated results of operations for Tiger X for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Royalty income 
   Royalty income amounted to $5,500,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $121,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Revenues represented
royalties received from Arthrex in connection with the Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement. We entered into a Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement with Arthrex on May 5, 2016 and
effective on July 1, 2016, whereby we agreed to receive approximately $5,642,000 (including approximately $142,000 of royalty income recorded during the three months ended June 30,
2016) in full satisfaction of all amounts due or payable, or which become payable under the Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement. The remaining $5,500,000 was recorded as revenue upon the
closing of the agreement on July 1, 2016. Other than this amount recorded on July 1, 2016 under the terms of the Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement, we will have no further royalty
income.  
   General and Administrative Expenses 
   General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased by $341,000 as compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to increased legal
and professional expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 associated with the Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement with Arthrex, along with the Merger Agreement with
BioCardia.  

                                                 9

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015.  
  The following is a comparison of the condensed consolidated results of operations for Tiger X for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Royalty income 
   Royalty income amounted to $5,791,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $382,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenues
represented royalties received from Arthrex in connection with the Arthrex Asset Purchase Agreement. We entered into a Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement with Arthrex on May 5,
2016 and effective on July 1, 2016, whereby we agreed to receive approximately $5,642,000 in full satisfaction of all amounts due or payable, or which become payable under the Arthrex
Asset Purchase Agreement.  Other than this amount recorded on July 1, 2016 under the terms of the Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement, we will have no further royalty income.  
   General and Administrative Expenses 
   General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $363,000 as compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to increased
legal and professional expenses associated with the Royalty Settlement and Release Agreement with Arthrex, along with the Merger Agreement with BioCardia.

  Net cash provided by operating activities was $5,597,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $217,000 for the
same period in 2015. The change between the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the same period in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in royalty income in 2016.   
 We had no cash flows from investing or financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  
 We believe our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 are adequate to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.

Forward-Looking Statements  
  Some of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "should," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "plan," "believe," "predict," "potential," "project," "target,"
"forecast," "intend," "assume," "guide," "seek" and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements are
predictive in nature and may depend upon or refer to future events, activities or conditions. Although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we cannot
provide any assurances regarding future results. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward- looking statements, or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause our actual
activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. Information regarding our risk factors appears in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors,"
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on March 25, 2016.  

   ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
  Not applicable for smaller reporting companies.  

   ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our interim principal executive officer and our interim principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our interim principal executive officer and interim principal financial officer, of
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.
Based on this evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30,
2016. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30,
2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

  PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
  ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
  We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceeding against our Company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no
proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
