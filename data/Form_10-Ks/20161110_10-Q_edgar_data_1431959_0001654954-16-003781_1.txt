NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among other things,
statements regarding plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future
events or performance and underlying assumptions and other
statements, which are other than statements of historical facts.
Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report,
including without limitation, Item 2  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.  Forward-looking statements generally can be
identified by words such as  anticipates, 
 believes,   estimates, 
 expects,   intends,   plans, 
 predicts,   projects,   will
be,   will continue,   will likely
result,  and similar expressions. These forward-looking
statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that
are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our
actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to, those
discussed in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015 and in particular, the risks
discussed in our Form 10-K under the caption  Risk
Factors  in Item 1A therein, and those discussed in other
documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ). Important factors that in our view could cause
material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of
operations include, but are not limited to, risks associated with
the company's ability to obtain additional capital in the future to
fund planned expansion, the demand for oil and natural gas, general
economic factors, competition in the industry and other factors
that may cause actual results to be materially different from those
described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

1. NATURE OF BUSINESS 

Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. was incorporated in October 2007
under the laws of the State of Nevada as Pole Perfect Studios, Inc.
( PPS ). From its incorporation to November 2010, the
company was primarily engaged in business start-up
activities. 

On November 23, 2010, we entered into and closed a Share Exchange
Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) between the major
shareholders of PPS and the shareholders of Torchlight Energy, Inc.
( TEI ). As a result of the transactions effected by
the Exchange Agreement, at closing TEI became our wholly-owned
subsidiary, and the business of TEI became our sole business. TEI
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in June
2010. We are engaged in the acquisition, exploitation and/or
development of oil and natural gas properties in the United States.
In addition to TEI, we also operate our business through our
wholly-owned subsidiaries Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC, a Texas
limited liability company, and Hudspeth Oil Corporation, a Texas
corporation. 

The Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development
and production of oil and gas properties within the United States.
The Company s success will depend in large part on its
ability to obtain and develop profitable oil and gas
interests. 

2. GOING CONCERN 

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable
to a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to
meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next
fiscal year. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable
operations. We had a net loss of $6,660,942 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and had accumulated losses of $81,564,381
since our inception to September 30, 2016, and expect to incur
further losses in the development of our business. Working Capital
as of September 30, 2016 was negative $3,752,222. Negative working
capital is exacerbated by the inclusion in current liabilities of
the $3,431,233 outstanding balance of subordinated convertible
notes which have a maturity date of June 30, 2017 and are therefore
included in current liabilities as of September 30,
2016. 

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent on its ability to generate future profitable operations
and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations
and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations
when they come due. Management s plan to address the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern includes:
(1) obtaining debt or equity funding from private placement or
institutional sources; (2) obtain loans from financial
institutions, where possible; (3) participating in joint venture
transactions with third parties; or (4) sale of assets. Although
management believes that it will be able to obtain the necessary
funding to allow the Company to remain a going concern through the
methods discussed above, there can be no assurances that such
methods will prove successful. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Company maintains its accounts on the accrual method of
accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Accounting principles
followed and the methods of applying those principles, which
materially affect the determination of financial position, results
of operations and cash flows are summarized below: 

Use of estimates     The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and certain assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.  

Basis of presentation   The
financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and
include all of the accounts of Torchlight Energy Resources Inc. and
its wholly owned subsidiaries, Torchlight Energy, Inc., Torchlight
Energy Operating, LLC, and Hudspeth Oil Corporation. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.  

Risks and uncertainties    
The Company s operations are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological, and
other risks associated with operating an emerging business,
including the potential risk of business
failure.  

Concentration of risks    
The Company s cash is placed with a highly rated financial
institution, and the Company periodically reviews the credit
worthiness of the financial institutions with which it does
business. At times the Company s cash balances are in excess
of amounts guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.  

Fair value of financial instruments     Financial instruments consist of cash,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable to related
party, and convertible promissory notes. The estimated fair values
of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and related party
payables approximate the carrying amount due to the relatively
short maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the
convertible promissory notes approximate their fair value giving
affect for the term of the note and the effective interest
rates.

continued    

For
assets and liabilities that require re-measurement to fair value
the Company categorizes them in a three-level fair value hierarchy
as follows: 

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market
corroboration. 

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on
management s own assumptions used to measure assets and
liabilities at fair value. 

A financial asset or liability s classification within the
hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. 

Accounts receivable    
Accounts receivable consist of uncollateralized oil and natural gas
revenues due under normal trade terms, as well as amounts due from
working interest owners of oil and gas properties for their share
of expenses paid on their behalf by the Company. Management reviews
receivables periodically and reduces the carrying amount by a
valuation allowance that reflects management s best estimate
of the amount that may not be collectible. As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 no valuation allowance was considered
necessary.  

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a $419,839 account
receivable from Husky Ventures for the estimated balance of the
sale proceeds from the sale of the Chisholm Trail properties in
fourth quarter, 2015. The Chisholm Trail properties were sold to
Husky Ventures who then included them with the Husky interests in
Chisholm Trail and then entered into a sale agreement with Gastar
Exploration Inc. for the combined Torchlight and Husky interests.
Receipt of the balance of the sale proceeds was subject to final
determination of mineral lease classification and was to occur by
February 28, 2016. 

On June
14, 2016, after the lawsuit that is described in Part II Item 1.
 Legal Proceedings  regarding the Hunton Play, the
Company received and subsequently deposited a check from Husky
Ventures in the amount of $520,400. Husky Ventures designated that
the check was in full satisfaction of its obligations under the
transaction in which the Company sold the Chisholm Trail properties
as described above. The Company does not believe the check is in
full satisfaction of Husky Ventures s obligations, including
but not limited to that Husky Ventures has provided insufficient
information for the Company regarding this transaction. The Company
is currently pursuing claims against Husky Ventures, and others,
related to this transaction and intends to continue to pursue those
claims as described further in Part II Item 1.  Legal
Proceedings  regarding the Hunton Play. 

Investment in oil and gas properties     The Company uses the full cost method of
accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by
the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Under
this method of accounting, the costs of unsuccessful, as well as
successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized
as properties and equipment. This includes any internal costs that
are directly related to property acquisition, exploration and
development activities but does not include any costs related to
production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain
or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties
is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly
alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved
reserves.  

Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs
being depleted or amortized. Oil and natural gas property costs
excluded represent investments in unevaluated properties and
include non-producing leasehold, geological, and geophysical costs
associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration
drilling costs. The Company allocates a portion of its acquisition
costs to unevaluated properties based on relative value. Costs are
transferred to the full cost pool as the properties are evaluated
over the life of the reservoir. 

As of June 30, 2016 the Company performed an assessment of
evaluated and unevaluated costs in the cost pool to conform the
cumulative value of the Full Cost Pool to the combined amount of
Reserve Value of evaluated, producing properties (as determined by
independent analysis at December 31, 2015), plus the lesser of
cumulative historical cost or estimated realizable value of
unevaluated leases and projects expected to commence production in
future operating periods. The results of the assessment was an
additional charge to Impairment Expense of $57,912 on June 30,
2016. No further adjustments were required at September 30,
2016. 

Capitalized interest     The Company capitalizes interest on unevaluated
properties during the periods in which they are excluded from costs
being depleted or amortized. During the periods ended September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company capitalized $106,388 (net
of full cost pool adjustments) and $577,576, respectively, of
interest on unevaluated properties.  

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization     The depreciable base for oil and natural
gas properties includes the sum of all capitalized costs net of
accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization
( DD A ), estimated future development costs and
asset retirement costs not included in oil and natural gas
properties, less costs excluded from amortization. The depreciable
base of oil and natural gas properties is amortized on a
unit-of-production method.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    -
continued   

Ceiling test     Future
production volumes from oil and gas properties are a significant
factor in determining the full cost ceiling limitation of
capitalized costs. Under the full cost method of accounting, the
Company is required to periodically perform a  ceiling
test  that determines a limit on the book value of oil and
gas properties. If the net capitalized cost of proved oil and gas
properties, net of related deferred income taxes, plus the cost of
unproved oil and gas properties, exceeds the present value of
estimated future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent, net of
related tax affects, plus the cost of unproved oil and gas
properties, the excess is charged to expense and reflected as
additional accumulated DD A. The ceiling test calculation uses
a commodity price assumption which is based on the unweighted
arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month for
each month within the prior 12 month period and excludes future
cash outflows related to estimated abandonment costs. The Company
recognized impairment of $22,438,114 on its oil and gas properties
during the three months ended June 30, 2015 and an additional
impairment at December 31, 2015 of $3,236,009 for a total
impairment adjustment for 2015 of $25,674,123. Impairment in the
amount of $57,912 was recognized at June 30, 2016 as a result of
the Company s assessment. . No further adjustments were
required at September 30, 2016. Due to the volatility of commodity
prices, should oil and natural gas prices decline in the future, it
is possible that a write-down could occur. Proved reserves are
estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas
liquids, which geological and engineering data demonstrate with
reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under
existing economic and operating conditions. The independent
engineering estimates include only those amounts considered to be
proved reserves and do not include additional amounts which may
result from new discoveries in the future, or from application of
secondary and tertiary recovery processes where facilities are not
in place or for which transportation and/or marketing contracts are
not in place. Estimated reserves to be developed through secondary
or tertiary recovery processes are classified as unevaluated
properties.  

The determination of oil and gas reserves is a subjective process,
and the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of
available data and the application of engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment. Estimates of economically recoverable
reserves and future net cash flows depend on a number of variable
factors and assumptions that are difficult to predict and may vary
considerably from actual results. In particular, reserve estimates
for wells with limited or no production history are less reliable
than those based on actual production. Subsequent re-evaluation of
reserves and cost estimates related to future development of proved
oil and gas reserves could result in significant revisions to
proved reserves. Other issues, such as changes in regulatory
requirements, technological advances, and other factors which are
difficult to predict could also affect estimates of proved reserves
in the future. 

Gains and losses on the sale of oil and gas properties are not
generally reflected in income unless the gain or loss would
significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and
proved reserves. Sales of less than 100% of the Company s
interest in the oil and gas property are treated as a reduction of
the capital cost of the field, with no gain or loss recognized, as
long as doing so does not significantly affect the
unit-of-production depletion rate. Costs of retired equipment, net
of salvage value, are usually charged to accumulated
depreciation. 

Asset retirement obligations     Accounting principles require that the
fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement
obligation ( ARO ) be recorded in the period in which
it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made,
and that the corresponding cost be capitalized as part of the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is
accreted to its then-present value each subsequent period, and the
capitalized cost is depleted over the useful life of the related
asset. Abandonment cost incurred is recorded as a reduction to the
ARO liability.  

Inherent in the fair value calculation of an ARO are numerous
assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement
amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing
of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental,
and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these
assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability, a
corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property
balance. Settlements greater than or less than amounts accrued as
ARO are recorded as a gain or loss upon settlement. 

Asset retirement obligation activity is disclosed in Note
10. 

Share-based compensation     Compensation cost for equity awards is
based on the fair value of the equity instrument on the date of
grant and is recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award. Compensation
cost for liability awards is based on the fair value of the vested
award at the end of each period.  

Revenue recognition     The
Company recognizes oil and gas revenues when production is sold at
a fixed or determinable price, persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has
transferred, and collectability is reasonably
assured.  

Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share       Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed in the
same way as basic earnings (loss) per common share except that the
denominator is increased to include the number of additional common
shares that would be outstanding if all potential common shares had
been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The
Company has not included potentially dilutive securities in the
calculation of loss per share for any periods presented as the
effects would be anti-dilutive.  

Environmental laws and regulations     The Company is subject to extensive
federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations.
Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on
their future economic benefit. The Company believes that it is in
compliance with existing laws and regulations.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    -
continued   

Recent accounting pronouncements      

On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, which provides
guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern
uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard
requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity
must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise
substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a
going concern. The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for
annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
thereafter, with early adoption permitted. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 that introduces a new
five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to
enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with
customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about
contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in
judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or
fulfill a contract. This standard is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the new
guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and
Disclosures of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08 ).
ASU 2014-08 revises the definition of discontinued operations by
limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of
components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have
(or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and
financial results, removing the lack of continuing involvement
criteria and requiring discontinued operations reporting for the
disposal of an equity method investment that meets the definition
of discontinued operations. The update also requires expanded
disclosures for discontinued operations, including disclosure of
pretax profit or loss of an individually significant component of
an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations
reporting. The update is effective prospectively to all periods
beginning after December 15, 2014. Currently, the Company does not
expect the adoption of ASU 2014-08 to have a material impact on our
financial statements or results of operations. 

Other recently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements are not
expected to have, or did not have, a material impact on the
Company s financial position or results from
operations. 

Subsequent events     The
Company evaluated subsequent events through November 10, 2016, the
date of issuance of the financial statements. Subsequent events are
disclosed in Note 11.  

4. RELATED PARTY PAYABLES 

As of September 30, 2016, related party payables consisted of
accrued and unpaid compensation of $45,000 to one of our executive
officers and a Director Fee payable to one of our Directors, Mr.
Edward J. Devereaux of $36,112. Mr. Devereaux elected to receive
$50,000 of the Director Fee in cash when funds are available. As of
September 30, 2016 $13,888 had been paid to Mr.
Devereaux. 

On November 4, 2014, Eunis L. Shockey, a member of the Board of
directors, loaned us $500,000 under a 30 day promissory note. The
promissory note accrues interest at an annual rate of 10%. The
balance of the note at September 30, 2016 was $134,375. The due
date of the note is December 31, 2016. 

5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

The Company is subject to contingencies as a result of
environmental laws and regulations. Present and future
environmental laws and regulations applicable to the
Company s operations could require substantial capital
expenditures or could adversely affect its operations in other ways
that cannot be predicted at this time. As of September 30, 2016, no
amounts had been recorded because no specific liability has been
identified that is reasonably probable of requiring the Company to
fund any future material amounts. 

6. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued
150,000 shares of common stock as compensation for consulting

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued 10,000
shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series C
Preferred ) to certain investors at a purchase price of $100
per share for total consideration of $1,000,000 cash. We filed the
Certificate of Designation for the Series C Preferred with the
Secretary of State of Nevada on July 8, 2016. The designations,
preferences, limitations, restrictions and relative rights of the
Series C Preferred are as follows: (i) a stated valueof $100 per
share; (ii) mandatory conversion on the earlier of 92 days after
the spud date of Hazel Prospect or October 13, 2016, with each
holder having the right to convert at its election any time before
that; (iii) a conversion price of $1.01 per share of common stock;
(iv) each holder has the right to convert its shares into a
proportionate heads up working interest in the Hazel Prospect,
provided such election is made prior to the mandatory stock
conversion date described in  (ii)  above, which
working interest will be determined by dividing the number of
shares the holder is converting by 10,000 and multiplying the
result by one-third; (v) no rights to dividends; (vi) no voting
rights; and (vii) in the event of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders will be
entitled to be paid out of the assets available for distribution to
our stockholders, before any payment is to be made to the holders
of common stock, but after the payment to the holders of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock.  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
issued 1,822,656 shares of common stock in conversion of preferred
stock (Series  B ) valued at $3,699,991. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
issued 2,069,065 shares of common stock in exercise of warrants at
$.50 per share in connection with an offering to warrant holders
dated June 16, 2016 to exercise warrants at the reduced exercise
price of $.50 per share regardless of the original exercise price
of warrants they were holding. The offering was scheduled to close
on June 30, 2016, however the Company elected to extend the
expiration of the offering to July 15, 2016. Any warrants not
exercised within the offering period retained their original terms
including the original exercise price. The exercise price
adjustment was considered as a debt agreement modification for
accounting purposes. The adjustment arising from the comparison of
the fair value of the warrants at their original grant date to the
fair value recalculated at the modification date (the re pricing
date) was $52,270 for the three months ended September 30,
2016. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
issued 250,000 shares of common stock in exercise of warrants at
$.50 per share in connection with the termination of a consulting
agreement. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
issued 425,000 warrants in connection with oil and gas lease
related costs of $221,000. 

A summary of stock options and warrants outstanding as of September
30, 2016 by exercise price and year of expiration is presented

continued   

At September 30, 2016 the Company had reserved 22,160,081 shares
for future exercise of warrants and stock options. 

Warrants issued in relation to the promissory notes issued (see
note 9) were valued using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model.
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the warrants
issued are as follows: 

7. CAPITALIZED COSTS 

The following table presents the capitalized costs of the Company
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Unevaluated costs as of September 30, 2016 include cumulative costs
on developing projects including the Orogrande and Hazel Projects
in West Texas and adjusted costs of nonproducing leases in
Oklahoma. 

8. INCOME TAXES 

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry
forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established
to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that
the related tax benefits will not be realized. The Company has
placed a 100% valuation allowance against the net deferred tax
asset because future realization of these assets is not
assured. 

Authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes requires
that the Company recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax
position only after determining that the relevant tax authority
would more likely than not sustain the position following an
examination. Management has reviewed the Company s tax
positions and determined there were no uncertain tax positions
requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements. The
Company s tax returns remain subject to Federal and State tax
examinations for the years 2012 through 2015. Generally, the
applicable statutes of limitation are three to four years from
their respective filings. 

Estimated interest and penalties related to potential underpayment
on any unrecognized tax benefits are classified as a component of
tax expense in the statement of operation. The Company has not
recorded any interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax
benefits for any periods covered by these financial
statements. 

The Company had a net deferred tax asset related to federal net
operating loss carry forwards at September 30, 2016 of $36,802,748
available to offset future taxable income. The federal net
operating loss carry forward will begin to expire in 2030.
Realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent, in part, on
generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the
loss carry forwards. The Company has placed a 100% valuation
allowance against the net deferred tax asset because future
realization of these assets is not assured.

11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Divestiture of Assets 

Effective
October 1, 2016, the Company sold all its interest in the Marcelina
Project in Wilson County, Texas including 1,060 leased acres and
three producing wells. The sale price was $550,000 of which
$207,000 was received in cash and responsibility for payment of
$343,000 in vendor accounts payable related to the properties was
transferred to the purchaser. Additionally, the Company issued
50,000 shares of common stock to Bayshore Operating Corporation,
LLC, the operator of the properties, in connection with the sale. A
loss on the sale of approximately $64,000 will be recognized in the
fourth quarter, 2016. 

Series C Preferred Conversion 

On July
8, 2016, we sold a total of 10,000 shares of Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock (the  Series C Preferred ) to certain
investors at a purchase price of $100 per share for total
consideration of $1,000,000. See Note 6,  Stockholder s
Equity,  above. 

As of September 30, 2016, Torchlight owned a 66.66% working
interest in approximately 12,000 acres in the Hazel Prospect AMI in
the Midland Basin having acquired it from McCabe Petroleum
Corporation in exchange for 1,500,000 warrants to purchase our
common stock. On October 10, 2016, a ll of the holders of the
Series C Preferred converted into an aggregate 33% working interest
in the Hazel Prospect AMI including the Flying  B 
Ranch #1 well under the terms of the Certificate of Designation.
The Series C Preferred holders, in the case of electing to convert
the Series C Preferred into a working interest in the Flying
 B  Ranch well, were also entitled to a capital credit
(with the operator of the property) toward development expenses
equal to their invested amount into the Series C Preferred. The
Company had transferred the entire $1,000,000 in proceeds from the
issuance of the Series C Preferred to the operator as a prepayment
of development costs. Since the Series C Preferred holders elected
to convert into the Flying  B  working interest, they
also received capital credit on the records of the operator for the
balance of any part of the prepayment placed by the Company not
applied to the development cost of the Flying  B  well.
The conversion by the Series C Preferred holders and related
capital credit transfer results in the Company incurring a
liability during fourth quarter, 2016 of $339,624 for its share of
development cost related to its remaining 33.34% working interest
in the well. 

Letter of Intent for Additional Hazel Project Acreage 

On
November 10, 2016, Torchlight entered into a nonbinding letter of
intent ( LOI ) with Torchlight s Chairman, Greg
McCabe, to purchase an entity he owns which holds an additional
40.66% Working Interest in the Hazel Prospect. Upon entering into
and closing a definitive agreement, Torchlight s total
ownership would increase to 74% Working Interest. Under the
proposed terms of the transaction, Torchlight would pay Mr. McCabe
3,301,379 shares of Torchlight common stock and concurrently
therewith Mr. McCabe would cancel or cause to be cancelled
3,301,379 outstanding warrants. Additionally, closing of the
transaction would be subject to Torchlight paying certain related
costs. 

Resignation of Officer 

Effective
October 5, 2016, Willard G. McAndrew III resigned his position as
Chief Operating Officer. Pursuant to the Resignation and Settlement
Agreement, Mr. McAndrew was entitled to cash compensation under his
Employment Agreement of $789,454 all of which was applied to the
exercise price of a portion of Stock Options owned by him and
resulting in the issuance of 502,837 shares of common stock. Mr.
McAndrew also surrendered 750,000 unvested Stock Options and
250,000 vested Stock Options to the Company. The remaining Stock
Options held by Mr. McAndrew totaling 2,000,000 (before exercise of
the 502,837 above) were all vested in full and reset to expire on
June 11, 2019.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

We are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation,
and/or development of oil and natural gas properties in the United
States. We operate our business through our subsidiaries Torchlight
Energy Inc., Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC, and Hudspeth Oil
Corporation. 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2016 the Board of Directors
initiated a review of Company operations in view of the divestiture
of its Oklahoma properties, beginning with the sale of the Chisholm
Trail properties in fourth quarter, 2015 and the sale of the
Cimarron properties in second quarter, 2016. During this same time
development had continued on the Orogrande Project in West Texas
and in April, 2016, the Company acquired the Hazel Project in the
Midland Basin also in West Texas. These West Texas properties
demonstrate significant potential and future production
capabilities based upon the analysis of scientific data being
gathered in the day by day development activity. Therefore, the
Board has determined to focus its efforts and capital on these two
projects to maximize shareholder value for the long
run. 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, in accordance with this new
emphasis, remaining projects in other locations were offered for
sale. The result has been the closing on August 10, 2016 of the
assignment of the Company s Ring Properties in Kansas to our
joint venture partner. Further, the Marcelina properties in South
Texas have been sold effective October 1, 2016. The Company s
remaining assets in Oklahoma consisting of three AMI s (the
Viking, Rosedale, and the Thunderbird) and four wells (two are
producing) are held pending the outcome of the lawsuit filed by
Torchlight against the operator, Husky Ventures, in May,
2016. 

The strategy in divesting of projects other than the Orogrande and
the Hazel Projects is to refocus on the greatest potential future
value for the Company while systematically eliminating debt as
noncore assets are sold and operations are
streamlined. 

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
financial statements included herewith and our audited financial
statements included with our Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the
results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future,
or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be
indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such
discussion represents only the best present assessment by our
management. 

Current Projects 

As of September 30, 2016 the Company had interests in four oil and
gas projects: the Marcelina Creek Field Development in Wilson
County, Texas, (sold effective October 1, 2016) Hunton wells
operated by Husky Ventures in Central Oklahoma, the Orogrande
Project in Hudspeth County, Texas, and the Hazel Project in the
Midland Basin in West Texas. 

Hunton Play, Central Oklahoma 

As of September 30, 2016, we were actively producing from one well
in Viking, and one in Prairie Grove. 

Legal Proceeding 

As previously disclosed, in May, 2016, Torchlight Energy Resources,
Inc. and its subsidiary Torchlight Energy, Inc. filed a lawsuit in
the 429th judicial district court in Collin County, Texas against
Husky Ventures, Inc., Charles V. Long, April Glidewell, Silverstar
of Nevada, Inc., Maximus Exploration, LLC, Atwood Acquisitions,
LLC, Gastar Exploration Inc., J. Russell Porter, Michael A.
Gerlich, Jerry R. Schuyler, and John M. Selser, Sr. 

Since the filing, the claims against the defendants April
Glidewell, Maximus Exploration, LLC, Atwood Acquisitions, LLC
and John M. Selser, Sr. have been non-suited
without prejudice to re-filing the claims.   The claims
remain pending against the remaining defendants. 

Reference Part II. Item 1. Legal Proceedings regarding the Hunton
Play for further detail. 

Viking AMI 

In the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into an Area of Mutual
Interest (AMI) with Husky Ventures, the Viking Prospect. We
acquired a 25% interest in 3,945 acres in the Viking AMI. We
subsequently acquired an additional 5% in May, 2014. We had an
interest in 8,800 total acres as of September 30, 2016. (Net
undeveloped acres = 2,600) Husky drilled the first two wells in the
AMI in second quarter, 2014. One well is currently producing
nominal quantities of oil. Our net cumulative investment through
September 30, 2016 in undeveloped acres in the Viking AMI was
$1,387,928.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    -
continued    

Rosedale AMI 

In January of 2014 we contracted for a 25% Working Interest in
approximately 5,000 acres in the Rosedale AMI in South Central
Oklahoma. We acquired an additional 5% in May, 2014. The Company
had an interest in 11,600 total acres as of September 30, 2016 (Net
undeveloped acres = 3,500). Our cumulative investment through
September 30, 2016 in the Rosedale AMI was $2,834,514. 

Prairie Grove   Judy Well 

In February of 2014, we acquired a 10% Working Interest in a well
in the Prairie Grove AMI from a non-consenting third party who
elected not to participate in the well. The well is producing
approximately 12 BOE per day. 

Thunderbird AMI 

In July of 2014, we contracted for a 25% Working Interest in the
Thunderbird AMI. The total acres in which the Company had an
interest at September 30, 2016 totals 4,300 acres (Net undeveloped
acres = 1,100). Our cumulative investment through September 30,
2016 in the Thunderbird AMI was $949,530. 

Orogrande Project, West Texas 

On August 7, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with
Hudspeth Oil Corporation ( Hudspeth ), McCabe Petroleum
Corporation ( MPC ), and Greg McCabe. Mr. McCabe was
the sole owner of both Hudspeth and MPC. Under the terms and
conditions of the Purchase Agreement, at closing, we purchased 100%
of the capital stock of Hudspeth which holds certain oil and gas
assets, including a 100% working interest in 172,000 mostly
contiguous acres in the Orogrande Basin in West Texas. This acreage
is in the primary term under five-year leases that carry additional
five-year extension provisions. As consideration, at closing we
issued 868,750 shares of our common stock to Mr. McCabe and paid a
total of $100,000 in geologic origination fees to third parties.
Additionally, Mr. McCabe will have an optional 10% working interest
back-in after payout and a reversionary interest if drilling
obligations are not met, all under the terms and conditions of a
participation and development agreement. Closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement occurred on
September 23, 2014. 

The Company finalized an agreement to sell a 5% working interest in
the Orogrande acreage on June 30, 2015 with an effective date of
April 1, 2015. Sale proceeds were $500,000 which were received in
April, 2015. In addition, the Company issued 250,000 three year
warrants with an exercise price of $.50 to the
purchaser. 

On September 23, 2015, our subsidiary, Hudspeth Oil Corporation
( HOC ), entered into a Farmout Agreement by and
between HOC, Pandora Energy, LP ( Pandora ), Founders
Oil   Gas, LLC ( Founders ), McCabe Petroleum
Corporation and Greg McCabe (McCabe Petroleum Corporation and Greg
McCabe are parties to the Farmout Agreement for limited purposes)
for the entire Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas. The
Farmout Agreement provides for Founders to earn from HOC and
Pandora (collectively, the  Farmor ) an undivided 50%
of the leasehold interest in the Orogrande Project by
Founder s spending a minimum of $45 million on actual
drilling operations on the Orogrande Project in the next two years.
Founders is to pay Farmor a total cost reimbursement of $5,000,000
in multiple installments as follows: (1) $1,000,000 at the signing
of the Farmout Agreement, the balance of which was received on
September 24, 2015; (2) within 90 days from the closing, Founders
will frac and complete the Rich A-11 No. 1 Well; and (3) within
five days of the spudding of each of the next eight wells drilled
by Founders, Founders will pay to Farmor $500,000 resulting in the
payment of the remaining amount; provided that, in the event that
within 90 days after the fracing of the Rich Well, Founders
notifies Farmor of its election not to drill any additional wells,
Founders shall have no further obligation to make further payment.
Upon payment of the first $1,000,000, Farmor assigned to Founders
an undivided 50% of the leasehold interest and a 37.5% net revenue
interest in the leases subject to the terms of the Farmout
Agreement (including obligations to re-assign to HOC and Pandora if
the 50% interest in the entire Orogrande Project is not earned) and
a proportionate share of the McCabe 10% BIAPO (back in after pay
out) interest; provided, however, that for each well that Founders
drills prior to earning the acreage, it will be assigned a 50%
working interest in the wellbore and in the lease on which it
sits. 

Under a joint operating agreement (on A.A.P.L. Form 610  
1989 Model Form Operating Agreement with COPAS 2005 Accounting
Procedures) ( JOA ) also entered into on September 23,
2015, Founders Oil   Gas Operating, LLC is designated as
operator of the leases. Any variance to the operating plan will be
determined by a Development Committee, which committee will be made
up of members from Founders and Farmor, or their designees, to
discuss and recommend the location of the drill wells, data to be
gathered and the form of same. As contemplated under the Farmout
Agreement, starting within 90 days of the completion of the fracing
on the Rich Well, and at all times subject to the 90 day continuous
drilling clause, Founders has the option, but not the obligation,
to retain the assigned interest as follows: (1) if Founders spends
a minimum of $45 million on actual drilling operations while
maintaining compliance with the continuous drilling clause, subject
to reasonable delays resulting from reasonable Force Majeure
conditions, Founders will have fulfilled its farmout obligations
and will be entitled to retain the assigned interests. If Founders
does not meet such obligations, it will reassign to Farmor the
assigned interest except it will be entitled to retain its interest
in the leases covering all wells drilled by Founders and the
sections in which such wells are located. Additionally, Founders
will resign as operator of the JOA as to all lands reassigned; and
(2) Farmor will be carried in all drilling operations during the
first two years and/or $45 million in drilling operations,
whichever comes last, subject to Founders  right to recoup
certain expenses on  Gap Wells.  After three years and
after Founders has earned its working interest, either party may
elect to market the acreage as an entire block, including
operatorship. Should an acceptable bid arise, and both parties
agree, the block will be sold 100% working interest to that third
party bidder. However, if only one party wants to accept the
outside offer, the other party (the party who wishes not to sell)
has the right to purchase the working interest from the selling
party.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         

Torchlight Energy and Founders have elected to move forward on
planning the next phase of drilling in the Orogrande Project. The
project operator planned to permit three new wells starting with
the University Founders B-19 #1 well. The new wells would be
drilled vertically for test purposes and would have sufficient
casing size to support lateral entry into any pay zone(s)
encountered once the well is tested vertically. Torchlight and the
project operator would then run a battery of tests on each well to
gain information for future development of the field. The B-19 #1
well had been drilled and tested and pipe set at June 30, 2016.
During the third quarter, 2016 development continued on the B-19
and the well was in testing phase as of September 30,
2016. 

Hazel Project in the Midland Basin in West Texas 

Effective April 1, 2016, Torchlight Energy Inc. acquired from
McCabe Petroleum Corporation a 66.66% working interest in
approximately 12,000 acres in the Midland Basin in exchange for
1,500,000 warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise
price of $1.00 for five years and a back-in after payout of a 25%
working interest to the seller. 

Initial development of the first well on the Property, the Flying
 B  Ranch #1, began July 10, 2016 and development
continued through September 30, 2016. The well was in testing phase
as of September 30, 2016. 

Historical Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015: 

Revenues and Cost of Revenues 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had production
revenue of $337,798 compared to $1,442,857 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Refer to the table of production and
revenue included below for quarterly changes in revenue. Our cost
of revenue, consisting of lease operating expenses and production
taxes, was $295,208, and $669,626 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS    -

We recorded depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense of
$740,059 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
$902,153 for the nine months ended June 30, 2015. 

The decline in revenue, cost of revenue and depreciation,
depletion, and amortization expense is attributable to the
divestiture of oil and gas producing properties beginning in the
fourth quarter, 2015 and continuing through September 30,
2016. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $5,534,933 and $12,255,704,
respectively, a decrease of $6,720,771. Our general and
administrative expenses consisted of consulting and compensation
expense, substantially all of which was non-cash or deferred,
accounting and administrative costs, professional consulting fees,
and other general corporate expenses. The change in general and
administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to 2015 is detailed as follows: 

Substantially all of the decrease is related to reduced reliance on
outside consultants who were compensated principally with stock and
warrants. 

Historical Results for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015: 

Revenues and Cost of Revenues 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had production
revenue of $34,284 compared to $400,030 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Refer to the table of production and revenue
history above. Our cost of revenue, consisting of lease operating
expenses and production taxes, was $49,908, and $159,082 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $787,228 and $3,359,679,
respectively, a decrease of $2,572,451. Our general and
administrative expenses consisted of consulting and compensation
expense, substantially all of which was non-cash or deferred,
accounting and administrative costs, professional consulting fees,
and other general corporate expenses. The change in general and
administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30,
2016 compared to 2015 is detailed as follows:

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS    -
continued        

Substantially all of the decrease is related to reduced reliance on
outside consultants who were compensated principally with stock and
warrants. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2016, we had working capital of ($3,752,222),
current assets of $1,879,301 consisting of cash, accounts
receivable, notes receivable, and prepaid expenses and total assets
of $11,483,380 consisting of current assets, investments in oil and
gas properties, and other assets. As of September 30, 2016, we had
current liabilities of $5,631,523, consisting of, accounts payable
(principally for development costs), payables to related parties,
notes payable, and accrued interest. Negative working capital is
exacerbated by the inclusion in current liabilities of the
$3,431,233 outstanding balance of subordinated convertible notes
which have a maturity date of June 30, 2017 and are therefore
included in current liabilities as of September 30, 2016.
Stockholders  equity was $5,850,146. 

Cash flow provided by (used) in operating activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $(2,902,894) compared to
$(1,505,816) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an
increase of $397,078. Cash flow provided (used) by operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 can be
primarily attributed to net losses from operations of $6,660,942
which consists primarily of $5,534,933 in general and
administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization
of $740,059, and accretion of convertible note discounts of
$142,867. Cash flow provided (used) by operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 can be primarily attributed to
net losses from operations of $36,456,359, which consists primarily
of $12,255,704 in general and administrative expenses,
depreciation, depletion, and amortization of $902,153, accretion of
convertible note discounts of $1,228,161, and impairment expense of
$22,438,114. We expect to continue to use cash flow in operating
activities until such time as we achieve sufficient commercial oil
and gas production to cover all of our cash costs. 

Cash flow used in investing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $27,780 compared to $2,418,460 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Cash flow used in investing
activities consists primarily of oil and gas investments in Texas
properties during the nine months ended September 30,
2016. 

Cash flow provided by financing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was $2,066,984 as compared to $5,636,096
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash flow provided by
financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from common
stock issues, promissory notes, and warrant exercises. We expect to
continue to have cash flow provided by financing activities as we
seek new rounds of financing and continue to develop our oil and
gas investments. 

Our current assets are insufficient to meet our current obligations
or to satisfy our cash needs over the next twelve months and as
such we will require additional debt or equity financing to meet
our plans and needs. We face obstacles in continuing to attract new
financing due to industry conditions and our history and current
record of net losses and working capital deficits. Despite our
efforts, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain
the financing required to meet our stated objectives or even to
continue as a going concern. 

We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the
foreseeable future.

OPERATIONS    -

Commitments and Contingencies 

We are subject to contingencies as a result of environmental laws
and regulations. Present and future environmental laws and
regulations applicable to our operations could require substantial
capital expenditures or could adversely affect our operations in
other ways that cannot be predicted at this time. As of September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, no amounts have been recorded
because no specific liability has been identified that is
reasonably probable of requiring us to fund any future material
amounts. 

As of September 30, 2016 the Company had interests in four oil and
gas projects: the Marcelina Creek Field Development in Wilson
County, Texas, the Hunton play in Central Oklahoma, the Orogrande
Project in Hudspeth County, Texas, and the Hazel Project in the
Midland Basin in West Texas. See the description under
 Current Projects  above under  Overview 
for more information and disclosure regarding commitments and
contingencies relating to these projects.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30,
2016. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to ensure that the information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports we submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the applicable rules and forms and that such
information was accumulated and communicated to our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, in a manner that
allowed for timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have indicated that, upon evaluation, there were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting or other factors during
the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and its subsidiary Torchlight
Energy, Inc. has pending in the 429th judicial district court in
Collin County, Texas a lawsuit against Husky Ventures, Inc.,
Charles V. Long, Silverstar of Nevada, Inc., Gastar Exploration
Inc., J. Russell Porter, Michael A. Gerlich, and Jerry R. Schuyler
that was originally filed in May 2016 (previous defendants April
Glidewell, Maximus Exploration, LLC, Atwood Acquisitions, LLC and
John M. Selser, Sr have been non-suited without prejudice to
re-filing the claims). In the lawsuit, we allege, among other
things, that the defendants acted improperly in connection with
multiple transactions, and that the defendants misrepresented and
omitted material information to us with respect to these
transactions. The lawsuit seeks damages arising from 15 different
causes of action, including without limitation, violations of the
Texas Securities Act, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of
fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and tortious
interference. The lawsuit also seeks a complete accounting as to
how our investment funds were used, including all transfers between
and among the defendants. We are seeking the full amount of our
damages on $20,000,000 invested. At this time we believe our
damages to be in excess of $1,000,000, but the precise amount will
be determined in the litigation.

against McAndrew pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) an act or

5.      Older Workers  Benefit
Protection Act; Advice of Counsel; Revocation Period.  THIS
AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY WAIVES ALL OF MCANDREW S RIGHTS AND
CLAIMS ARISING UNDER THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF

WORKERS  BENEFIT PROTECTION ACT, AS AMENDED. In connection
with this waiver, McAndrew understands and agrees
that: 

(a) 

  McAndrew is,

carefully read and fully understands all of the provisions and
effects of this Agreement and McAndrew knowingly and voluntarily

  McAndrew relied
solely and completely upon McAndrew s own judgment or the
advice of an attorney in entering into this Agreement. 

(f) 

  McAndrew has been
given at least 21 days to consider the terms of this Agreement
before signing it.

Termination
and Settlement Agreement 

(g) 

  If McAndrew signs
this Agreement prior to the end of the 21-day time period, McAndrew
certifies that, in accordance with 29 CFR  1625.22(e)(6),
McAndrew knowingly and voluntarily decided to sign the Agreement
after considering it for less than 21 days and the decision to do
so was not induced by the Company or Company Related Entities or
Persons through fraud, misrepresentation, or a threat to withdraw
or alter the offer prior to the expiration of the 21-day time
period. McAndrew has not been asked by the Company or Company
Related Entities or Persons to shorten the time-period for
consideration of whether to sign this Agreement. If McAndrew
decides to sign this Agreement prior to the end of the 21-day time
period, the Company and Company Related Entities or Persons will
not provide different terms to McAndrew as a result of this
decision. If McAndrew waives some portion of the 21-day time
period, the Company and Company Related Entities or Persons may
expedite the processing of benefits provided to   McAndrew   in exchange for signing this
Agreement. 

(h) 

  McAndrew may change
McAndrew s mind and revoke this Agreement at any time within
