CERNER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

(1) Interim Statement Presentation 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Cerner Corporation (Cerner, the Company, we, us or our) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our latest annual report on Form 10-K. 
    
  In management s opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Our interim results as presented in this Form 10-Q are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the entire year. 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared using GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Fiscal Period End 
    
  Our third fiscal quarter ends on the Saturday closest to September 30.  The 2016 and 2015 third quarters ended on October 1, 2016 and October 3, 2015, respectively. All references to years in these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements represent the respective three or nine months ended on such dates, unless otherwise noted  . 
    
  Siemens Health Services 
    
  On   February 2, 2015  , we acquired Siemens Health Services, as further described in Note (2). The addition of the Siemens Health Services business impacts the comparability of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , in relation to the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015  , presented herein. 
    
  Voluntary Separation Plan 
    
  In the first quarter of 2015, the Company adopted a voluntary separation plan ("VSP") for eligible associates. Generally, the VSP was available to U.S. associates who met a minimum level of combined age and tenure, excluding, among others, our executive officers.   Associates who elected to participate in the VSP received financial benefits commensurate with their tenure and position, along with vacation payout and medical benefits.   During the   nine months ended     October 3, 2015  , we recorded pre-tax charges for the VSP of   $45 million  , which is included in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of January 2, 2016, this program was complete. 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company adopted a new voluntary separation plan ("2016 VSP") for eligible associates. This 2016 VSP is available to U.S. associates who meet a minimum level of combined age and tenure.   Associates who elect to participate in the 2016 VSP will receive financial benefits commensurate with their tenure and position, along with vacation payout and medical benefits  . The irrevocable acceptance period for most associates electing to participate in the 2016 VSP ends in December 2016. Based on the number of eligible associates, and our estimate of participation, we expect the corresponding pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 to approximate   $35 million  . 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  Revenue Recognition.     In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The new standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  We expect to use the cumulative effect transition method, and we do not expect to early adopt.  We  
  
   5 

     Table of Contents  

are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09, and its subsequent amendments discussed below, will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  .  ASU 2016-08 amends the principal versus agent guidance in ASU 2014-09, and clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods or services before they are transferred to the customer.    
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  .  ASU 2016-10 amends the revenue guidance in ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.    
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . ASU 2016-12 amends the revenue guidance in ASU 2014-09 regarding (1) assessing collectability, (2) presentation of sales taxes, (3) non-cash consideration, and (4) completed contracts and contract modifications at transition.    
    
  Consolidation.     In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which provides guidance when evaluating whether to consolidate certain legal entities. The updated guidance modifies evaluation criteria of limited partnerships and similar legal entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  Financial Instruments.      In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10)  :   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and we have not determined if we will early adopt.    
    
  Leases.      In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which introduces a new model that requires most leases to be reported on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in the new revenue recognition standard. The standard requires the use of the modified retrospective transition approach. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and we have not determined if we will early adopt.    
    
  Share-Based Compensation.      In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  ASU 2016-09 changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) accounting and cash flow classification for excess tax benefits and deficiencies, (2) forfeitures, and (3) tax withholding requirements and cash flow classification.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and we do not expect to early adopt. 
    
  Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.     In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which provides new guidance regarding the measurement and recognition of credit impairment for certain financial assets. Such guidance will impact how we determine our allowance for estimated uncollectible receivables and evaluate our available-for-sale investments for impairment. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2019.  We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and we have not determined if we will early adopt. 
    
  Cash Flow Presentation.     In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which includes clarifying guidance regarding the cash flow statement presentation of contingent consideration payments made after business combinations. The standard requires use of the retrospective transition method, however entities may apply the guidance prospectively if retrospective application would be  
  
   6 

     Table of Contents  

impracticable. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted. At this time, we have not selected a transition method, nor have we determined if we will early adopt. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.     
    
  Income Taxes.     In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory  , which provides new guidance regarding when an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of certain intra-entity asset transfers. The standard requires the use of the modified retrospective transition approach. ASU 2016-16 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-16 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and we have not determined if we will early adopt.

(2)     Business Acquisitions 
    
  On   February 2, 2015  , we acquired substantially all of the assets, and assumed certain liabilities of   Siemens Health Services   (now referred to as "Cerner Health Services"), the health information technology business unit of Siemens AG, a stock corporation established under the laws of Germany, and its affiliates.  In the first quarter of 2016, we finalized our allocation of purchase price as appraisals of tangible and intangible assets were completed: 

The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   were as follows: 

The following table provides unaudited pro forma results of operations for the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015   as if acquisition of the Cerner Health Services business had been completed on the first day of our 2015 fiscal year. 

These pro forma results are based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the period presented, nor are they indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods.   The pro forma results for the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015   include pre-tax adjustments for amortization of intangible assets, fair value adjustments for deferred revenue, and the elimination of acquisition costs of   $7 million  ,   $6 million   and   $20 million  , respectively. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015  , we incurred   $20 million   of pre-tax costs in connection with our acquisition of the Cerner Health Services business, which are included in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

(3) Fair Value Measurements 
    
  We determine fair value measurements used in our consolidated financial statements based upon the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1   Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access. 
                
    Level 2   Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 3   Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
       
  The following table details our financial assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at   October 1, 2016  :

We estimate the fair value of our long-term, fixed rate debt using a Level 3 discounted cash flow analysis based on current borrowing rates for debt with similar maturities. We estimate the fair value of our long-term, variable rate debt using a Level 3 discounted cash flow analysis based on LIBOR rate forward curves. The fair value of our long-term debt, including current maturities, at   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016   was approximately   $531 million   and   $505 million  , respectively. The carrying amount of such debt at both   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016   was   $500 million  .

(5) Receivables 
    
  A summary of net receivables is as follows: 

During the second quarter of 2008, Fujitsu Services Limited s (Fujitsu) contract as the prime contractor in the National Health Service (NHS) initiative to automate clinical processes and digitize medical records in the Southern region of England was terminated by the NHS.  This had the effect of automatically terminating our subcontract for the project. We continue to be in dispute with Fujitsu regarding Fujitsu s obligation to pay the amounts comprised of accounts receivable and contracts receivable related to that subcontract, and we are working with Fujitsu to resolve these issues based on processes provided for in the contract.  Part of that process requires final resolution of disputes between Fujitsu and the NHS regarding the contract termination.  As of   October 1, 2016  , it remains unlikely that our matter with Fujitsu will be resolved in the next 12 months.  Therefore, these receivables have been classified as long-term and represent less than the majority of other long-term assets at   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  .  While the ultimate collectability of the receivables pursuant to this process is uncertain, we believe that we have valid and equitable grounds for recovery of such amounts and that collection of recorded amounts is probable.  Nevertheless, it is reasonably possible that our estimates regarding collectability of such amounts might materially change in the near term, considering that we do not have complete knowledge of the status of the proceedings between Fujitsu and NHS and their effect on our claim. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , we received total client cash collections of   $3.8 billion   and   $3.2 billion  , respectively. 

(6) Income Taxes 
    
  We determine the tax provision for interim periods using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment. 
    
  Our effective tax rate was   30.7%   and   32.6%   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate is primarily the result of the permanent reinstatement of the U.S. research and development tax credit in December 2015.

(7) Earnings Per Share 
    
  A reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations are as follows: 

For the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , options to purchase   8.1 million   and   3.9 million   shares of common stock at per share prices ranging from   $47.84   to   $73.40   and   $48.39   to   $73.40  , respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. 

For the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , options to purchase   7.2 million   and   2.5 million   shares of common stock at per share prices ranging from   $47.38   to   $73.40   and   $51.97   to   $73.40  , respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.

Treasury Stock 
    
  In March 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program that allows the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock up to   $300 million  , excluding transaction costs. The repurchases are to be effectuated in the open market, by block purchase, or possibly through other transactions managed by broker-dealers. No time limit was set for completion of the program. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , we repurchased   3.7 million   shares for consideration of   $200 million  . These shares were recorded as treasury stock and accounted for under the cost method. No repurchased shares have been retired.  At   October 1, 2016  ,   $100 million   remains available for repurchase under the program. 

(9) Contingencies 
    
  We accrue estimates for resolution of any legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and estimable, in accordance with ASC 450,   Contingencies  . 
    
  The terms of our software license agreements with our clients generally provide for a limited indemnification of such clients against losses, expenses and liabilities arising from third party claims based on alleged infringement by our solutions of an intellectual property right of such third party. The terms of such indemnification often limit the scope of and remedies for such indemnification obligations and generally include a right to replace or modify an infringing solution. To date, we have not had to reimburse any of our clients for any judgments or settlements to third parties related to these indemnification provisions pertaining to intellectual property infringement claims. For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the terms of the corresponding agreements with our clients, we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnification provisions. 
    
  In addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including for example, employment disputes and litigation alleging solution defects, personal injury, intellectual property infringement, violations of law and breaches of contract and warranties.  Many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages and many seek an indeterminate amount of damages. 
    
  No less than quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. We accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable, and accruals are based only on the information available to our management at the time the judgment is made. Furthermore, the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, and we may incur substantial defense costs and expenses defending any of these matters. Should any one or a combination of more than one of these proceedings be successful, or should we determine to settle any or a combination of these matters, we may be required to pay substantial sums, become subject to the entry of an injunction or be forced to change the manner in which we operate our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

(10) Segment Reporting 
    
  We have two operating segments, Domestic and Global. Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of clinical, financial and administrative information systems and solutions. The cost of revenues includes the cost of third party consulting services, computer hardware, devices and sublicensed software purchased from manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. Operating expenses incurred by the geographic business segments consist of sales and client service expenses including salaries of sales and client service personnel, expenses associated with our managed services business, marketing expenses, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses.  Other  includes expenses that have not been allocated to the operating segments, such as software development, general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs and related adjustments, share-based compensation expense, and certain amortization and depreciation. Performance of the segments is assessed at the operating earnings level by our chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer. Items such as interest, income taxes, capital expenditures and total assets are managed at the consolidated level and thus are not included in our operating segment disclosures. Accounting policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those used on a consolidated basis. 
    
  The following table presents a summary of our operating segments and other expense for the three and   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  :

  Management Overview 
  Our revenues are primarily derived by selling, implementing and supporting software solutions, clinical content, hardware, devices and services that give health care providers secure access to clinical, administrative and financial data in real or near-real time, helping them improve quality, safety and efficiency in the delivery of health care. 
    
  Our fundamental strategic focus is the creation of organic growth by investing in research and development (R D) to create solutions and services for the health care industry. This strategy has driven strong growth over the long-term, as reflected in five- and ten-year compound annual revenue growth rates of 14% or more. This growth has also created an important strategic footprint in health care, with   Cerner        solutions in more than 25,000 facilities worldwide, including hospitals, physician

     Table of Contents  

practices, laboratories, ambulatory centers, behavioral health centers, cardiac facilities, radiology clinics, surgery centers, extended care facilities, retail pharmacies, and employer sites. Selling additional solutions back into this client base is an important element of our future revenue growth. We are also focused on driving growth through market share expansion by strategically aligning with health care providers that have not yet selected a supplier and by displacing competitors in health care settings that are looking to replace their current supplier. We may also supplement organic growth with acquisitions. 
    
  We expect to drive growth through solutions and services that reflect our ongoing ability to innovate and expand our reach into health care. Examples of these include our   CareAware        health care device architecture and devices,   Cerner ITWorks   SM    services, revenue cycle solutions and services, and population health solutions and services. Finally, we believe there is significant opportunity for growth outside of the United States, with many non-U.S. markets focused on health care information technology as part of their strategy to improve the quality and lower the cost of health care. 
    
  Beyond our strategy for driving revenue growth, we are also focused on earnings growth. Similar to our history of growing revenue, our net earnings have increased at compound annual rates of 17% or more over the most recent five- and ten-year periods. We expect to drive continued earnings growth through ongoing revenue growth coupled with margin expansion, which we expect to achieve through efficiencies in our implementation and operational processes and by leveraging R D investments and controlling general and administrative expenses. 
    
  We are also focused on continuing to deliver strong levels of cash flow, which we expect to accomplish by continuing to grow earnings and prudently managing capital expenditures. 
    
  Siemens Health Services 
  On February 2, 2015, we acquired Siemens Health Services (now referred to as "Cerner Health Services"), as further described in Note (2) of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. The addition of the Cerner Health Services business impacts the comparability of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , in relation to the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015  , presented herein. 
    
  Results Overview 
  The Company delivered strong levels of bookings, revenues, earnings, and operating cash flow in the   third   quarter of   2016  . 
    
  New business bookings revenue, which reflects the value of executed contracts for software, hardware, professional services and managed services, was $1.4 billion in the   third   quarter of   2016  , which is a decrease of 10% compared to $1.6 billion in the   third   quarter of   2015  , when bookings grew 44% year-over-year. 
    
  Revenues for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased   5%   to   $1.2 billion   compared to   $1.1 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The year-over-year increase in revenue reflects ongoing demand for Cerner's core solutions and services driven by our clients' needs to keep up with regulatory requirements; contributions from   Cerner ITWorks   SM    and revenue cycle solutions and services; and attaining new clients. 
    
  Third   quarter   2016   net earnings increased   15%   to   $170 million   compared to   $147 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Diluted earnings per share increased   17%   to   $0.49   compared to   $0.42   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The growth in net earnings and diluted earnings per share was primarily a result of increased revenues, combined with a decline in costs associated with our acquisition of the Cerner Health Services business in 2015. 
    
  We had cash collections of receivables of   $1.3 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $1.1 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Days sales outstanding was   76   days for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   74   days for the second quarter of   2016   and   85   days for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Operating cash flows for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $240 million   compared to   $272 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .

Revenues   Backlog 
  Revenues increased   5%   to   $1.2 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , as compared to   $1.1 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 

System sales, which include revenues from the sale of licensed software (including perpetual license sales and software as a service), technology resale (hardware, devices, and sublicensed software), deployment period licensed software upgrade rights, installation fees, transaction processing and subscriptions, decreased   7%   to   $301 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $325 million   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in system sales was primarily driven by declines in licensed software and technology resale of $18 million and $17 million, respectively. 
                
    Support and maintenance revenues increased   3%   to   $253 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $245 million   during the same period in   2015  . This increase was primarily attributable to continued success selling   Cerner Millennium        applications and implementing them at client sites. 
                
    Services revenue, which includes professional services, excluding installation, and managed services, increased   13%   to   $608 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   $539 million   for the same period in   2015  . This increase was driven by a $39 million increase in professional services due to growth in implementation and consulting activities and growth in managed services of $30 million as a result of continued demand for our hosting services. 
       
  Revenue backlog, which reflects contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized as revenue, increased 11% to $15.5 billion in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to $13.9 billion for the same period in   2015  .  This increase was driven by growth in new business bookings during the past four quarters, including continued strong levels of managed services,   Cerner     ITWorks   SM    and revenue cycle services bookings that typically have longer contract terms.

Costs of Revenue 
  Cost of revenues as a percent of total revenues was   15%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with   17%   in the same period of   2015  . The lower cost of revenues as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by a lower mix of technology resale, which carries a higher cost of revenue. 
  Cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, sales commissions, third party consulting services and subscription content and computer hardware, devices and sublicensed software purchased from manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, devices, maintenance, support, services and reimbursed travel) carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. Cost of revenues does not include the costs of our client service personnel who are responsible for delivering our service offerings. Such costs are included in sales and client service expense. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Total operating expenses increased   5%   to   $759 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared with   $722 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 

Sales and client service expenses as a percent of total revenues were   43%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   41%   in the same period of   2015  . These expenses increased   10%   to   $513 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , from   $466 million   in the same period of   2015  . Sales and client service expenses include salaries and benefits of sales, marketing, support, and services personnel, depreciation and other expenses associated with our managed services business, communications expenses, unreimbursed travel expenses, expense for share-based payments, and trade show and advertising costs. The increase as a percent of revenues reflects a higher mix of services during the quarter that was driven by services revenue growth. 
                
    Software development expenses as a percent of total revenues were   12%   in the   third   quarter of both   2016   and   2015  . Expenditures for software development include ongoing development and enhancement of the   Cerner Millennium          and   HealtheIntent   T    M    platforms, with a focus on supporting key initiatives to enhance physician experience, revenue cycle and population health solutions.

General and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses, professional fees, depreciation and amortization, transaction gains or losses on foreign currency, expense for share-based payments, acquisition costs and related adjustments. The decrease as a percent of revenues was primarily the result of expenses incurred in 2015 related to our voluntary separation plan and acquisition costs and related adjustments associated with our acquisition of the Cerner Health Services business of $4 million and $6 million, respectively. We expect to record expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with a new voluntary separation plan, as further discussed in Note (1) of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles as a percent of total revenues was   2%   in the   third   quarter of both   2016   and   2015  . These expenses decreased   7%   to   $23 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , from   $25 million   for the same period in   2015  . Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles includes the amortization of customer relationships, acquired technology, trade names, and non-compete agreements recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The decrease in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles includes the impact of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.

These expenses increased   1%   to   $68 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , from   $67 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase was primarily driven by the additional month of amortization in the first   nine   months of 2016, on intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisition of the Cerner Health Services business, as compared to the same period in   2015  . 
       
  Non-Operating Items 

Other income (expense), net increased to   $4 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   from   $(1) million   in the same period of   2015  . This increase is primarily due to increased capitalization of interest on construction in process, primarily related to our Innovations Campus (office space development located in Kansas City, Missouri, formerly referred to as our Trails Campus).

     Table of Contents  

Our effective tax rate was   30.7%   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   32.6%   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate is primarily the result of the permanent reinstatement of the U.S. research and development tax credit in December 2015. 
       
  Operations by Segment 
    
  The following table presents a summary of the operating segment information for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  : 

Domestic Segment 
             
    Revenues increased   9%   to   $3.1 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2016   from   $2.9 billion   in the same period of   2015  . This increase was primarily driven by growth in services revenue. 
                
    Cost of revenues as a percent of revenues was   16%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   17%   in the same period of   2015  . The lower cost of revenues as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by a lower mix of technology resale, which carries a higher cost of revenue. 
                
    Operating expenses as a percent of revenues were   42%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   40%   in the same period of   2015  . The increase as a percent of revenues reflects a higher mix of services during the quarter that was driven by services revenue growth. 
       
  Global Segment 
              
    Cost of revenues as a percent of revenues was   19%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   18%   in the same period of   2015  . The higher cost of revenues in 2016 was primarily driven by a higher amount of third party resources utilized for support and services. 
                
    Operating expenses as a percent of revenues were   45%   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   44%   in the same period in 2015. The increase as a percent of revenues is primarily due to increased personnel costs. 
       
  Other, net 
  These expenses decreased   4%   to   $787 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   from   $816 million   in the same period of   2015  . This decrease was primarily the result of expenses incurred in 2015 related to our voluntary separation plan and acquisition costs and related adjustments associated with our acquisition of the Cerner Health Services business of $45 million and $40 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in corporate and development personnel costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and timing of our revenues, our cash collections from our clients and the amount we invest in software development, acquisitions and capital expenditures. 
  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of less than 90 days, and short-term investments. At   October 1, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $431 million   and short-term investments of   $261 million  , as compared to cash and cash equivalents of   $402 million   and short-term investments of   $111 million   at   January 2, 2016  . 
  The non-U.S. subsidiaries for which we have elected to indefinitely reinvest earnings outside of the U.S. held approximately 26% of our aggregate cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at   October 1, 2016  .  As part of our current business strategy, we plan to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of these foreign operations; however, should the earnings of these foreign operations be repatriated, we would accrue and pay tax on such earnings, which may be material. 
    
  We maintain a   $100 million   multi-year revolving credit facility, which expires in October 2020. The facility provides an unsecured revolving line of credit for working capital purposes, along with a letter of credit facility.  We have the ability to increase the maximum capacity to $200 million at any time during the facility's term, subject to lender participation.  As of   October 1, 2016  , we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility; however, we had   $31 million   of outstanding letters of credit, which reduced our available borrowing capacity to   $69 million  . 
    
  We believe that our present cash position, together with cash generated from operations, short-term investments and, if necessary, our available line of credit, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months. 
  The following table summarizes our cash flows in the first   nine     months of   2016   and   2015  : 

Cash from Operating Activities 

Cash flow from operations increased   $228 million   in the first   nine     months of   2016   when compared to the same period of   2015   due to an increase in cash impacting earnings, along with a reduction in cash used to fund working capital requirements. During the first   nine     months of   2016   and   2015  , we received total client cash collections of   $3.8 billion   and   $3.2 billion  , respectively. Days sales outstanding was   76   days in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   74   days in the second quarter of   2016   and   85   days in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements represent recurring cash flows. We expect these revenues to continue to grow as the base of installed systems grows. 

25 

     Table of Contents  

We expect cash payments in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with a new voluntary separation plan, as further discussed in Note (1) of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Cash from Investing Activities 

Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of capital spending, short-term investment, and acquisition activities. 
    
  Our capital spending in the first   nine     months of   2016   was driven by capitalized equipment purchases primarily to support growth in our managed services business, investments in a cloud infrastructure to support cloud-based solutions, building and improvement purchases to support our facilities requirements and capitalized spending to support our ongoing software development initiatives. Capital spending in   2016   is expected to remain elevated as we continue our current capital and software development initiatives, including the construction on our Innovations Campus. 
    
  Short-term investment activity historically consists of the investment of cash generated by our business in excess of what is necessary to fund operations.  In the first   nine     months of 2015 we had a net cash inflow from investments due to the use of proceeds from investment sales and maturities to partially fund our February 2, 2015 acquisition of the Cerner Health Services business. In 2016, we returned to net purchases of investments, which we expect to continue in subsequent periods, as we expect strong levels of cash flow. 
    
  On February 2, 2015, we acquired the Cerner Health Services business, and paid cash consideration of $1.37 billion in the first   nine     months of 2015. We used a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments to fund the acquisition. We expect to continue seeking and completing strategic business acquisitions that are complementary to our business. Refer to Note (2) of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our acquisition of the Cerner Health Services business. 
    
  Cash from Financing Activities 

In January 2015, we issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. Proceeds from the Senior Notes are available for general corporate purposes. We do not expect to issue additional long-term debt in   2016  . 
    
  Cash inflows from stock option exercises are dependent on a number of factors, including the price of our common stock, grant activity under our stock option and equity plans, and overall market volatility. We expect cash inflows from stock option exercises to continue throughout   2016   based on the number of exercisable options as of   October 1, 2016   and our current stock price. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we repurchased 3.7 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program for total consideration of $200 million.  At   October 1, 2016  , $100 million remains available for repurchase under the current program. We may continue to repurchase shares under this program in   2016  , which will be dependent on a number  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

of factors, including the price of our common stock.  Refer to Note (8) of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our share repurchase program. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we repurchased 3.2 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs for total consideration of $200 million. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we paid $2 million of contingent consideration related to our acquisition of InterMedHx, LLC. During the first   nine   months of   2015  , we paid an aggregate of $11 million of contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of InterMedHx, LLC and Kaufman   Keen, LLC (doing business as PureWellness). We do not expect additional contingent consideration payments for the remainder of   2016  . 
    
  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) 

Free cash flow increased $131 million in the first   nine     months of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase is primarily due to increased cash from operations, partially offset by both capital spending to support our growth initiatives and facilities requirements, and increased capitalized spending to support our ongoing software development initiatives. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management along with GAAP results to analyze our earnings quality and overall cash generation of the business.  We define free cash flow as cash flows from operations reduced by capital purchases and capitalized software development costs.  The table above sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow.  The presentation of free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results, and investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Free cash flow may also be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.  We believe free cash flow is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance, because free cash flow takes into account certain capital expenditures necessary to operate our business.

Table of Contents  

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  No material changes. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
           a) 
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
       
  The Company s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q (the Evaluation Date). They have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, these disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within those entities and would be disclosed on a timely basis. The CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed, and are effective, to give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. They have also concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to the Company s management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
           b) 
    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
       
  There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended   October 1, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 
    
           c) 
    Limitations on Controls. 
       
  The Company s management, including its CEO and CFO, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at that reasonable assurance level. However, the Company s management can provide no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting can prevent all errors and all fraud under all circumstances. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been or will be detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  The table below provides information with respect to Common Stock purchases by the Company during the   third   fiscal quarter of   2016  . 

(a) 
    All of the 11,987 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, presented in the table above were originally granted to employees as restricted stock pursuant to our 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan"). The Omnibus Plan allows for the withholding of shares to satisfy the minimum tax obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock. Pursuant to the Omnibus Plan, the shares reflected above were relinquished by employees in exchange for our agreement to pay U.S. federal and state withholding obligations resulting from the vesting of the Company s restricted stock. 
       
           (b) 
    As announced on March 8, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase of up to $300 million of our common stock, excluding transaction costs. As of October 1, 2016, $100 million remained available for repurchase. No time limit has been set for completion of the program. Refer to Note (8) of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our share repurchase program.
