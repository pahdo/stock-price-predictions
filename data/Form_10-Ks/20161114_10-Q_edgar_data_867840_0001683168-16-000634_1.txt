PRECISION OPTICS CORPORATION, INC.  

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)  

1.  
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Principles of Consolidation and Operations  

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Precision Optics Corporation, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the  Company ).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

These consolidated financial statements have
been prepared by the Company, without audit, and reflect normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are
necessary for a fair statement of the results of the first quarter of the Company s fiscal year 2017. These consolidated
financial statements do not include all disclosures associated with annual consolidated financial statements and, accordingly,
should be read in conjunction with footnotes contained in the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended
June 30, 2016 together with the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm filed under cover of the Company s
2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2016. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. 

Income (Loss) Per Share  

Basic income (loss) per share is computed by
dividing net income or net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income or net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period, plus the number of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period such as stock options
and warrants. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of such securities was antidilutive and not included
in the diluted calculation because of the net loss generated in these periods. 

The following is the calculation of loss per share for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The number of shares issuable upon the exercise
of outstanding stock options and warrants that were excluded from the computation as their effect was antidilutive was approximately
4,169,000 and 4,349,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Income Taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

In assessing the likelihood of utilization
of existing deferred tax assets, management has considered historical results of operations and the current operating environment.
Based on this evaluation, a full valuation reserve has been provided for the deferred tax assets. 

2.   
       INVENTORIES    

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market and consisted of the following: 

3.  
       CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION    

The Company entered into a five-year capital lease obligation in
January 2016 for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment totaling $51,252. At September 30, 2016, future minimum lease payments
under the capital lease obligation are as follows: 

4.  
       STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION    

Stock-based compensation costs recognized during
the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $60,901 and $100,323, respectively, and the costs were included in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations in: selling, general and administrative expenses (2016 - $42,915; 2015 - $36,257),
research and development expenses (2016 - $9,317; 2015 - $29,391) and cost of goods sold (2016 - $8,669; 2015 - $34,675). No stock-based
compensation has been capitalized because such amounts would have been immaterial. 

There were no stock option grants in the quarter
ended September 30, 2016. 

Information related to the stock options outstanding
as of September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

The aggregate intrinsic value of the Company s
 in-the-money  outstanding and exercisable options as of September 30, 2016 was $25,140.  

5.  
       SALE OF STOCK    

On October 19, 2015, the Company entered into
agreements with accredited investors for the sale and purchase of 1,044,776 shares of the Company s common stock, $0.01 par
value at a purchase price of $0.67 per share. The Company received $700,000 in gross proceeds from the offering. The Company used
the majority of the net proceeds from this placement for general working capital purposes. 

In conjunction with the placement, the Company
also entered into a registration rights agreement with the investors, and in compliance with the terms of the agreement the registration
statement was filed on January 19, 2016 and became effective on February 1, 2016. 

In conjunction with the offering, certain anti-dilution
provisions of the warrants issued in conjunction with the Company s June 25, 2008 and September 28, 2012 financing transactions
were triggered. As a result, the number of existing June 25, 2008 warrants increased from 493,398 to 517,222 and the related exercise
price of the warrants decreased from $1.03 to $0.98 per share. Also, as a result of the offering, the number of existing September
28, 2012 warrants increased from 2,189,724 to 2,293,013 and 217,322 to 222,559, respectively, and the related exercise price decreased
from $1.11 to $1.06 and from $0.85 to $0.83, respectively. 

6.  
       SALE OF ASSETS    

During the quarters ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company sold equipment that was previously written off for proceeds totaling $315 and $1,566, respectively, and recorded
gains of $315 and $1,566, respectively, which are included within operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

The following discussion of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016
and with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K,
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2016.  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
contains forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the   words  anticipate,   suggest, 
 estimate,     plan,   project,   continue,   ongoing,   potential, 
 expect,   predict,     believe,   intend,   may,   will, 
 should,   could,   would  and similar   expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  Our actual results could differ materially
from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in this report, the risks
described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 and other reports we file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, they relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We do not intend to update any
of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in
our expectations, except as required by law.  

Overview  

We have been a developer and manufacturer of
advanced optical instruments since 1982. Today, the vast majority of our business is the design and manufacture of high-quality
medical devices and approximately 5% of our business is the design and manufacture of military and industrial products. Our medical
instrumentation line includes traditional endoscopes and endocouplers as well as other custom imaging and illumination products
for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures. Much of our recent development efforts have been targeted at the development
of next generation endoscopes. For the last ten years, we have funded internal research and development programs to develop next
generation capabilities for designing and manufacturing 3D endoscopes and very small Microprecision  lenses, anticipating
future requirements as the surgical community continues to demand smaller and more enhanced imaging systems for minimally invasive
surgery. 

Our unique proprietary technology in the areas
of micro optical lenses and prisms, micro medical fiber and CMOS based cameras, and custom design of medical grade instruments,
combined with recent developments in the areas of 3D displays, has allowed us to begin commercialization of related product and
service offerings to a widening group of customers addressing various medical device, defense and aerospace applications. We believe
that new products based on these technologies provide enhanced optical and imaging qualities for many uses including existing surgical
procedures and development of new procedures enabled by the small size and image quality of our camera modules. 

We are registered to the ISO 9001:2008
and ISO 13485:2003 Quality Standards and comply with the FDA Good Manufacturing Practices and the European Union Medical Device
Directive for CE marking of our medical products. Our internet website is www.poci.com. Information on our website is not intended
to be integrated into this report. 

The markets in which we do business are highly
competitive and include both foreign and domestic competitors. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater
resources than we do. Furthermore, other domestic or foreign companies, some with greater financial resources than we have, may
seek to produce products or services that compete with ours. We routinely outsource specialized production efforts as required
to obtain the most cost effective production. Over the years, we have achieved extensive experience collaborating with other optical
specialists worldwide and since the 1990s, we have maintained a presence in Asia, specifically Hong Kong, to support business and
quality control activities throughout the region as needed. 

We believe that competition for sales of our
medical products and services, which have been principally sold to original equipment manufacturers, or OEM, customers, is based
on our ability to design and produce technical features, performance, engineering service and production scheduling, on-time delivery,
quality control and product reliability, and competitive pricing. 

We believe that our future success depends
to a large degree on our ability to develop new optical products and services to enhance the performance characteristics and methods
of manufacture of existing products. Accordingly, we expect to continue to seek and obtain product-related design and development
contracts with customers and to selectively invest our own funds on research and development, particularly in the areas of Microprecision 
optics, micro medical cameras and 3D endoscopes. 

For the year ended June 30, 2016, approximately
62% of our sales were made to seven customers. Of these, three are large, international, medical device companies who have been
our customers for many years. These three customers continue to purchase products that we developed over five years ago, and both
now purchase new products that were developed and launched into production by us more recently. The other four top customers purchase
products that we developed in recent years, and which rely heavily on our unique, proprietary Microprecision  lens technology
and optical visualization system expertise. 

Current sales and marketing activities are
intended to broaden awareness of the benefits of our new technology platforms, which we believe are ready for general application
to medical device projects requiring surgery-grade visualization from sub-millimeter sized devices and 3D endoscopy. We market
directly to established medical device companies primarily in the United States that we believe could benefit from our advanced
endoscopy visualization systems. Through this direct marketing, referrals, attendance at trade shows and a presence in online professional
association websites, we have expanded our on-going pipeline of projects to significant medical device companies as well as well-funded
emerging technology companies. We expect our customer pipeline to continue to expand as development projects transition to production
orders and new customer projects enter the development phase. 

We continue to attend trade shows to announce
our new technology, most recently at the Medical Design and Manufacturing West show in Anaheim in February 2016, and at the MD M
East show in June 2016 in New York City. Beginning in fiscal year 2014, we have advertised through, and received numerous leads
from a business-to-business e-commerce platform. Photonics Online, www.photonicsonline.com, has a target audience of optical engineering
design and manufacturing professionals and has over 34,000 subscribers to their monthly email newsletter. Because of the increased
awareness of our new technology generated by our presence at trade shows, advertising on Photonics Online and direct email messages
to our own customer database that we have built over the last 30 years, we more than doubled the rate that we received requests
for quotes during fiscal year 2014 with increased requests from potential customers for project quotations in fiscal year 2016.
We do not intend for the information on either the Photonics Online or any other websites to be incorporated into this report.  

General   

This management s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. 

There have been no significant changes in our
critical accounting policies as disclosed in the Notes to our Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2016.  

Results of Operations  

Our total revenues for the quarter ended September
30, 2016, the first quarter of our fiscal year 2017, were $849,548, as compared to $858,427 for the same fiscal quarter in the
prior year, a decrease of $8,879, or 1.0%. The slight decrease in revenues in the current quarter compared to last year reflects
a 68% increase in engineering service revenues from numerous projects involving our CMOS and Micoprecision  product technologies.
The offsetting net decrease in production revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 includes revenue increases in certain
traditional coupler, endoscope and optical assemblies, and larger decreases in laryngoscopes, a CMOS camera assembly and optical
components. We believe the increase in engineering services revenue is a positive indication of future production revenue opportunities,
and that with the exception of one lost production contract, the variations in other production revenues are consistent with our
customers  historical purchasing activity. 

Revenues from our largest customers, as a percentage
of our total revenues, for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were as follows: 

No other customer accounted for more than 10%
of our revenues during those quarters. 

Gross profit for the quarter ended September
30, 2016 was $167,051, as compared to $132,338 for the same period in the prior year, which reflects an increase of $34,713. Gross
profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as a percentage of our revenues was 19.7%, an increase from the gross profit percentage
of 15.4% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in our gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher margins
on manufacturing revenue and a decrease in non cash stock based compensation charged to cost of goods sold in the first quarter
of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period of the prior year, partially offset by lower margins on engineering revenue in the
current quarter compared to the same period of the prior year. Our quarterly gross profit and gross profit percentage depend on
a number of factors, including overall sales volume and mix of products sold and services provided, including the costs of new
product engineering design services and new product start-up production activities, and therefore varies from quarter to quarter
at the current sales levels. 

Research and development expenses were $116,992
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $150,768 for the same period in the prior year, which reflects a decrease
of $33,776, or 22.4%. The decrease in research and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to same period in the prior year, was primarily due to higher labor costs charged to costs of goods sold in connection with engineering
service revenue activities in the current quarter, and lower non-cash stock based compensation expense charged to research and
development compared to the same period of the prior year. Research and development expenses include stock based compensation expense
of $9,317 and $29,391 during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses
were $343,782 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $365,026 for the same period in the prior year, which reflects
a decrease of $21,244, or 5.8%. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September
30, 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to reduced costs relating to consulting fees, advertising
and legal costs offset by higher consulting related travel costs and cash stock based compensation charges. 

No income tax provision was recorded in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2016 or 2015 because of the losses generated in those periods.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We have sustained recurring net losses for
several years. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $293,408 and generated cash from operating
activities of $157,788. As of September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $202,406, accounts receivable were $566,053, and
current liabilities were $1,555,477. We incurred a net loss of $381,890 during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 and used cash
in operating activities of $125,084. During the year ended June 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss from operations of $1,055,434
and used cash in operating activities of $876,298. As of June 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $50,059, accounts receivable
were $750,380, and current liabilities were $1,503,961. 

We have traditionally funded working capital
needs through product sales, management of working capital components of our business, and by cash received from public and private
offerings of our common stock, warrants to purchase shares of our common stock or convertible notes. We have incurred quarter to
quarter operating losses during our efforts to develop current products including Microprecision  optical elements, micro
medical camera assemblies and 3D endoscopes. Our management believes that the opportunities represented by these products have
the potential to generate sales increases to achieve breakeven and profitable results. 

Until we achieve and sustain breakeven and
profitable results, we will be required to pursue several options to manage cash flow and raise capital, including issuing debt
or equity or entering into a strategic alliance. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in additional
dilution to our current stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could restrict our
operations or finances. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to
secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and take additional measures
to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. If we cannot
raise funds on acceptable terms or achieve positive cash flow, we may not be able to continue to develop new products, grow market
share, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, any of which could
negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition, or impact our ability to continue to conduct operations
as a going concern. 

On October 19, 2015, we closed agreements with
institutional and accredited investors for the sale and purchase of 1,044,776 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of
$0.67 per share. We received $700,000 in gross proceeds from the offering. We are using the net proceeds from this placement for
general working capital purposes. 

Capital equipment expenditures during the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $3,500 and $4,372, respectively. Future capital equipment expenditures will be dependent
upon future sales and success of on-going research and development efforts. 

Contractual cash commitments for the fiscal
years subsequent to September 30, 2016 are summarized as follows: 

We have contractual cash commitments related
to open purchase orders as of September 30, 2016 of approximately $175,000. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk.  

As a smaller reporting company, as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting
obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, were not effective, as of September
30, 2016, to ensure the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure
controls and procedures are intended to be designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not
effective as of September 30, 2016. 

The following is a description of two material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting: 

Segregation of Duties : As previously
disclosed in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008-2016, our management identified a control
deficiency during the 2008 fiscal year because we lacked sufficient staff to segregate accounting duties. We believe the control
deficiency resulted primarily because we have the equivalent of one and one-half persons performing all accounting-related on-site
duties. As a result, we did not maintain adequate segregation of duties within our critical financial reporting applications, the
related modules and financial reporting processes. This control deficiency could result in a misstatement of balance sheet and
income statement accounts in our interim or annual consolidated financial statements that would not be detected. Accordingly, management
has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. During the period beginning with fiscal year 2008
through June 30, 2016, no audit adjustments resulting from this condition were required. 

To address and remediate the material weakness
in internal control over financial reporting described above, beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2008, we instituted
a procedure whereby our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our Board of Directors perform
a higher level review of the quarterly and annual reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K prior to filing. 

We believe that the step outlined above strengthens
our internal control over financial reporting and mitigates the material weakness described above. As part of our assessment of
internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, our management has evaluated this additional
control and has determined that it is operating effectively. 

Inventory Valuation : As previously disclosed
in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009-2016, we reported a material weakness with respect
to the valuation of our inventories. Specifically, the amounts used to value our inventory at June 30, 2009 with respect to overhead
rates and purchased items were often inconsistent with the supporting documentation, due to year-to-year changes in overhead rates
and costs of purchased items that were not properly reflected in inventory valuation. Accordingly, management had determined that
this control deficiency constituted a material weakness as of June 30, 2009. One audit adjustment of approximately $58,000 to our
audited financial statements as of June 30, 2011 was necessary as a result of this condition. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   

There was no change in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of our fiscal year covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

To address and remediate the material weakness
in internal control over financial reporting described above, beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and continuing
through the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we implemented processes to improve our inventory controls and documentation surrounding
inventory valuation for overhead rates, and performed procedures to ensure that the pricing of inventory items was consistent with
the supporting documentation. We believe that the step outlined above strengthens our internal control over financial reporting
and mitigates the material weakness described above. 

We intend to continue to remediate material
weaknesses and enhance our internal controls but cannot guarantee that our efforts will result in remediation of our material weaknesses
or that new issues will not be exposed in this process. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

Our Company, on occasion, may be involved in
legal matters arising in the ordinary course of our business. While management believes that such matters are currently insignificant,
matters arising in the ordinary course of business for which we are or could become involved in litigation may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are not aware of any pending or threatened
litigation against us or our officers and directors in their capacity as such that could have a material impact on our operations
or finances. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

There have been no material changes from the
risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, as filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2016.

and Use of Proceeds.

in the quarter ended September 30, 2016.
