DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Form 10-Q ) contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including but not limited to statements about our estimates, expectations, plans, objectives, strategies, and financial condition, expected impact of regulatory developments and legal proceedings, opportunities in our industries and businesses and other trends and projections for the next fiscal quarter and beyond.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements may also be identified by words such as  anticipate,   intend,   plan,   goal,   seek,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   predict,   continue,   future,   will,   would,   could,   can,   may  and similar terms.  These forward-looking statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Form 10-Q and represent management s current views and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, events or results and involve potential known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which may be beyond our control and may pose a risk to our operating and financial condition.  Accordingly, actual performance, events or results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors including, but not limited to:  

our reliance on our primary customer, DISH Network Corporation and its subsidiaries ( DISH Network ), for a significant portion of our revenue; 

our ability to implement our strategic initiatives; 

our ability to bring advanced technologies to market to keep pace with our customers and competitors; 

risk related to our foreign operations and other uncertainties associated with doing business internationally, including changes in foreign exchange rates between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, economic instability and political disturbances; 

significant risks related to the construction, launch and operation of our satellites, such as the risk of material malfunction on one or more of our satellites, risks resulting from delays of launches of our satellites, changes in the space weather environment that could interfere with the operation of our satellites, and our general lack of commercial insurance coverage on our satellites; 

our failure to adequately anticipate the need for satellite capacity or the inability to obtain satellite capacity for our Hughes segment; and 

the failure of third-party providers of components, manufacturing, installation services and customer support services to appropriately deliver the contracted goods or services. 
       
  Other factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption  Risk Factors  in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Form 10-K ) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), those discussed in  Management s Narrative Analysis of Results of Operations  herein and in our Form 10-K, and those discussed in other documents we file with the SEC. 
    
  All cautionary statements made herein should be read as being applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear.  Investors should consider the risks and uncertainties described herein and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.  We do not undertake, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
    
  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  We do not assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward looking statements.  We assume no responsibility for updating forward looking information contained or incorporated by reference herein or in any documents we file with the SEC.    
    
  Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described herein or in any documents we file with the SEC occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.

  (Unaudited) 

Note 1.                         Organization and Business Activities 
    
  Principal Business 
    
  Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation (which, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as  HSS,  the  Company,   we,   us  and/or  our ) is a holding company and a subsidiary of EchoStar Corporation ( EchoStar ).  We are a global provider of satellite service operations, video delivery solutions, broadband satellite technologies and broadband services for home and office customers.  We deliver innovative network technologies, managed services, and various communications solutions for enterprise and government customers. 
    
  We currently operate in the following   two   business segments: 

Hughes     which provides broadband satellite technologies and broadband services to home and office customers and network technologies, managed services and communication solutions to domestic and international consumer, enterprise and government customers.  The Hughes segment also provides managed services, hardware, and satellite services to large enterprises and government customers, and designs, provides and installs gateway and terminal equipment to customers for other satellite systems.    

EchoStar Satellite Services ( ESS )     which uses certain of our owned and leased in-orbit satellites and related licenses to provide satellite service operations and video delivery solutions on a full-time and occasional-use basis primarily to DISH Network Corporation and its subsidiaries ( DISH Network ), Dish Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. ( Dish Mexico ), a joint venture that EchoStar entered into in 2008, United States ( U.S. ) government service providers, internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, programmers, and private enterprise customers.   
       
  We were formed as a Colorado corporation in March 2011 to facilitate the acquisition (the  Hughes Acquisition ) of Hughes Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Hughes Communications ) and related financing transactions.  In connection with our formation, EchoStar contributed the assets and liabilities of its satellite services business, including the principal operating subsidiary of its satellite services business, EchoStar Satellite Services L.L.C., to us.  In addition, as a result of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction described in Note 3 below and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, DISH Network owns shares of our preferred tracking stock representing a   28.11%   economic interest in the residential retail satellite broadband business of our Hughes segment.  DISH Network also owns shares of preferred tracking stock issued by EchoStar Corporation, which together with our preferred tracking stock represents an aggregate   80.0%   economic interest in the residential retail satellite broadband business of our Hughes segment.  The tracking stock is an equity security and the rights of DISH Network, as the holder of the tracking stock, in our assets are subject to the claims of our creditors. 

Note 2.                         Summary     of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements   have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information.  Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required for complete financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP.  In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Our results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended     December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  We consolidate all entities in which we have a controlling financial interest.  We are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary.  We are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in other entities when we own more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares and other shareholders do not have substantive rights to participate in management.  For entities we control but do not wholly own, we record a noncontrolling

     Table of Contents  
  HUGHES SATELLITE SYSTEMS CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 
  (Unaudited) 

interest within   shareholders    equity for the portion of the entity s equity attributed to the noncontrolling ownership interests.    All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheets, the reported amounts of revenue and expense for each reporting period, and certain information disclosed in the notes to our   condensed consolidated financial statements.      Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, amortization periods for deferred subscriber acquisition costs, revenue recognition using the percentage-of-completion method, allowances for doubtful accounts, allowances for sales returns and rebates, warranty obligations, self-insurance obligations, deferred taxes and related valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, loss contingencies, fair value of financial instruments, fair value of   EchoStar s   stock-based compensation awards, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, lease classifications, asset impairment testing, useful lives and methods for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, and certain royalty obligations.  We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience, observable market inputs and on various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts, and such differences may be material to our   condensed consolidated financial statements.      Changing economic conditions may increase the inherent uncertainty in the estimates and assumptions indicated above.  We review our estimates and assumptions periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period they occur or prospectively if the revised estimate affects future periods. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  We determine fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  Market or observable inputs are the preferred source of values, followed by unobservable inputs or assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market inputs.  We utilize the highest level of inputs available according to the following hierarchy in determining fair value: 

Level 1, defined as observable inputs being quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; 

Level 2, defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, consistent with characteristics of the asset or liability that would be considered by market participants in a transaction to purchase or sell the asset or liability. 
       
  Transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy are considered to occur at the beginning of the quarterly accounting period.    There were   no   transfers between levels for each of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, accounts payable and accrued liabilities were equal to or approximated fair value due to their short-term nature or proximity to current market rates. 
    
  Fair values of our current marketable investment securities are based on a variety of observable market inputs.  For our investments in publicly traded equity securities and U.S. government securities, fair value ordinarily is determined based on a Level 1 measurement that reflects quoted prices for identical securities in active markets.  Fair values of our investments in other marketable debt securities generally are based on Level 2 measurements as the markets for such debt securities are less active.  Trades of identical debt securities on or near the measurement date are considered a strong indication of fair value.  Matrix pricing techniques that consider par value, coupon rate, credit quality, maturity and other relevant features also may be used to determine fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities. 
    
  Fair values for our publicly traded debt are based on quoted market prices in less active markets and are categorized as Level 2 measurements.  The fair values of our privately held debt are Level 2 measurements and are estimated to approximate their  
  
   5 

     Table of Contents  
  HUGHES SATELLITE SYSTEMS CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 
  (Unaudited) 

carrying amounts based on the proximity of their interest rates to current market rates.    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of our in-orbit incentive obligations, based on measurements categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, approximated their carrying amounts of   $75.2 million   and   $79.3 million  , respectively.    We use fair value measurements from time to time in connection with impairment testing and the assignment of purchase consideration to assets and liabilities of acquired companies.  Those fair value measurements typically include significant unobservable inputs and are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Research and Development 
    
  Costs incurred in research and development activities generally are expensed as incurred.  A significant portion of our research and development costs are incurred in connection with the specific requirements of a customer s order.  In such instances, the amounts for these customer funded development efforts are included in cost of sales. 
    
  Cost of sales includes research and development costs incurred in connection with customer s orders of approximately   $11.1 million   and   $4.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $17.2 million   and   $15.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  In addition, we incurred other research and development expenses of approximately   $9.0 million   and   $6.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $23.5 million   and   $18.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Capitalized Software Costs 
    
  Costs related to the procurement and development of software for internal-use and externally marketed software are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, not in excess of   five years  .  Capitalized costs of internal-use software are included in  Property and equipment, net  and capitalized costs of externally marketed software are included in  Other noncurrent assets, net  in   our condensed consolidated balance sheets  .  Externally marketed software is generally installed in the equipment we sell to customers.    We conduct software program reviews for externally marketed capitalized software costs at least annually, or as events and circumstances warrant such a review, to determine if capitalized software development costs are recoverable and to ensure that costs associated with programs that are no longer generating revenue are expensed.    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the net carrying amount of externally marketed software was   $73.6 million   and   $62.8 million  , respectively, of which   $45.6 million   and   $32.6 million  , respectively is under development and not yet placed in service.  We capitalized costs related to the development of externally marketed software of   $6.2 million   and   $5.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $18.5 million   and   $17.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We recorded amortization expense relating to the development of externally marketed software of   $2.5 million   and   $2.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $7.2 million   and   $6.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The weighted average useful life of our externally marketed software was approximately   three years   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ).  It outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  The core principle of the revenue model is that  an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.   In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, which deferred the mandatory effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  As a result, public entities are required to adopt the new revenue standard in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and in interim periods within those annual periods.  The standard may be applied either retrospectively to prior periods or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  Early adoption is permitted, but not before annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which amends guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.  In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which addresses collectibility, noncash consideration, completed contracts at transition, a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition, and an accounting policy election related to

the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers.  We have not determined when we will adopt the new revenue standard or selected the transition method that we will apply upon adoption.  We continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard and available adoption methods on our consolidated financial statements.  We are in the process of evaluating arrangements with customers and identifying differences in accounting between new and old standards. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02 ).  This standard amends the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities and general partners  investments in limited partnerships and similar entities.  ASU 2015-02 was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods, and required either a retrospective or a modified retrospective approach as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  We adopted ASU 2015-02 in the first quarter of 2016.  The adoption of the standard did not impact our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ).  This standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums.  ASU 2015-03 was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods, and required a retrospective approach to adoption.  We adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016.  Upon adoption, we presented unamortized debt issuance cost previously reported in  Other noncurrent assets, net  with a carrying amount of     $31.3 million   as of December 31, 2015, as a reduction of our  Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, net of unamortized debt issuance costs . 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ).  This update substantially revises standards for the recognition, measurement and presentation of financial instruments, including requiring all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income.  It also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted for certain requirements.  We are assessing the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02 ).  This standard requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms more than 12 months, including leases classified as operating leases.  The standard also modifies the definition of a lease and the criteria for classifying leases as operating leases or financing leases.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those periods.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are assessing the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment awards.  This update requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit and permits an entity to make an entity-wide policy election to either estimate forfeitures or recognize forfeitures as they occur.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those periods.  The update specifies requirements for retrospective, modified retrospective or prospective application for the various amendments contained in the update.  We are assessing the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13 ), which introduces an approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments.  It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those periods.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are assessing the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory ( ASU 2016-16 ), which improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods

Note 3.                         Hughes Retail Preferred Tracking Stock 
    
  Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction 
    
  In February 2014, HSS and EchoStar entered into agreements with certain subsidiaries of DISH Network pursuant to which, effective March 1, 2014, (i) EchoStar issued shares of its newly authorized Hughes Retail Preferred Tracking Stock (the  EchoStar Tracking Stock ) and HSS issued shares of its newly authorized Hughes Retail Preferred Tracking Stock (the  HSS Tracking Stock  and together with the EchoStar Tracking Stock, the  Tracking Stock ) to DISH Network in exchange for   five   satellites (EchoStar I, EchoStar VII, EchoStar X, EchoStar XI, and EchoStar XIV), including the assumption of related in-orbit incentive obligations, and   $11.4 million   in cash and (ii) DISH Network began receiving certain satellite services on these   five   satellites from us (the  Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction ).  Immediately upon receipt of net assets (consisting of   two   of the five satellites and related in-orbit incentive obligations) from DISH Network in exchange for EchoStar Tracking Stock, EchoStar transferred such net assets to us.  The Tracking Stock tracks the economic performance of the residential retail satellite broadband business of our Hughes segment, including certain operations, assets and liabilities attributed to such business (collectively, the  Hughes Retail Group  or  HRG ).  The shares of the Tracking Stock issued to DISH Network represent an aggregate   80.0%   economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group (the shares issued as   HSS Tracking Stock represent a     28.11%     economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group and the shares issued as     EchoStar Tracking Stock represent a   51.89%   economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group).  In addition to the remaining   20.0%   economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group, HSS retains all economic interest in the wholesale satellite broadband business and other businesses of HSS.  The Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction was consistent with the long-term strategy of the Company to increase the scale of its satellite services business, which provides high-margin revenues, while continuing to benefit from the growth of the satellite broadband business.  As a result of the additional satellites received in the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction, HSS increased short-term cash flow that it believes better positions it to achieve its strategic objectives. 
    
  HSS has adopted a policy statement (the  Policy Statement ) setting forth management and allocation policies for purposes of attributing all of the business and operations of HSS to either the Hughes Retail Group or the  HSSC Group,  which is defined as all other operations of HSS, including all existing and future businesses, other than the Hughes Retail Group.  Among other things, the Policy Statement governs how assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses are attributed or allocated between HRG and the HSSC Group.  Such attributions and allocations generally do not affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, except for the attribution of shareholders  equity and net income or loss between the holders of Tracking Stock and common stock.  The Policy Statement also does not significantly affect the way that management assesses operating performance and allocates resources within our Hughes segment. 
    
  We provide unaudited attributed financial information for HRG and the HSSC Group in an exhibit to our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K.  For a description of the Tracking Stock and the initial recording of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction in our consolidated financial statements, as well as the purpose and effect of the transaction on the Company and holders of shares of HSS common stock, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Note 4.                         Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Related Tax Effects 
    
  We have not recognized any tax effects on foreign currency translation adjustments because they are not expected to result in future taxable income or deductions.  We have not recognized any tax effects on unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities because such gains or losses would affect the amount of existing capital loss carryforwards for which the related deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance. 
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes cumulative foreign currency translation losses of   $43.1 million   and   $53.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

  Our marketable investment securities and investments in unconsolidated entities consisted of the following: 

Marketable Investment Securities 
    
  Our marketable investment securities portfolio consists of various debt and equity instruments, which generally are classified as available-for-sale or trading securities depending on our investment strategy for those securities.  The value of our investment portfolio depends on the value of such securities and other instruments comprising the portfolio. 
    
  Corporate Bonds 
    
  Our corporate bond portfolio includes debt instruments issued by individual corporations, primarily in the industrial and financial services industries.

Strategic Equity Securities 
    
  Our strategic investment portfolio consists of investments in shares of common stock of public companies, which are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility.  We did not receive any dividend income   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,    Gains (losses) on marketable investment securities, net    included losses of   zero   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, related to trading securities that we held as of   September 30, 2016  .  For each of the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,    Gains (losses) on marketable investment securities, net    included losses of   $3.9 million   and   $5.5 million  , respectively, related to trading securities that we held as of   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Other 
    
  Our other current marketable investment securities portfolio includes investments in various debt instruments, including U.S. government bonds  . 
    
  Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Available-for-Sale Securities 
    
  The components of our available-for-sale investments are summarized in the table below. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , restricted and non-restricted available-for-sale securities included debt securities of   $343.9 million   with contractual maturities of one year or less and   $23.6 million   with contractual maturities greater than one year.  We may realize proceeds from certain investments prior to their contractual maturity as a result of our ability to sell these securities prior to their contractual maturity.

Available-for-Sale Securities in a Loss Position 
    
  The following table reflects the length of time that our available-for-sale securities have been in an unrealized loss position.  We do not intend to sell these securities before they recover or mature, and it is more likely than not that we will hold these securities until they recover or mature.  We believe that changes in the estimated fair values of these securities are primarily related to temporary market conditions  . 

Sales of Marketable Investment Securities 
    
  We recognized gains from the sales of our available-for-sale securit  i  es of de minimis and   $3.0 million   for t  he three and     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and de minimis gains for each of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  We recognized de minimis losses from the sales of our available-for-sale securities for each of the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   
    
  Proceeds from sales of our available-for-sale securities totaled   zero   and   $4.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $17.6 million   and   $14.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Our current marketable investment securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as summarized in the table below.    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   we did not have investments that were categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities         Noncurrent 
    
  We have several strategic investments in certain non-publicly traded equity securities that are accounted for using either the equity or the cost method of accounting.  Our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies  businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans.  Because private markets are not as liquid as public markets, there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments, or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them. 
    
  In   June 2016  , we recorded a   $10.0 million   cash distribution from our investment accounted for using the equity method that was determined to be a return on investment and reported in cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

(1) 
    We entered into a satellite services agreement and made prepayments for certain capacity on this satellite once launched, but are not a party to the construction contract. 
       
  Depreciation expense associated with our property and equipment consisted of the following: 

Satellites 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we utilized in support of our operations,   17   of our owned and leased satellites in geosynchronous orbit, approximately 22,300 miles above the equator.  We depreciate our owned satellites on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each satellite.    Three   of our satellites are accounted for as capital leases and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their respective lease terms.  We utilized   one   satellite that is accounted for as an operating lease and not included in property and equipment as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Recent Developments 
    
  Eutelsat 65 West A  .  The Eutelsat 65 West A satellite was launched in March 2016 and our Hughes segment began to offer consumer broadband services in Brazil using our leased Ka-band payload on the satellite in July 2016. 
    
  EchoStar 105/SES-11.      Due to anomalies experienced by our launch provider, the expected launch date of our EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite has been delayed until the first half of 2017.  Our Ku-band payload on the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite will replace our current capacity on the AMC-15 satellite.

Satellite Anomalies 
    
  Our satellites may experience anomalies from time to time, some of which may have a significant adverse impact on their remaining useful lives, the commercial operation of the satellites or our operating results.  We are not aware of any anomalies with respect to our owned or leased satellites that have had any such material adverse effect   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .    There can be no assurance, however, that anomalies will not have any such adverse impacts in the future.  In addition, there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in-orbit satellites were to fail.   

Note 9.                         Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  The excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair values of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets at the time of the acquisition is recorded as goodwill.  Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units within our operating segments and is subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount.         
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all of our goodwill was assigned to reporting units of our Hughes segment.  We test this goodwill for impairment annually in the second quarter.    Based on our qualitative assessment of impairment of   reporting units    goodwill in the second quarter of 2016  , we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the Hughes segment   reporting units were less than the corresponding carrying amounts, including goodwill.  
    
  Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Our other intangible assets, which are subject to amortization, consisted of the following: 

Customer relationships are amortized predominantly in relation to the expected contribution of cash flow to the business over the life of the intangible asset.  Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods the assets are expected to contribute to our cash flows.  Intangible asset amortization expense, including amortization of regulatory authorizations with finite lives and externally marketed capitalized software, was   $11.4 million   and   $11.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $33.7 million   and   $38.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

  The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of our debt: 

The fair values of our debt are estimates categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  On May 6, 2016,   we offered to repurchase for cash all or any part of our outstanding 6 1/2% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the    2019 Senior Secured Notes   ) and our outstanding 7 5/8% Senior Notes due 2021 (the  2021 Senior Unsecured Notes ) at a purchase price equal to   101%     of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of repurchase.

  Subject to certain exceptions, the 2016 Indentures contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, impose limitations on   our   ability and, in certain instances, the ability of certain of   our   subsidiaries to: 

incur additional debt;    
                
    pay dividends or make distributions on   our   capital stock or repurchase   our   capital stock; 
                
    make certain investments; 
                
    create liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;    
                
    enter into transactions with affiliates;    
                
    merge or consolidate with another company;    
                
    transfer and sell assets; and    
                
    allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of certain of   our   subsidiaries to pay dividends, make distributions, make other payments, or transfer assets to   us.  
       
     In the event of a Change of Control, as defined in the 2016 Indentures,   we   would be required to make an offer to repurchase all or any part of a holder s 2026 Notes at a purchase price equal to     101.0%     of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.

The 2016 Indentures provide for customary events of default, including, among other things, nonpayment, breach of the covenants in the 2016 Indentures, payment defaults or acceleration of other indebtedness, a failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization.  If any event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least     25%     in principal amount of the applicable then outstanding 2026 Notes may declare all the applicable 2026 Notes to be due and payable immediately, together with any accrued and unpaid interest.    
    
  As discussed above,   we and certain of our   subsidiaries have granted a first priority security interest in substantially all   our and their assets, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, to secure our   obligations under the 2019 Senior Secured Notes and the 2026 Senior Secured Notes.    
    
  Under the terms of a registration rights agreement,   we have   agreed to register notes having substantially identical terms as the 2026 Notes with the SEC as part of an offer to exchange freely tradable exchange notes for the 2026 Notes    

Note 11.                  Income Taxes 
    
  Our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period.  Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment. 
    
  Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant volatility due to several factors, including income and losses from investments for which we have a full valuation allowance, changes in tax laws and relative changes in unrecognized tax benefits.  Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income.  For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. 
    
  Income tax expense was approximately   $57.3 million   and   $58.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Our estimated effective income tax rate was   36.4%   and   38.3%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The variations in our current year effective tax rate from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were primarily due to the impact of state and local taxes, partially offset by research and experimentation credits.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the variation in our effective tax rate from the U.S. federal statutory rate was primarily due to the impact of state and local taxes. 

Note 12.                  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Commitments 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our satellite-related obligations were approximately   $693.7 million  .  Our satellite-related obligations primarily include payments pursuant to agreements for the construction of the EchoStar XIX, EchoStar XXI, EchoStar XXIII, and EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellites; payments pursuant to launch services contracts and regulatory authorizations, executory costs for our capital lease satellites; costs under satellite service agreements and in-orbit incentives relating to certain satellites; as well as commitments for long-term satellite operating leases and satellite service arrangements.

Contingencies 
    
  Patents and Intellectual Property 
    
  Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services directly or indirectly related to those that we offer.  We may not be aware of all patents and other intellectual property rights that our products and services may potentially infringe.  Damages in patent infringement cases can be substantial, and in certain circumstances can be trebled.  Further, we cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to intellectual property rights held by others and the availability and cost of any such licenses.  Various parties have asserted patent and other intellectual property rights with respect to components within our direct broadcast satellite ( DBS ) products and services.  We cannot be certain that these persons do not own the rights they claim, that these rights are not valid or that our products and services do not infringe on these rights.  Further, we cannot be certain that we would be able to obtain licenses from these persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses, that we would be able to redesign our products and services to avoid infringement.  
    
  Separation Agreement 
    
  In 2008, DISH Network Corporation contributed its digital set-top box business and certain infrastructure and other assets, including certain of its satellites, uplink and satellite transmission assets, real estate, and other assets and related liabilities to EchoStar (the  Spin-off ).  In connection with the Spin-off, EchoStar entered into a separation agreement with DISH Network that provides, among other things, for the division of certain liabilities, including liabilities resulting from litigation.  Under the terms of the separation agreement, EchoStar has assumed certain liabilities that relate to its business, including certain designated liabilities for acts or omissions that occurred prior to the Spin-off.  Certain specific provisions govern intellectual property related claims under which, generally, EchoStar will only be liable for its acts or omissions following the Spin-off and DISH Network will indemnify EchoStar for any liabilities or damages resulting from intellectual property claims relating to the period prior to the Spin-off, as well as DISH Network s acts or omissions following the Spin-off. 
    
  Litigation  
    
  We are involved in a number of legal proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our business activities.  Many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages and/or seek an indeterminate amount of damages.  We regularly evaluate the status of the legal proceedings in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred and to determine if accruals are appropriate.  We record an accrual for litigation and other loss contingencies when we determine that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  If accruals are not appropriate, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of possible loss or range of loss can be made.  There can be no assurance that legal proceedings against us will be resolved in amounts that will not differ from the amounts of our recorded accruals.  Legal fees and other costs of defending litigation are charged to expense as incurred. 
    
  For certain cases described below, management is unable to predict with any degree of certainty the outcome or provide a meaningful estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss because, among other reasons, (i) the proceedings are in various stages; (ii) damages have not been sought or specified; (iii) damages are unsupported, indeterminate and/or exaggerated in management s opinion; (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and/or (vi) there are novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories to be presented or a large number of parties are involved (as with many patent-related cases).  For these cases, however, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flows, though there is no assurance that the resolution and outcomes of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to our financial condition, operating results or cash flows for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. 
    
  We intend to vigorously defend the proceedings against us.  In the event that a court ultimately rules against us, we may be subject to adverse consequences, including, without limitation, substantial damages, which may include treble damages, fines, penalties, compensatory damages and/or other equitable or injunctive relief that could require us to materially modify our business operations or certain products or services that we offer to our consumers.  In addition, adverse decisions against DISH Network in the proceedings described below could decrease the number of products and components we sell to DISH Network,

which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.     
    
  California Institute of Technology 
    
  On October 1, 2013, the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) filed suit against     two     of our subsidiaries, Hughes Communications, Inc. and Hughes Network Systems, LLC ( HNS ), as well as against DISH Network, DISH Network L.L.C., and dishNET Satellite Broadband L.L.C., in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 7,116,710; 7,421,032; 7,916,781; and 8,284,833, each of which is entitled  Serial Concatenation of Interleaved Convolutional Codes forming Turbo-Like Codes.   Caltech asserted that encoding data as specified by the DVB-S2 standard infringes each of the asserted patents.  In the operative Amended Complaint, served on March 6, 2014, Caltech claims that the Hopper   TM    set-top box that we design and sell to DISH Network, as well as certain of our Hughes segment s satellite broadband products and services, infringe the asserted patents by implementing the DVB-S2 standard.    On February 17, 2015, Caltech filed a second complaint in the same district against the same defendants alleging that HNS  Gen4 HT1000 and HT1100 products infringe the same patents asserted in the first case.  On May 25, 2016, we, the DISH Network defendants and Caltech entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the Court dismissed with prejudice all of the claims in these actions on May 31, 2016.   
    
  Elbit 
    
  On January 23, 2015, Elbit Systems Land and C4I LTD and Elbit Systems of America Ltd. (together referred to as  Elbit ) filed a complaint against our subsidiary HNS, as well as against Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations, LLC, Bluetide Communications, Inc. and Helm Hotels Group, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,240,073 (the  073 patent ) and 7,245,874 ( 874 patent ).  The 073 patent is entitled  Reverse Link for a Satellite Communication Network  and the 874 patent is entitled  Infrastructure for Telephony Network.   Elbit alleges that the 073 patent is infringed by broadband satellite systems that practice the Internet Protocol Over Satellite standard.  Elbit alleges that the 874 patent is infringed by the manufacture and sale of broadband satellite systems that provide cellular backhaul service via connections to E1 or T1 interfaces at cellular backhaul base stations.  On April 2, 2015, Elbit filed an amended complaint removing Helm Hotels Group as a defendant, but making similar allegations against a new defendant, Country Home Investments, Inc.  On November 3 and 4, 2015, and January 22, 2016, the defendants filed petitions before the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of the patents in suit, which the Patent and Trademark Office subsequently declined to institute.  On April 13, 2016, the defendants answered Elbit s complaint.  Trial is scheduled to commence on July 31, 2017.    
    
  Realtime Data LLC 
    
  On May 8, 2015, Realtime Data LLC ( Realtime ) filed suit against EchoStar Corporation and our subsidiary HNS in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 7,378,992, entitled  Content Independent Data Compression Method and System  7,415,530, entitled  System and Methods for Accelerated Data Storage and Retrieval  and 8,643,513, entitled  Data Compression System and Methods.   On September 14, 2015, Realtime amended its complaint, additionally alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 9,116,908, entitled  System and Methods for Accelerated Data Storage and Retrieval.   Realtime generally alleges that the asserted patents are infringed by certain HNS data compression products and services.  Over April 29, 2016 and May 5, 2016, the defendants filed petitions before the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of the asserted patents.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office has instituted proceedings on each of those petitions.  Realtime is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein.   
    
  TQ Beta LLC 
    
  On June 30, 2014, TQ Beta LLC ( TQ Beta ) filed suit against DISH Network, DISH DBS Corporation, DISH Network L.L.C., as well as HSS, EchoStar Corporation, EchoStar Technologies, L.L.C, and Sling Media, Inc., a subsidiary of EchoStar,   in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 7,203,456 (the  456 patent ), which is entitled  Method and Apparatus for Time and Space Domain Shifting of Broadcast Signals.   TQ Beta alleges that the Hopper, Hopper with Sling, ViP 722 and ViP 722k DVR devices, as well as the DISH Anywhere service and DISH Anywhere mobile application, infringe the 456 patent, but has not specified the amount of damages that it seeks.  TQ Beta is an entity that seeks to license an acquired patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein.

During August 2015, EchoStar Corporation and DISH Network L.L.C. filed petitions before the United States Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of certain claims of the 456 patent, and in February 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Office agreed to institute proceedings on our petitions.  On February 25, 2016, the case was stayed pending resolution of these proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and the Court vacated all pending court dates and deadlines.   
    
  Two-Way Media Ltd. 
    
  On February 17, 2016, Two-Way Media Ltd. ( TWM ) filed a complaint against EchoStar Corporation and   its   subsidiaries, EchoStar Technologies L.L.C., EchoStar Satellite Services L.L.C., and Sling Media, Inc., as well as against DISH Network Corporation, DISH DBS Corporation, DISH Network L.L.C., DISH Network Service L.L.C., Sling TV Holding L.L.C., Sling TV L.L.C., and Sling TV Purchasing L.L.C.  TWM brought the suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 5,778,187; 5,983,005; 6,434,622; and 7,266,686, each entitled  Multicasting Method and Apparatus  and 9,124,607, entitled  Methods and Systems for Playing Media.   TWM alleges that the Sling TV, Sling International, DISH Anywhere, and DISHWorld services, as well as the Slingbox units and DISH DVRs incorporating Slingbox technology, infringe the asserted patents.  TWM is an entity that seeks to license a patent portfolio without itself practicing any of the claims recited therein.   
    
  Other 
    
  In addition to the above actions, we are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of our business.  As part of our ongoing operations, the Company is subject to various inspections, audits, inquiries, investigations and similar actions by third parties, as well as by governmental/regulatory authorities responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations to which the Company may be subject.  Further, under the federal False Claims Act, private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or  whistleblower,  suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the federal government.  Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions.  In addition, the Company from time to time receives inquiries from federal, state and foreign agencies regarding compliance with various laws and regulations.    
    
  In our opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to any of these actions is unlikely to materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, though the resolutions and outcomes, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to our financial position, operating results or cash flows for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. 
    
  The Company indemnifies its directors, officers and employees for certain liabilities that might arise from the performance of their responsibilities for the Company.  Additionally, in the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts pursuant to which the Company may make a variety of representations and warranties and indemnify the counterparty for certain losses.  The Company s possible exposure under these arrangements cannot be reasonably estimated as this involves the resolution of claims made, or future claims that may be made, against the Company or its officers, directors or employees, the outcomes of which are unknown and not currently predictable or estimable. 

Note 13.                  Segment Reporting 
    
  Operating segments are business components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ), who for HSS, is the Company s Chief Executive Officer.  Under this definition, we operate in   two   primary business segments, Hughes and EchoStar Satellite Services as described in Note 1 of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The primary measure of segment profitability that is reported regularly to our CODM is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA.  Our segment operating results do not include real estate and other activities, costs incurred in certain satellite development programs and other business development activities, expenses of various corporate departments and our centralized treasury operations, including income from our investment portfolio and interest expense on our debt.  These activities are accounted for in the  All Other and Eliminations  column in the table below.  Total assets by segment have not been reported herein because the information is not provided to our CODM on a regular basis.  The Hughes Retail Group is included in our Hughes segment and our CODM reviews separate HRG financial information only to the extent

such information is included in our periodic filings with the SEC.  Therefore, we do not consider HRG to be a separate operating segment. 
    
  Transactions between segments were not significant for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .  
    
  The following table presents revenue, capital expenditures, and EBITDA for each of our operating segments:

Note 14.                  Related Party Transactions 
    
  EchoStar 
    
  We and EchoStar have agreed that we shall have the right, but not the obligation, to receive from EchoStar certain corporate services, including among other things: treasury, tax, accounting and reporting, risk management, legal, internal audit, human resources, and information technology.  These services are provided at cost.  We may terminate a particular service we receive from EchoStar for any reason upon at least   30 days    notice.  We recorded expenses for services received from EchoStar of   $5.2 million   and   $4.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $10.8 million   and   $12.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  In addition, we occupy certain office space in buildings owned or leased by EchoStar and pay a portion of the taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance of the premises in accordance with the percentage of the space we occupy. 
    
  We participate in certain of EchoStar s shared services arrangements for its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, including arrangements for payroll, accounts payable and cash management.  From time to time in connection with the processing of transactions under these arrangements, we may pay or receive amounts attributable to other domestic subsidiaries of EchoStar.  We report net payments on behalf of other subsidiaries in  Advances to affiliates, net  within current assets and we report net receipts on behalf of other subsidiaries in  Advances from affiliates, net  within current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  No repayment schedule for these net advances has been determined. 
    
  EchoStar and certain of its subsidiaries have provided cash advances to certain of our foreign subsidiaries to fund certain expenditures pursuant to loan agreements that mature in 2018 and 2022.  Advances under these agreements bear interest at annual rates ranging from   one   to   three   percent, subject to periodic adjustment based on the one-year U.S. LIBOR rate.  We report amounts payable under these agreements in  Advances from affiliates  within noncurrent liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  EchoStar XXI and EchoStar XXIII Launch Facilitation and Operational Control Agreement.    As part of applying for our launch licenses for EchoStar XXI and XXIII through the UK Space Agency, our subsidiary, Hughes Network Systems, Ltd. ( HNS Ltd. ) and a subsidiary of EchoStar, EchoStar Operating L.L.C. ( EOC ), entered into agreements in June 2015 and March 2016 to transfer to HNS Ltd., EOC s launch service contracts for the EchoStar XXI and EchoStar XXIII satellites, respectively, and to grant HNS Ltd. certain rights to control the in-orbit operations of these satellites.  EOC retained ownership of the satellites.  In March 2016, we recorded a   $70.3 million   addition to  Other noncurrent assets, net  and a corresponding increase in  Additional paid-in capital  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet to reflect EOC s cumulative payments under the EchoStar XXIII launch service contract prior to the transfer date.  EOC also contracted to make future payments to HNS Ltd. for amounts that HNS Ltd. is required to pay under both launch service contracts.  In March 2016, HNS Ltd. received   $11.9 million   in cash from EOC to fund a required payment under the EchoStar XXI launch service contract.  We recorded the cash receipt as an increase in  Additional paid-in capital.   HNS Ltd. s future payments under the launch service contracts are included in our disclosure of satellite-related obligations in Note 12. 
    
  DISH Network 
    
  Following the Spin-off, EchoStar and DISH Network have operated as separate publicly-traded companies.  However, pursuant to the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction, described in Note 3 and below,   DISH Network owns Hughes Retail Preferred Tracking Stock representing an aggregate   80.0%   economic interest in the residential retail satellite broadband business of our Hughes segment.  The tracking stock is an equity security and the rights of DISH Network, as the holder of the tracking stock, in our assets are subject to the claims of our creditors.  In addition, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of EchoStar and DISH Network is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, and by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. 
    
  In connection with and following the Spin-off, EchoStar and DISH Network have entered into certain agreements pursuant to which we and EchoStar obtain certain products, services and rights from DISH Network; DISH Network obtains certain products, services and rights from us and EchoStar; and we and DISH Network have indemnified each other against certain liabilities arising from our respective businesses.  We and/or EchoStar also may enter into additional agreements with DISH Network in the future.  Generally, the amounts DISH Network pays for products and services provided under the agreements are based on our cost plus a fixed margin (unless noted differently below or in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K), which varies depending on the nature of the products and services provided.

The following is a summary of the terms of our principal agreements with DISH Network that may have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
   Services and other revenue   DISH Network  
    
  Satellite Services Provided to DISH Network  .  Since the Spin-off, we have entered into certain satellite service agreements pursuant to which DISH Network receives satellite services on certain satellites owned or leased by us.  The fees for the services provided under these satellite service agreements depend, among other things, upon the orbital location of the applicable satellite, the number of transponders that are providing services on the applicable satellite, and the length of the service arrangements.  The terms of each service arrangement is set forth below: 
    
  EchoStar I, EchoStar VII, EchoStar X, EchoStar XI and EchoStar XIV.    As part of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction discussed in   Note 3  , in March 2014, we began providing certain satellite services to DISH Network on the EchoStar I, EchoStar VII, EchoStar X, EchoStar XI and EchoStar XIV satellites.  The term of each satellite services agreement generally terminates upon the earlier of:  (i) the end of life of the satellite; (ii) the date the satellite fails; or (iii) a certain date, which depends upon, among other things, the estimated useful life of the satellite.  DISH Network generally has the option to renew each satellite service agreement on a year-to-year basis through the end of the respective satellite s life.  There can be no assurance that any options to renew such agreements will be exercised.  DISH Network elected not to renew the satellite services agreement relative to the EchoStar I satellite.  The agreement for the EchoStar I satellite expired pursuant to its terms effective November 2015.  In December 2015, DISH Network renewed the satellite services agreement relative to the EchoStar VII satellite for     one   year to June 2017.  
    
  EchoStar VIII.    In May 2013, DISH Network began receiving satellite services from us on the EchoStar VIII satellite as an in-orbit spare.  Effective March 2014, this satellite services arrangement converted to a month-to-month service agreement with both parties having the right to terminate upon     30 days    notice.    The agreement terminated in accordance with its terms effective November 2015. 
    
  EchoStar IX  .  Effective January 2008, DISH Network began receiving satellite services from us on the EchoStar IX satellite.  Subject to availability, DISH Network generally has the right to continue to receive satellite services from us on the EchoStar IX satellite on a month-to-month basis. 
    
  EchoStar XII  .  DISH Network receives satellite services from us on the EchoStar XII satellite.  The term of the satellite services agreement terminates upon the earlier of: (i) the end of life of the satellite; (ii) the date the satellite fails or the date the transponder(s) on which the service was being provided under the agreement fails; or (iii) September 2017.  DISH Network generally has the option to renew the agreement on a year-to-year basis through the end of the satellite s life.  There can be no assurance that any options to renew this agreement will be exercised. 
    
  EchoStar XVI.      In December 2009, we entered into an initial     ten  -year   transponder service agreement with DISH Network, pursuant to which DISH Network has received satellite services from us on the EchoStar XVI satellite since January 2013.  Effective December 2012, we and DISH Network amended the transponder service agreement to, among other things, change the initial term to generally expire upon the earlier of: (i) the end-of-life or replacement of the satellite; (ii) the date the satellite fails; (iii) the date the transponder(s) on which service is being provided under the agreement fails; or (iv)     four years   following the actual service commencement date.  In July 2016, we and DISH Network further amended the transponder service agreement to, among other things, extend the initial term by   one   additional year and to reduce the term of the first renewal option by   one   year.  Prior to expiration of the initial term, we, upon certain conditions, and DISH Network have the option to renew for an additional   five  -year period.    If either we or DISH Network exercise our respective     five  -year   renewal options, DISH Network has the option to renew for an additional     five  -year period   prior to expiration of the then-current term.  There can be no assurance that any option to renew this agreement will be exercised.  In the event that we or DISH Network does not exercise the first     five  -year   renewal option or DISH Network does not exercise the second   five  -year   renewal option, DISH Network has the option to purchase the EchoStar XVI satellite for a certain price.  If DISH Network does not elect to purchase the EchoStar XVI satellite at that time, we may sell the EchoStar XVI satellite to a third party and DISH Network is required to pay us a certain amount in the event we are not able to sell the EchoStar XVI satellite for more than a certain amount.

  Other agreements   DISH Network 
    
  Tax Sharing Agreement.    As a subsidiary of EchoStar, we are an indirect party to EchoStar s tax sharing agreement with DISH Network that was entered into in connection with the Spin-off.  This agreement governs EchoStar and DISH Network s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the Spin-off with respect to taxes for the periods ending on or before the Spin-off.  Generally, all pre-Spin-off taxes, including any taxes that are incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken to implement the Spin-off, are borne by DISH Network, and DISH Network will indemnify EchoStar for such taxes.  However, DISH Network is not liable for and will not indemnify EchoStar for any taxes that are incurred as a result of the Spin-off or certain related transactions failing to qualify as tax-free distributions pursuant to any provision of Section 355 or Section 361 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended because of: (i) a direct or indirect acquisition of any of EchoStar s stock, stock options or assets; (ii) any action that EchoStar takes or fails to take; or (iii) any action that EchoStar takes that is inconsistent with the information and representations furnished to the IRS in connection with the request for the private letter ruling, or to counsel in connection with any opinion being delivered by counsel with respect to the Spin-off or certain related transactions.  In such case, EchoStar will be solely liable for, and will indemnify DISH Network for, any resulting taxes, as well as any losses, claims and expenses.  The tax sharing agreement will only terminate after the later of the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations, including extensions, or once all rights and obligations are fully effectuated or performed.

  Other Agreements 
    
  Hughes Systique Corporation ( Hughes Systique ) 
    
  We contract with Hughes Systique for software development services.  In 2008, Hughes Communications loaned $  1.5 million   to Hughes Systique pursuant to a term loan facility.  The initial interest rate on the loans was   6%  , payable annually, and the accrued and unpaid interest was added to the principal amount in certain circumstances.  The loans were convertible into shares of Hughes Systique upon non-payment or an event of default.  In May 2014, we amended the term loan facility to increase the interest rate from   6%   to   8%  , payable annually, to reflect then-current market conditions and extend the maturity date of the loans to May 1, 2015, and in April 2015, we extended the maturity date of the loans to May 1, 2016 on the same terms.  In 2015, Hughes Systique repaid   $1.5 million   of the outstanding principal of the loan facility.  In February 2016, Hughes Systique repaid   $0.3 million   of the outstanding principal of the loan facility.  In April 2016, Hughes Systique repaid in full the remaining $  0.3 million   outstanding principal and interest of the loan facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the principal amount outstanding of the loan facility was   zero  .  In addition to our   43.9%   ownership in Hughes Systique, Mr. Pradman Kaul, the President of Hughes Communications and a member of EchoStar s board of directors, and his brother, who is the CEO and President of Hughes Systique, in the aggregate, own approximately   25.8%  , on an undiluted basis, of Hughes Systique s outstanding shares as of   September 30, 2016  .  Furthermore, Mr. Pradman Kaul serves on the board of directors of Hughes Systique.  Hughes Systique is a variable interest entity and we are considered the primary beneficiary of Hughes Systique due to, among other factors, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hughes Systique.  As a result, we consolidate Hughes Systique s financial statements in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
     
  Dish Mexico 
    
  EchoStar owns   49.0%   of an entity that provides direct-to-home satellite services in Mexico known as Dish Mexico, and we provide certain satellite services to Dish Mexico.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
    
  We are a holding company and a subsidiary of EchoStar Corporation ( EchoStar ).  We were formed as a Colorado corporation in March 2011.  We are a global provider of satellite service operations, video delivery solutions, broadband satellite technologies and broadband services for home and office customers.  We deliver innovative network technologies, managed services, and various communications solutions for enterprise and government customers.  We currently operate in two business segments, which are differentiated primarily by their operational focus:  Hughes and EchoStar Satellite Services ( ESS ).  These segments are consistent with the way decisions regarding the allocation of resources are made, as well as how operating results are reviewed by our chief operating decision maker ( CODM ), who for HSS, is the Company s Chief Executive Officer. 
    
  Highlights from our financial results are as follows: 
    
  Consolidated Results of Operations   for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 

Net income attributable to HSS of   $99.2 million 
                
    EBITDA of   $586.1 million   see reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure on page 42) 
       
  Consolidated Financial Condition as of   September 30, 2016    

Total shareholders  equity of   $1.74 billion    
                
    Cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities of   $2.22 billion    

Hughes Segment 
    
  Our Hughes segment is a global provider of broadband satellite technologies and broadband services for home and office customers.  We deliver network technologies, managed services and communications solutions for domestic and international consumer, enterprise and government customers. 
    
  We continue to focus our efforts on growing our Hughes segment consumer revenue by maximizing utilization of our existing satellites while planning for new satellites to be launched.  Our consumer revenue growth depends on our success in adding new subscribers and driving higher average revenue per subscriber across our wholesale and retail channels.     
    
  We have been preparing for the launch of the EchoStar XIX satellite, a next-generation, high throughput geostationary satellite, which will provide significant capacity for continued subscriber growth.  In March 2013,   a subsidiary of EchoStar   entered into a contract for the design and construction of the EchoStar XIX satellite, which is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The EchoStar XIX satellite will employ a multi-spot beam, bent pipe Ka-band architecture and will provide additional capacity for the Hughes broadband services in North America and certain Latin American countries.    Capital expenditures

associated with the construction and launch of the EchoStar XIX satellite have been incurred by our parent company, EchoStar, which intends to contribute the satellite to us after the launch of the satellite. 
    
  In addition to our broadband consumer service offerings, our Hughes segment also provides managed services, hardware, and satellite services to large enterprise and government customers globally.  Examples of such customers include lottery agencies, gas station operators and companies with multi-branch networks that rely on satellite or terrestrial networks for critical communication across wide geographies.  Most of our enterprise customers have contracts with us for the services they purchase.   
    
  Our Hughes segment also designs, provides and installs gateway and terminal equipment to customers for other satellite systems.  Developments toward the launch of next-generation satellite systems including low-earth orbit ( LEO ) and geostationary systems could provide additional opportunities to drive the demand for our network equipment and services.  The growth of our enterprise and equipment businesses relies heavily on global economic conditions and the competitive landscape for pricing relative to competitors and alternative technologies.     
    
  We continue our efforts to grow our consumer satellite services business outside of the U.S.  In April 2014, we entered into a satellite services agreement pursuant to which Eutelsat do Brasil provides us Ka-band capacity into Brazil on the EUTELSAT 65 West A satellite for a 15-year term.  That satellite was launched in March 2016 and we began delivering high-speed consumer satellite broadband services in Brazil in July 2016.  In September 2015, we entered into satellite services agreements pursuant to which affiliates of Telesat Canada will provide to us, the Ka-band capacity on a satellite to be located at the 63 degree west longitude orbital location for a 15-year term.  We expect the satellite to be launched in the second quarter of 2018 and plan to enter into service in additional markets across South America once that capacity is available for commercial use. 
    
  We are tracking closely the developments in next-generation satellite businesses, and we are seeking to utilize our services, technologies and expertise to find new commercial opportunities for our business.  In June 2015,   EchoStar made,   an equity investment in WorldVu Satellites Limited ( OneWeb ), a global LEO satellite service company   and we   entered into an agreement with OneWeb to provide certain equipment and services in connection with the ground systems for OneWeb s LEO satellites.  Our Hughes segment also has the right of first refusal to 50% of the OneWeb capacity in the United States, Europe, Brazil and India for offering latency sensitive services to our Hughes segment s customer base.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our Hughes segment had approximately   1,018,000   and 1,035,000 broadband subscribers, respectively.    These broadband subscribers include customers that subscribe to our HughesNet broadband services through retail, wholesale and small/medium enterprise service channels.  Gross subscriber additions decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the second quarter of 2016 primarily due to a decrease in additions in our wholesale channel     due to satellite beams servicing certain areas reaching capacity.    Our average monthly subscriber churn percentage for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased as compared to the second quarter of 2016.    As a result of lower gross subscriber additions and an increase in churn, net subscribers for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased by approximately 12,000 when compared to the second quarter of 2016 with decreases in both wholesale and retail subscribers  .    Subscriber additions and churn include only subscribers through our retail and wholesale channels. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   our Hughes segment had approximately   $1.46 billion   an  d $1.44 billion, respectively, of contracted revenue backlog.  We define Hughes contracted revenue backlog as our expected future revenue under customer contracts that are non-cancelable, excluding agreements with customers in our consumer market. 

EchoStar Satellite Services Segment 
    
  Our ESS segment is a global provider of satellite service operations and video delivery solutions.  We operate our business using our owned and leased in-orbit satellites.  We provide satellite services on a full-time and occasional-use basis primarily to DISH Network Corporation and its subsidiaries ( DISH Network ) (our largest customer), Dish Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. ( Dish Mexico ) (a joint venture of our parent company, EchoStar), U.S. government service providers, internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, programmers and private enterprise customers. 
    
  We depend on DISH Network for a significant portion of the revenue for our ESS segment, and we expect that DISH Network will continue to be the primary source of revenue for our ESS segment.  Therefore, the results of operations of our ESS segment are linked to changes in DISH Network s satellite capacity requirements.  DISH Network s capacity requirements have been driven by the addition of new channels and migration of programming to high-definition TV and video on demand services.  The services that we provide to DISH Network are critical to its nationwide delivery of content to its customers across the U.S.

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued 

In August 2014, we entered into: (i) a construction contract with Airbus Defence and Space SAS for the construction of the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite with C-band, Ku-band and Ka-band payloads; (ii) an agreement with SES Satellite Leasing Limited for the procurement of the related launch services; and (iii) an agreement with SES Americom Inc. ( SES ) pursuant to which we will transfer the title to the C-band and Ka-band payloads to SES Satellite Leasing Limited at launch and transfer the title to the Ku-band payload to SES following in-orbit testing of the satellite.  Simultaneously, SES will provide to us satellite service on the entire Ku-band payload on the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite for an initial ten-year term, with an option for us to renew the agreement on a year-to-year basis.  Due to anomalies experienced by our launch provider, the expected launch date of the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite has been delayed.  We currently expect to launch the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite in the first half of 2017.  Our Ku-band payload on the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite will replace and augment our current capacity on the AMC-15 satellite.  As a result of this launch delay, we expect to incur additional costs related to the lease of the AMC-15 satellite.  
    
  Revenue growth in our ESS segment depends largely on our ability to continuously make additional satellite capacity available for sale.  Once the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite is launched and placed into operation, we expect periodic revenue from the satellite to exceed the amount currently generated by the AMC-15 satellite.  As a result of the launch delay, we expect a delay in revenue generated from the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite.   
    
  We continue to pursue expanding our business offerings by providing value added services such as telemetry, tracking, and control services to third parties, which leverages the ground monitoring networks and personnel currently within our business.    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   our ESS segment had contracted revenue backlog attributable to satellites currently in orbit of approximately $1.21 billion and $1.41 billion, respectively. 
    
  New Business Opportunities  
    
  Our industry is evolving with the increase in worldwide demand for broadband internet access for information, entertainment and commerce.  In addition to fiber and wireless systems, other technologies such as geostationary high throughput satellites, LEO orbit networks, balloons, and High Altitude Platform Systems will likely play significant roles in enabling global broadband access, networks and services.  We intend to use our expertise, technologies, capital, investments, global presence, relationships and other capabilities to continue to provide broadband internet systems, networks and services for information, entertainment and commerce in North America and internationally for consumers, enterprises and governments. 
    
  We are selectively exploring opportunities to pursue partnerships, joint ventures and strategic acquisition opportunities, domestically and internationally, that we believe may allow us to increase our existing market share, expand into new markets, broaden our portfolio of products and intellectual property, and strengthen our relationships with our customers.  We may allocate significant resources for long-term initiatives that may not have a short or medium-term or any positive impact on our revenue, results of operations, or cash flow.

Item 1A.      RISK FACTORS 
    
  Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  of our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors.  Except as provided below, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes in our risk factors as previously disclosed. 
    
  GENERAL RISKS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS 
    
  The failure to adequately anticipate the need for satellite capacity or the inability to obtain satellite capacity for our Hughes segment could harm our results of operations. 
    
  Our Hughes segment has made substantial contractual commitments for satellite capacity based on our existing customer contracts and backlog.  If our existing customer contracts were to be terminated prior to their respective expiration dates, we may be committed to maintaining excess satellite capacity for which we will have insufficient revenue to cover our costs, which would have a negative impact on our margins and results of operations.  Alternatively, we may not have sufficient satellite capacity to meet demand.  We have satellite capacity commitments, generally for two to five year terms, with third parties to cover different geographical areas or support different applications and features; therefore, we may not be able to quickly or easily adjust our capacity to changes in demand.  We generally only purchase satellite capacity based on existing contracts and bookings.  Therefore, capacity for certain types of coverage in the future may not be readily available to us, and we may not be able to satisfy certain needs of our customers, which could result in a loss of possible new business and could negatively impact the margins for those services.  At present, until the launch and operation of additional satellites, there is limited availability of capacity on the frequencies we use in North America, including within our own fleet of satellites.  Our ability to provide additional capacity for subscriber growth in our North American consumer market could also be adversely affected by regulations in the U.S. recently adopted by the FCC.  The FCC has enabled the use of a portion of the frequency bands, including without limitation, the Ka-band, where we operate our broadband gateway earth stations, for 5G mobile terrestrial services.  In addition, the FSS industry has seen consolidation in the past decade, and today, the main FSS providers in North America and a number of smaller regional providers own and operate the current satellites that are available for our capacity needs.  The failure of any of these FSS providers to replace existing satellite assets at the end of their useful lives or a downturn in their industry as a whole could reduce or interrupt the satellite capacity available to us.  If we are not able to renew our capacity leases at economically viable rates, or if capacity is not available due to problems experienced by these FSS providers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  
    
  We may not be able to generate cash to meet our debt service needs or fund our operations.    
  As of September 30, 2016, our total indebtedness was approximately   $3.66 billion  .    Our ability to make payments on or to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject in part to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  We may need to raise additional debt in order to fund ongoing operations or to capitalize on business opportunities.  We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our operations or other liquidity needs.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash, we may be forced to take actions such as revising or delaying our strategic plans, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital.  We may not be able to implement any of these actions on satisfactory terms, or at all.  The indentures governing the 2019 Senior Secured Notes, the 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes and the 2026 Notes limit our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions.  Therefore, we may not be able to consummate those dispositions on satisfactory terms, or at all, or to use those proceeds in a manner we may otherwise prefer. 
  In addition, conditions in the financial markets could make it difficult for us to access capital markets at acceptable terms or at all.  Instability or other conditions in the equity markets could make it difficult for us to raise equity financing without incurring substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.  In addition, sustained or increased economic weaknesses or pressures or new economic conditions may limit our ability to generate sufficient internal cash to fund investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other strategic transactions.  We cannot predict with any certainty whether or not we will be impacted by economic conditions.   
  
   48 

     Table of Contents  

As a result, these conditions make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities because we may not have access to funding sources necessary for us to pursue organic and strategic business development opportunities.    
  Covenants in our indentures restrict our business in many ways.    
  The indentures governing the 2019 Senior Secured Notes, the 2021 Senior Unsecured Notes, and the 2026  Notes contain various covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries  ability to, among other things:    
             
    incur additional debt;     
                
    pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;  
                
    make certain investments;    
                
    create liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;    
                
    enter into transactions with affiliates;     
                
    merge or consolidate with another company;    
                
    transfer and sell assets; and    
                
    allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, make distributions, make other payments, or transfer assets to us or our subsidiaries.  
       
  Failure to comply with these and certain other financial covenants, if not cured or waived, may result in an event of default under the indentures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.  If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the respective indenture, the trustee under that indenture or the requisite holders of the notes under that indenture may declare all such notes to be immediately due and payable and, in the case of the indentures governing any of our secured notes, could proceed against the collateral that secures the applicable secured notes.  We and certain of our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral to secure the 2019 Senior Secured Notes and the 2026 Senior Secured Notes.  If we do not have enough cash to service our debt or fund other liquidity needs, we may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from the holders of the notes, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital.  We cannot assure you that any of these remedies can be implemented on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could result in the trustee declaring the notes to be immediately due and payable and/or foreclosing on the collateral.    
  We may be subject to risks relating to the referendum of the United Kingdom s membership of the European Union. 
    
  In June 2016, the United Kingdom (the  U.K. ) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as the  Brexit.   As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the U.K. government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s future relationship with the EU.  Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and EU countries.  Additionally, with the U.K. no longer being a part of the EU, we anticipate that there may be certain regulatory changes that may impact the regulatory regime under which we operate in both the U.K. and the EU.  These and other changes, implications and consequences of the Brexit may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
    
  RISKS RELATED TO OUR SATELLITES 
    
  Our satellites under construction are subject to risks related to construction and launch that could limit our ability to utilize these satellites. 
    
  Satellite construction and launch are subject to significant risks, including delays, anomalies, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement.  Certain launch vehicles that may be used by us have either unproven track records or have experienced launch failures in the past.  The risks of launch delay, launch anomalies and launch failure are usually greater when the launch vehicle does not have a track record of previous successful flights.  Launch anomalies and failures can result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites, which can take more than three years, and to obtain other launch opportunities.  Such significant delays could materially and adversely affect our business, expenses and results of operations, our ability to meet regulatory or contractual required milestones, the availability and our use of other or replacement satellite resources and our ability to provide services to customers as capacity becomes full on existing satellites.  In addition, significant delays in a satellite program could give customers who have purchased or reserved capacity on that satellite a right to terminate their service contracts relating to the satellite.  We may not be able to accommodate affected customers on other satellites until a replacement satellite is available.  A customer s termination of its  
  
   49 

     Table of Contents  

service contracts with us as a result of a launch delay or failure would reduce our contracted backlog and our ability to generate revenue.  One of our launch services providers is a Russian Federation state-owned company.  Recent ongoing political events, including the imposition of sanctions, have created uncertainty as to the stability of U.S. and Russian Federation relations.  This could add to risks relative to scheduling uncertainties and timing.  Historically, we have not always carried launch insurance for the launch of our satellites.  If a launch delay, anomaly or failure were to occur, it could result in the revocation of the applicable license to operate the satellite, undermine our ability to implement our business strategy or develop or pursue existing or future business opportunities with applicable licenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, expenses, assets, revenue, results of operations and ability to fund future satellite procurement and launch opportunities.  In addition, the occurrence of launch anomalies and failures, whether on our satellites or those of others, may significantly reduce our ability to place launch insurance for our satellites or make launch insurance uneconomical. 
    
  RISKS RELATED TO THE REGULATION OF OUR BUSINESS 
    
  Our business is subject to risks of adverse government regulation.    
    
  Our business is subject to varying degrees of regulation in the U.S. by the FCC, and other federal, state and local entities, and in foreign countries by similar entities and internationally by the International Telecommunications Union.  These regulations are subject to the administrative and political process and do change, for political and other reasons, from time to time.  For example, the FCC recently adopted an order in its  Spectrum Frontiers  proceeding under which a portion of the Ka-band, in which we operate our broadband gateway earth stations, has been enabled for 5G mobile terrestrial services.  Other countries in which we currently, or may in the future, operate are also considering regulations that could limit access to the Ka band.  Additionally, the FCC is considering adopting a regulatory regime whereby consumer electronics manufacturers, innovators, and other developers would be able to build devices or software solutions that may provide access to multichannel video programming with the use of user interfaces and without the use of any set-top box.  If adopted, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.  Moreover, a substantial number of foreign countries in which we have, or may in the future make, an investment, regulate, in varying degrees, the ownership of satellites and other telecommunication facilities/networks and foreign investment in telecommunications companies.  Violations of laws or regulations may result in various sanctions including fines, loss of authorizations and the denial of applications for new authorizations or for the renewal of existing authorizations.  Further material changes in law and regulatory requirements may also occur, and there can be no assurance that our business and the business of our subsidiaries and affiliates will not be adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.  The failure to obtain or comply with the authorizations and regulations governing our operations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and our overall competitive position and could result in our suffering serious harm to our reputation.

  Unaudited Condensed Attributed Financial Information for Hughes Retail Group 
    
  On March 1, 2014, EchoStar Corporation   ( EchoStar )   issued shares of its newly authorized Hughes Retail Preferred Tracking Stock (the  EchoStar Tracking Stock ) and Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation ( HSS ), a subsidiary of EchoStar, also issued shares of its newly authorized Hughes Retail Preferred Tracking Stock (the  HSS Tracking Stock  and together with the EchoStar Tracking Stock, the  Tracking Stock ) to certain subsidiaries of DISH Network Corporation.    
    
  The Tracking Stock is intended to reflect the separate performance of the Hughes Retail Group, which is comprised primarily of our business of providing satellite broadband internet services to residential retail subscribers, including the assets and liabilities primarily associated with the operation of the business; and the business operations, revenue, billings, operating and other direct and indirect support activities to provide services to the business and Hughes retail subscribers.  The Hughes Retail Group also includes any proceeds associated with a sale or transfer of the Hughes Retail Group or any assets of the Hughes Retail Group, and any other assets acquired by or for the account of the Hughes Retail Group or otherwise attributed, contributed, allocated or transferred to the Hughes Retail Group from time to time.  The   HSSC   Group is comprised of all existing and future businesses of   Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation   and its subsidiaries, excluding the Hughes Retail Group.    
    
  Holders of the Tracking Stock     are holders of capital stock of the issuer (EchoStar or HSS) and are subject to risks associated with an investment in the issuer and all of its businesses, assets and liabilities.  The issuance of the Tracking Stock does not affect the rights of our creditors or the creditors of our subsidiaries.     
    
  Notwithstanding the following attribution of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows to the Hughes Retail Group and the   HSSC   Group, our tracking stock structure does not affect the ownership of or the legal title to our assets or responsibility for our liabilities.    
    
  The accompanying condensed attributed financial information as of, and for, the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the year ended   December 31, 2015   are unaudited.    The Company s management is solely responsible for this financial information and believes that it has been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

  Note 1.             Business Description 
    
  The Hughes Retail Group is generally comprised of our business of providing satellite broadband internet services to residential retail subscribers in the United States, including the assets and liabilities primarily associated with the operation of the business; and the business operations, revenue, billings, operating and other direct and indirect support activities to provide services to the business and Hughes retail subscribers.  The Hughes Retail Group also includes any proceeds associated with a sale or transfer of the Hughes Retail Group or any assets of the Hughes Retail Group, and any other assets acquired by or for the account of the Hughes Retail Group or otherwise attributed, contributed, allocated or transferred to the Hughes Retail Group from time to time.    The HSSC   Group consists of all other operations of   HSS,   including all existing and future businesses other than the Hughes Retail Group.    HSS   has adopted a policy statement (the  Policy Statement ) as described in Note 2 below, which sets forth management and allocation policies for purposes of attributing all of the business and operations of   HSS   to either the Hughes Retail Group or the   HSSC   Group (each as fully defined in the Policy Statement and collectively, the  Groups ).    

Note 2.             Basis of Presentation 
    
  The overall objective of the attributed financial information is to present   HSS  attributed   amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements     to the Hughes Retail Group and the   HSSC   Group.  The Policy Statement contains specific provisions that determine how certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses are attributed to the Groups.  The Policy Statement does not explicitly address the attribution of all amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements; accordingly, management applies judgment in attributing certain amounts based on its assessment of the activities of the Groups and the guiding principles set forth in the Policy Statement.     
    
  Set forth below is an overview of the Policy Statement and additional discussion about how we have attributed amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements to the Groups.    
    
  Policy Statement 
    
  In accordance with the Policy Statement, all existing and future retail subscribers in the United States, including related customer contracts, are attributed to the Hughes Retail Group.  Assets and liabilities that are directly related to the Hughes Retail Group are attributed to the Hughes Retail Group, including certain accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, deferred subscriber acquisition costs, intangible assets and tax related assets and liabilities.  To the extent practicable, costs and expenses are attributed without markup to the Hughes Retail Group or the   HSSC   Group based on specific identification.  Common or shared costs, including corporate overhead, are allocated between the Hughes Retail Group and the   HSSC   Group using objective methods and criteria that reflect the relative usage of the corresponding functions or services.  Where resources are shared by the Groups and determinations based on use alone are not practicable, we use other methods and criteria that we believe are fair and result in a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with operation, utilization, and maintenance of such resources to each Group.  Such methods and criteria may include allocations based on revenue, operating costs, square footage, headcount or management estimates.  Under the documents governing the Tracking Stock, any change in our management s allocation methodologies requires the consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Tracking Stock, but does not require the consent of our common   shareholders. 
    
  The Hughes Retail Group utilizes broadband satellite capacity that is operated and maintained by the   HSSC   Group.  The Policy Statement provides for a monthly charge to the Hughes Retail Group for its utilization of such capacity based on the number of retail subscribers and revenue per month.  In addition, the Policy Statement establishes pricing for the Hughes Retail Group purchases of customer rental equipment from the   HSSC   Group based on cost plus a fixed margin percentage.  Income taxes incurred by   HSS   and its subsidiaries that include operations of the Hughes Retail Group are allocated between the   HSSC   Group and the Hughes Retail Group based primarily on the relative amounts of earnings or loss attributable to each Group.    
    
  The various attributions, allocations and inter-group charges provided for in the Policy Statement generally do not affect the amounts reported in   HSS    condensed consolidated financial statements, except for effects on the attribution of equity and net income or loss between the holders of Tracking Stock and   HSS  common shareholders.    The Policy Statement also does not significantly affect the way that the Hughes segment management assesses operating performance and allocates resources.  In addition, our chief operating decision maker reviews the Hughes Retail Group financial information only to the extent such information is included in our periodic filings with the SEC.  Therefore we do not consider the Hughes Retail Group to be a separate operating segment.

    NOTES TO CONDENSED ATTRIBUTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
  (Unaudited) 

Balance Sheet Attributions 
    
  Assets attributed to the Hughes Retail Group based on specific identification consist primarily of trade accounts receivable from retail broadband subscribers, property and equipment (primarily customer rental equipment) used solely in the retail business, and deferred subscriber acquisition costs included in other noncurrent assets.  Goodwill and other intangible assets (primarily customer relationships, developed technology and trademarks), which were recognized in connection with our acquisition of Hughes Communications, Inc. in June 2011, were attributed to the Hughes Retail Group based on an analysis of information for the retail business that was available at the acquisition date.    
    
  No attribution to the Hughes Retail Group has been made for certain significant assets that it shares with the   HSSC   Group, including regulatory authorizations and property and equipment (such as satellites and related terrestrial facilities), because those assets are operated and maintained by the   HSSC   Group and it is not practicable to allocate the asset carrying amounts between the Groups.  However, the Hughes Retail Group has the right to use such assets and is charged for its use of such assets in accordance with the Policy Statement.    
    
  Liabilities attributed to the Hughes Retail Group based on specific identification consist primarily of customer prepayments and deferred revenue related to retail subscribers and deferred tax liabilities related to assets and liabilities that have been attributed to the Hughes Retail Group.  Except to a limited extent, it is not practicable to attribute accounts payable and accrued liabilities to the Hughes Retail Group because those amounts arise from centralized processes managed by the   HSSC   Group.  The Hughes Retail Group generally incurs inter-group payables to all other operations in connection with such centralized processes.  As provided in the Policy Statement, none of our long-term debt is attributed to the Hughes Retail Group; however, interest is charged on all inter-group payables.    
    
  Revenue and Expense Attributions 
    
  The Hughes Retail Group revenue relates to services and equipment provided to retail broadband subscribers and is readily identifiable based on specific identification.    
    
  Expenses attributed to the Hughes Retail Group based on specific identification include depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets that are attributed to the Hughes Retail Group.  Certain other operating expenses, such as compensation of employees that work exclusively in the retail business, are also attributed to the Hughes Retail Group based on specific identification.  A substantial portion of the Hughes Retail Group cost of sales is based on the specific inter-group pricing provisions of the Policy Statement, including a monthly charge per retail subscriber and charges for customer rental equipment at cost plus a fixed margin percentage.  The Hughes Retail Group operating expenses also reflect allocations of corporate overhead and other expenses incurred by   HSS. 
    
  Cash Flow Attributions 
    
  The Hughes Retail Group participates in   HSS    centralized cash management system and does not maintain separate cash accounts.  Under the centralized cash management system, net advances of cash to or from the Hughes Retail Group are reflected in an inter-group receivable or payable account, which bears interest at the same rate earned by   HSS   on its cash and marketable investment securities portfolio.  There is no allocation of   HSS    long-term debt or related interest costs to the Hughes Retail Group.    
    
  Cash receipts from retail broadband subscribers and payments of certain expenses attributed to the Hughes Retail Group on a specific identification basis generally are reflected in the attributed statements of cash flows in the period the cash is received or paid.  It is not practicable to determine the timing of related cash disbursements under the centralized cash management system for other costs and expenses attributed to the Hughes Retail Group.  The accompanying statements of cash flows generally presents cash flows related to such transactions when they are recognized on an accrual basis in an inter-group receivable or payable account.  Periodic changes in inter-group receivables or payables generally are indicative of amounts received or paid by the   HSSC   Group on behalf of the Hughes Retail Group and are reported in the accompanying attributed statements of cash flows as investing activity for the Group with a net receivable balance or as financing activity for the Group with a net payable balance.

Note 3.             Property and Equipment 
    
  Property and equipment for the Hughes Retail Group consisted of the following:    

Depreciation expense associated with the Hughes Retail Group property and equipment, net of retirements, was $29.1 million and $30.5 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $87.8 million and $89.8 million for the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

Note 4.             Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill is assigned to reporting units of our operating segments.  A portion of the Hughes segment goodwill was attributed to the Hughes Retail Group as if the Hughes Retail Group had been a separate reporting unit at June 8, 2011, the date EchoStar completed the acquisition of Hughes Communications, Inc.  Approximately $260.0 million of the $504.2 million Hughes segment goodwill was attributed to the Hughes Retail Group.    
    
  Other Intangible Assets 
    
  Other intangible assets for the Hughes Retail Group consisted of the following:    

Customer relationships are amortized predominantly in relation to the expected contribution of cash flow to the business over the life of the intangible asset.  Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods the assets are expected to contribute to our cash flows.  Amortization expense was $4.1 million and $4.9 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and $12.1 million and $14.7 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   

Note 5.             Income Taxes 
    
  We establish a provision for income taxes currently payable or receivable and for income tax amounts deferred to future periods based upon a separate return allocation method which results in income tax expense that approximates the expense that would result if the Hughes Retail Group was a stand-alone entity.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of differences that exist between the financial reporting carrying amount and tax bases of assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances when we determine it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future.

Note 6.             Equity/ Attributed Net Assets 
    
  The reported amounts of equity/attributed net assets for the Hughes Retail Group and the HSSC Group represent the excess of attributed assets over attributed liabilities for the respective Groups.  The HSSC Group equity reflects EchoStar s aggregate   71.89%   economic interest in the net assets of the Hughes Retail Group, which comprises DISH Network s   51.89%   economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group represented by EchoStar Tracking Stock and EchoStar s   20.0%   retained interest in the Hughes Retail Group. 
    
  The Hughes Retail Group equity/attributed net assets consisted of attributed paid-in capital and accumulated earnings as follows:
