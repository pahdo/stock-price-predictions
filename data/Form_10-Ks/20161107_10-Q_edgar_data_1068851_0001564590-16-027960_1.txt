     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
 (UNAUDITED) 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Prosperity Bancshares, Inc.    ( Bancshares ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Prosperity Bank    (the  Bank,  collectively referred to as the  Company ). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for financial information and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company on a consolidated basis, and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or any other period. 

2. INCOME PER COMMON SHARE 
 Outstanding stock options issued by the Company represent the only dilutive effect reflected in diluted weighted average shares.  The following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

There were no stock options exercisable during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015 that would have had an anti-dilutive effect on the above computation. 

3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU ) 
 ASU 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   ASU 2016-15 addresses certain cash receipts and cash payments with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.  
 ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. Additionally, available for sale debt securities may realize value either through collection of contractual cash flows or through sale of the security at fair value. Therefore, the amendments limit the amount of the allowance for credit losses to the difference between amortized cost and fair value. ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on the Company s financial statements.

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
 (UNAUDITED) 
   
  ASU 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.    ASU 2016-12 addresses narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collec  tability, noncash consideration   and completed contracts at transition. Additio  nally, the amendments in this update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. The amendments in thi  s update affect the guidance in   ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ,      which is effective January   1, 2018. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance and does not currently anticipate a significant im  pact on the   Company s   financial statements.  
 ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.   ASU 2016-10 clarifies two aspects of   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)     (i) identifying performance obligations and (ii) the licensing implementation guidance. This ASU adds guidance on how to identify the promised goods or services in the contract and how to evaluate whether promised goods and services are distinct. Additionally, this update includes guidance on determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time) and when to recognize revenue for a sales-based or use-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in  ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ,  which is effective January 1, 2018. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance and does not currently anticipate a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  
 ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   ASU 2016-09 was issued as part of the FASB s simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. This ASU covers accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company as of January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-09 on the Company s financial statements.      
 ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).   ASU 2016-08 states that when another party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer, an entity is required to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide the specified good or service itself (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for that good or service to be provided by the other party (that is, the entity is an agent). Additionally, when an principal entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred to the customer, but when an agent entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity recognizes revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified good or service to be provided by the other party. The amendments in this update affect the guidance in  ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ,  which is effective January 1, 2018. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance and does not currently anticipate a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  
 ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)."  ASU 2016-02 requires that lessees and lessors recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning January 1, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statements.  
 ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10)   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 (i) requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (ii) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (iii) eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities; (iv) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (v) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (vi) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (vii) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet

  or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (viii) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a   deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. The amendments in this update affect all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for   the Company beginning January 1, 2018, and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  
 ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805)   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.   ASU 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer must record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Additionally, the entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  
 ASU 2015-01,  Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)   Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.   ASU 2015-01 eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items, which, among other things, required an entity to segregate extraordinary items considered to be unusual and infrequent from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. ASU 2015-01 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  
 ASU 2014-12,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.    ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.  Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved.  ASU 2014-12 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.   
 ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).    ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.  Additionally, ASU 2014-09 supersedes some cost guidance included in Revenue Recognition Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts (Subtopic 605-35). In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.   ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Deferral of the Effective Date   deferred the effective date for ASU 2014-09 by one year to January 1, 2018, with retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2014-09, but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.

  4. SECURITIES  
 The amortized cost and fair value of investment securities were as follows: 

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The investment securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI by segregating the portfolio into two general segments and applying the appropriate OTTI analysis.  Investment securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity are evaluated for OTTI under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ):  Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 320,   Investments-Debt and Equity Securities.   
 11 
 
 PROSPERITY BANCSHARES, INC.  AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
 (UNAUDITED) 
   
  In determining OTTI, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time   and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell th  e debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the inf  ormation available to management at a point in time.  
 When OTTI occurs, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. If an entity intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit-related portion of the impairment loss ( credit loss ) and the noncredit portion of the impairment loss ( noncredit portion ). The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis and such difference is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to the noncredit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment. 
 As of September 30, 2016, management does not have the intent to sell any of its investment securities and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, management believes any impairment in the Company s securities is temporary, and therefore no impairment loss has been realized in the Company s consolidated statement of income. 
 Securities with unrealized losses, segregated by length of time, that have been in a continuous loss position were as follows:

 PROSPERITY BANCSHARES, INC.  AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
 (UNAUDITED) 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were 411 securities and 474 securities, respectively, in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. 
 The amortized cost and fair value of investment securities at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations at any time with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

The Company recorded no gain or loss on sale of securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not own any non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations. 
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not own securities of any one issuer (other than the U.S. government and its agencies) for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10% of the consolidated shareholders  equity at such respective dates. 
 Securities with an amortized cost of $5.17 billion and $5.81 billion and a fair value of $5.25 billion and $5.79 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were pledged to collateralize public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law.

  5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE   FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
 The loan portfolio consists of various types of loans and is categorized by major type as follows: 

Concentrations of Credit.  Most of the Company s lending activity occurs within the states of Texas and Oklahoma. The majority of the Company s loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate, 1-4 family residential loans and commercial and industrial loans. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no concentrations of loans related to any single industry in excess of 10% of total loans.  
 Foreign Loans.  The Company has U.S. dollar-denominated loans and commitments to borrowers in Mexico. The outstanding balance of these loans and the unfunded amounts available under these commitments were not significant at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
 Related Party Loans.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans outstanding to directors, officers and their affiliates totaled $4.1 million. All transactions entered into between the Company and such related parties are done in the ordinary course of business and made on the same terms and conditions as similar transactions with unaffiliated persons.  
 An analysis of activity with respect to these related party loans is as follows:   

Nonperforming Assets and Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans.  The Company has several procedures in place to assist it in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio. The Company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers, including requiring appraisals on loans collateralized by real estate. The Company also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. Nevertheless, the Company s loan portfolio could become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions.  
 The Company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when the payment of principal or interest is delinquent for 90 days, or earlier in some cases, unless the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral fully supports the carrying value of the loan. 
 With respect to potential problem loans, an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need, if any, for possible writedowns or appropriate additions to the allowance for credit losses.

  The Company had $  60.2   million in nonperforming assets at September 30, 2016 compared with $43.5 million at December 31, 2015. This   increase   was primarily due to   two commercial real e  st  ate loans and two commercial and   industrial loans  . Nonperforming assets were   0.63  % of total loans and other real estate at September 30, 2016 compared with 0.46% of total loans and other real estate at December 31, 2015. These low nonperforming assets to t  otal loans and other real estate ratios are reflective of the Company s conservative lending approach.  
 If interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued under the original loan terms, approximately $2.2 million and $2.8 million would have been recorded as income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Acquired Loans.   Acquired loans were preliminarily recorded at fair value based on a discounted cash flow valuation methodology that considers, among other things, interest rates, projected default rates, loss given default, and recovery rates (no allowance for credit losses was carried over from the acquisition completed during 2016). During the valuation process, the Company identified Purchased Credit-Impaired ( PCI ) and Non-PCI loans in the acquired loan portfolios. Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration at acquisition for which it was probable that the Company would not be able to collect all contractual amounts due were accounted for as PCI. PCI loan identification considers the following factors: payment history and past due status, debt service coverage, loan grading, collateral values and other factors that may indicate deterioration of credit quality since origination. Non-PCI loan identification considers the following factors: account types, remaining terms, annual interest rates or coupons, current market rates, interest types, past delinquencies, timing of principal and interest payments, loan to value ratios, loss exposures and remaining balances. Accretion of purchased discounts on PCI loans will be based on estimated future cash flows, regardless of contractual maturities. Accretion of purchased discounts on Non-PCI loans will be recognized on a level-yield basis based on contractual maturity of individual loans.  
 PCI Loans.   The carrying amount of PCI loans included in the consolidated balance sheet and the related outstanding balance as of the dates indicated are presented in the table below. The outstanding balance represents the total amount owed as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Changes in the accretable yield for acquired PCI loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

Income recognition on PCI loans is subject to the Company s ability to reasonably estimate both the timing and amount of future cash flows. PCI loans for which the Company is accruing interest income are not considered non-performing or impaired. The non-accretable difference represents contractual principal and interest the Company does not expect to collect.

  Non-PCI Loans.   The carrying amount of Non-PCI loans included in the consolidated balance sheet and the related outstanding balance as of the dates indicated   are presented in the table below. The outstanding balance represents the total amount owed as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, including accrued but unpaid interest.  

Changes in the discount accretion for Non-PCI loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

Impaired Loans.  Loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled principal and interest payments. Impairment is evaluated in total for smaller-balance loans of a similar nature and on an individual loan basis for other loans. If a loan is impaired, a specific valuation allowance is allocated, if necessary, so that the loan is reported net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Interest payments on impaired loans are typically applied to principal unless collectability of the principal amount is reasonably assured, in which case interest is recognized on a cash basis. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible.

Credit Quality Indicators.  As part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio and methodology for calculating the allowance for credit losses, management assigns and tracks loan grades to be used as credit quality indicators. The following is a general description of the loan grades used:  
 Grade 1  Credits in this category have risk potential that is virtually nonexistent.  These loans may be secured by insured certificates of deposit, insured savings accounts, U.S. Government securities and highly rated municipal bonds.  
 Grade 2  Credits in this category are of the highest quality.  These borrowers represent top rated companies and individuals with unquestionable financial standing with excellent global cash flow coverage, net worth, liquidity and collateral coverage.  
 Grade 3  Credits in this category are not immune from risk but are well protected by the collateral and paying capacity of the borrower. These loans may exhibit a minor unfavorable credit factor, but the overall credit is sufficiently strong to minimize the possibility of loss.  
 Grade 4  Credits in this category are considered to be of acceptable credit quality with moderately greater risk than Grade 3 and receiving closer monitoring.  Loans in this category have sources of repayment that remain sufficient to preclude a larger than normal probability of default and secondary sources are likewise currently of sufficient quantity, quality, and liquidity to protect the Company against loss of principal and interest.  These borrowers have specific risk factors, but the overall strength of the credit is acceptable based on other mitigating credit and/or collateral factors and can repay the debt in the normal course of business.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
 (UNAUDITED) 
   
  Grade 5   Credits in this category constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk; however, the factors do not rise to a level of substandard.  These credits have potential weaknesses and/or declining trends that, if not corr  ected, could expose the Bank to risk at a future date.  These loans are monitored on the Bank s internally-generated watch list and evaluated on a quarterly basis.  
 Grade 6  Credits in this category are considered  substandard  but  non-impaired  loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines.  Loans in this category have well-defined weakness that, if not corrected, could make default of principal and interest possible.  Loans in this category are still accruing interest and may be dependent upon secondary sources of repayment and/or collateral liquidation.  
 Grade 7  Credits in this category are deemed  substandard  and  impaired  pursuant to regulatory guidelines. As such, the Bank has determined that it is probable that less than 100% of the contractual principal and interest will be collected. These loans are individually evaluated for a specific reserve and will typically have the accrual of interest stopped.  
 Grade 8  Credits in this category include  doubtful  loans in accordance with regulatory guidance. Such loans are no longer accruing interest and factors indicate a loss is imminent.  These loans are also deemed  impaired.  While a specific reserve may be in place while the loan and collateral is being evaluated, these loans are typically charged down to an amount the Bank estimates is collectible.  
 Grade 9  Credits in this category are deemed a  loss  in accordance with regulatory guidelines and have been charged off or charged down. The Bank may continue collection efforts and may have partial recovery in the future.  
 The following table presents risk grades and PCI loans by category of loan at September 30, 2016. Impaired loans include loans in risk grades 7, 8 and 9, as well as any PCI loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it.

Allowance for Credit Losses.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. Management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the Company s loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is affected by the following: (1) charge offs of loans that occur when loans are deemed uncollectible and decrease the allowance, (2) recoveries on loans previously charged off that increase the allowance and (3) provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance. Based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and consideration of the factors listed below, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions or the borrower s performance differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations.  
 The Company s allowance for credit losses consists of two components: a specific valuation allowance based on probable losses on specifically identified loans and a general valuation allowance based on historical loan loss experience, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. 
 In setting the specific valuation allowance, the Company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to each loan. Through this loan review process, the Company maintains an internal list of impaired loans which, along with the delinquency list of loans, helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. All loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. For certain impaired loans, the Company allocates a specific loan loss reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the impaired loan in accordance with ASC Topic 310-10,   Receivables.   The specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis. Loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general valuation allowance described below. 
 In connection with this review of the loan portfolio, the Company considers risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements include: 

for 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, the borrower s ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt to income ratio and employment and income stability, the loan to value ratio, and the age, condition and marketability of collateral;     

 21 
 
 PROSPERITY BANCSHARES, INC.  AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
 (UNAUDITED) 

for commercial real estate loans and multifamily   residential loans, the debt service coverage ratio (income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements), operating results of the owner in the case of owner-occupied properties, the loan to value ratio, the age   and condition of the collateral and the volatility of income, property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type;     

for construction, land development and other land loans, the perceived feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or the ability to lease property constructed for lease, the quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease, if any, experience and ability of the developer and loan to value ratio;     

for commercial and industrial loans, the operating results of the commercial, industrial or professional enterprise, the borrower s business, professional and financial ability and expertise, the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category and the value, nature and marketability of collateral;     

for agricultural real estate loans, the experience and financial capability of the borrower, projected debt service coverage of the operations of the borrower and loan to value ratio; and     

for non-real estate agricultural loans, the operating results, experience and financial capability of the borrower, historical and expected market conditions and the value, nature and marketability of collateral.     

 In determining the amount of the general valuation allowance, management considers factors such as historical loan loss experience, concentration risk of specific loan types, the volume, growth and composition of the Company s loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the Company s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company and other relevant factors in accordance with ASC Topic 450,   Contingencies.   Based on a review of these factors for each loan type, the Company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance of each loan type, excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it. The Company uses this information to establish the amount of the general valuation allowance. 
 In addition, for each category, the Company considers secondary sources of income and the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and any guarantors. 
 At September 30, 2016, the allowance for credit losses totaled $85.6 million or 0.90% of total loans, including acquired loans with discounts.  At December 31, 2015, the allowance for credit losses totaled $81.4 million or 0.86% of total loans, including acquired loans with discounts.

  Troubled Debt Restructurings.   The restructuring of a loan is considered a  troubled debt restructuring  if both (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and (2) the creditor has granted a concession. Con  cessions may include interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, principal forgiveness, restructuring amortization schedules and other actions intended to minimize potential losses.  Under ASC topic 310-40    Receivables Troubled Debt Restructur  ings by Creditors,    the Company evaluates all loan modifications to identify whether the restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring.  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had $  318   thousand and $607 thousand, respectively, in outstand  ing troubled debt restructurings. The following table presents information regarding the recorded investment of loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

As of September 30, 2016, there have been no defaults on any loans that were modified as troubled debt restructurings during the preceding twelve months.  Default is determined at 90 or more days past due.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company added one loan totaling $154 thousand as a new troubled debt restructuring, of which $152 thousand was still outstanding at September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company added two loans totaling $400 thousand as new troubled debt restructurings, of which $316 thousand was still outstanding at September 30, 2015. The modifications generally related to extending the amortization periods of the loans, which includes loans modified during bankruptcy.  The Company did not grant principal reductions on any restructured loans. These modifications did not have a material impact on the Company s determination of the allowance for credit losses.

  6. FAIR VALUE  
 The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and to determine fair value disclosures. Fair values represent the estimated price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability, otherwise known as an  exit price.   Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis such as certain loans including residential mortgage loans held for sale, goodwill and other intangible assets and other real estate owned. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write downs of individual assets.  ASC Topic 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 
 Fair Value Hierarchy 
 The Company groups financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     

Level 2 Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities) or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.     

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.     

 The fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell that asset or paid to transfer that liability in an orderly transaction occurring in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for such asset or liability. In estimating fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. Such valuation techniques are consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques include the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
 The fair value disclosures below represent the Company s estimates based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. Fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of the various instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in the above methodologies and assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
 The following tables present fair values for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

 (UNAUDITED) 

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). These instruments include other real estate owned, repossessed assets, held to maturity debt securities, loans held for sale and impaired loans, which are included as loans held for investment.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had additions to other real estate owned of $727 thousand and $14.6 million, respectively, of which $727 thousand and $14.4 million were still outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had additions to impaired loans of $15.0 million and $38.9 million, respectively, of which $15.0 million and $31.5 million were still outstanding as of September 30, 2016. The remaining financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis that were recorded in 2016 and remained outstanding at September 30, 2016 were not significant. 
 The following table presents carrying and fair value information of financial instruments as of the dates indicated:

The following is a description of the fair value estimates, methods and assumptions that are used by the Company in estimating the fair values of financial instruments. 
 Cash and due from banks  For these short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The Company classifies the estimated fair value of these instruments as Level 1.  
 Federal funds sold  For these short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.  The Company classifies the estimated fair value of these instruments as Level 1.  
 Securities    Fair value measurements based upon quoted prices are considered Level 1 inputs. Level 1 securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and certain equity securities which are included in the available for sale portfolio. For all other available for sale and held to maturity securities, if quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company generally obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond s terms and conditions, among other things. The Company reviews the prices supplied by the independent pricing service, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness.  
 Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 Loans held for sale   Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. Fair value for consumer mortgages held for sale is based on commitments on hand from investors or prevailing market prices. As such, the Company classifies loans subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as Level 2.  
 Loans held for investment   The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. As such, valuation techniques discussed herein for loans are primarily for estimating fair value disclosures. However, from time to time, the Company records nonrecurring fair value adjustments to impaired loans to reflect (1) partial write downs that are based on the observable market price or current appraised value of the collateral, or (2) the full charge off of the loan carrying value. Where appraisals are not available, estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate commensurate with the credit risk associated with those cash flows. Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows and discount rates are judgmentally determined using available market information and specific borrower information.  
 The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk. The fair value of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans which reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality. An overall valuation adjustment is made for specific credit risks as well as general portfolio credit risk.  The Company classifies the estimated fair value of loans held for investment as Level 3.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 
 (UNAUDITED) 
   
  Other real estate owned    Other real estate owned is primarily foreclosed properties securing residential loans and commercial real estate. Foreclosed assets are adjusted to   fair value less estimated costs to sell upon transfer of the loans to other real estate owned. Subsequently, these assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Other real estate carried at fair value based o  n an observable market price or a current appraised value is classified by the Company as Level     2. When management determines that the fair value of other real estate requires additional adjustments, either as a result of a non-current appraisal or when   there is no observable market price, the Company classifies the other real estate as Level     3.  
 Deposits  The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Deposits fair value measurements utilize Level 2 inputs.  
 Other borrowings  Rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of other borrowings using a discounted cash flows methodology and are measured utilizing Level 2 inputs.  
 Securities sold under repurchase agreements  The fair value of securities sold under repurchase agreements is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date and are measured utilizing Level 2 inputs.  
 Off-balance sheet financial instruments  The fair value of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. The Company has reviewed the unfunded portion of commitments to extend credit as well as standby and other letters of credit, and has determined that the fair value of such financial instruments is not material. The Company classifies the estimated fair value of credit-related financial instruments as Level 3.  
 The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management at September 30, 2016. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those dates and, therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 
   
 7. GOODWILL AND CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES 
 Changes in the carrying amount of the Company s goodwill and core deposit intangibles for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 were as follows:  

Goodwill is recorded on the acquisition date of each entity. The Company may record subsequent adjustments to goodwill for amounts undeterminable at acquisition date, such as deferred taxes and real estate valuations, and therefore the goodwill amounts may change accordingly. The Company initially records the total premium paid on acquisitions as goodwill. After finalizing the valuation, core deposit intangibles are identified and reclassified from goodwill to core deposit intangibles on the balance sheet. This reclassification has no effect on total assets, liabilities, shareholders  equity, net income or cash flows. Management performs an evaluation annually, and more frequently if a triggering event occurs, of whether any impairment of the goodwill and core deposit intangibles has occurred. If any such impairment is determined, a write-down is recorded. As of September 30, 2016, there was no impairment recorded on goodwill and core deposit intangibles.

  The measurement period for the Company to determine th  e fair value of acquired identifiable assets and assumed liabilities will be at the end of the earlier of (1) twelve months from the date of acquisition or (2) as soon as the Company receives the information it was seeking about facts and circumstances tha  t existed as of the date of acquisition.  
 Core deposit intangibles are being amortized on a non-pro rata basis over their estimated lives, which the Company believes is between 10 and 15 years.   Amortization expense related to intangible assets totaled $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $7.0 million and $7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The estimated aggregate future amortization expense for core deposit intangibles remaining as of September 30, 2016 is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

8. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION 
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had two stock-based employee compensation plans with awards outstanding. One of these plans adopted by the Company has expired and therefore no additional awards may be issued under that plan. 
 During 2004, Bancshares  Board of Directors established the Prosperity Bancshares, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2004 Plan ) which was approved by Bancshares  shareholders and authorized the issuance of up to 1,250,000 shares of common stock upon the exercise of options granted under the 2004 Plan or upon the grant or exercise, as the case may be, of other awards granted under the 2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan provided for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options to employees and nonqualified stock options to directors who are not employees. The 2004 Plan also provided for the granting of shares of restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards and performance awards on substantially similar terms. The 2004 Plan has expired and therefore no additional shares may be issued from the 2004 Plan. 
 During 2012, Bancshares  Board of Directors established the Prosperity Bancshares, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2012 Plan ), which was approved by Bancshares  shareholders and authorized the issuance of up to 1,250,000 shares of common stock upon the exercise of options granted under the 2012 Plan or pursuant to the grant or exercise, as the case may be, of other awards granted under the 2012 Plan, including restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards and performance awards. A total of 327,801 shares have been granted under the 2012 Plan as of September 30, 2016.   
 The Company received $469 thousand and $667 thousand from the exercise of stock options during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, and $155 thousand and $223 thousand during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015.  There was no tax benefit realized from option exercises of the stock-based payment arrangements during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
 As of September 30, 2016, there was $19.4 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.60 years.

11. ACQUISITIONS 
 Acquisition of Tradition Bancshares, Inc.    On January 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Tradition and its wholly-owned subsidiary Tradition Bank, headquartered in Houston, Texas. Tradition Bank operated 7 banking offices in the Houston, Texas area, including its main office in Bellaire, 3 banking centers in Katy and 1 banking center in The Woodlands. The acquisition was not considered significant to the Company s financial statements and therefore pro forma financial data and related disclosures are not included.  
 Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Bancshares issued 679,528 shares of its common stock plus $39.0 million in cash for all outstanding shares of Tradition capital stock, for total merger consideration of $71.5 million, based on Bancshares  closing stock price of $47.86 on December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, total goodwill related to the Tradition acquisition was $31.5 million, which does not include subsequent fair value adjustments that are still being finalized. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of both the consideration exchanged and liabilities assumed as compared to the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations analyzes the major elements of the Company s balance sheets and statements of income. This section should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report and with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 OVERVIEW 
 Prosperity Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation, was formed in 1983 to acquire the former Allied First Bank in Edna, Texas, which was chartered in 1949 as The First National Bank of Edna and is now known as Prosperity Bank. The Company is a registered financial holding company that derives substantially all of its revenues and income from the operation of its bank subsidiary, Prosperity Bank   . The Bank provides a wide array of financial products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank operated 245 full-service banking locations; with 65 in the Houston area, including The Woodlands; 29 in the South Texas area including Corpus Christi and Victoria; 36 in the Dallas/Fort Worth area; 22 in the East Texas area; 29 in the Central Texas area including Austin and San Antonio; 34 in the West Texas area including Lubbock, Midland-Odessa and Abilene; 16 in the Bryan/College Station area, 6 in the Central Oklahoma area and 8 in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area.  The Company s principal executive office is located at Prosperity Bank Plaza, 4295 San Felipe in Houston, Texas and its telephone number is (713) 693-9300. The Company s website address is www.prosperitybankusa.com. Information contained on the Company s website is not incorporated by reference into this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and is not part of this or any other report. 
 The Company generates the majority of its revenues from interest income on loans, service charges on customer accounts and income from investment in securities. The revenues are partially offset by interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings and noninterest expenses such as administrative and occupancy expenses. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is the Company s largest source of revenue. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and margin. 
 Three principal components of the Company s growth strategy are internal growth, stringent cost control practices and acquisitions, including strategic merger transactions. The Company focuses on continual internal growth. Each banking center is operated as a separate profit center, maintaining separate data with respect to its net interest income, efficiency ratio, deposit growth, loan growth and overall profitability. Banking center presidents and managers are accountable for performance in these areas and compensated accordingly. The Company also focuses on maintaining stringent cost control practices and policies. The Company has centralized many of its critical operations, such as data processing and loan processing. Management believes that this centralized infrastructure can accommodate substantial additional growth and achieve necessary controls while enabling the Company to minimize operational costs through certain economies of scale.  The Company also intends to continue to seek expansion opportunities. On January 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Tradition Bancshares, Inc. During 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of F M Bancorporation Inc.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported. The Company s accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity: 
 Allowance for Credit Losses    The allowance for credit losses is a valuation established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. The Company s allowance for credit losses consists of two elements, (1) specific valuation allowances based on probable losses on impaired loans and (2) a general valuation allowance based on historical loan loss experience, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. The allowance for acquired credit losses is calculated as described under the heading  Accounting for Acquired Loans and the Allowance for Acquired Credit Losses  below. Management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the Company s loan portfolio. Based on an evaluation of the portfolio, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank s Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. In making its evaluation, management considers factors such as historical loan loss experience, the amount of nonperforming assets and related collateral, the volume, growth and composition of the portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant factors. Portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits; however, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management s judgment, should be charged off. Charge-offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, see  Financial Condition   Allowance for Credit Losses  below.    
 Accounting for Acquired Loans and the Allowance for Acquired Credit Losses    The Company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets, including loans, and liabilities of the acquired entity were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date. No allowance for credit losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date, as the fair value of the acquired loans incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. These fair value estimates associated with acquired loans, and based on a discounted cash flow model, include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal, interest and other cash flows, as well as any shortfalls thereof.  
 At period-end after acquisition, the fair-valued acquired loans from each acquisition are reassessed to determine whether an addition to the allowance for credit losses is appropriate due to further credit quality deterioration. For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses for acquired loans, see  Financial Condition   Allowance for Credit Losses  below. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company s reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. Under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) topic 350-20,  Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill,  companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining the need to perform step one of the annual test for goodwill impairment. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.  
 If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment, a two-step goodwill impairment test is performed. The two-step process begins with an estimation of the fair value of the Company s reporting unit compared with its carrying value. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, a second test is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment. 
 36 

Estimating the fair value of the Company s reporting unit is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to future cash flows of the reporting unit, discount rates (including market risk premiums) a  nd market multiples. Material assumptions used in the valuation tools include the comparable public company price multiples used in the terminal value, future cash flows and the market risk premium component of the discount rate. The estimated fair values   of the reporting unit is determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. The Company gives consideration to both valuation techniques, as either technique can be an indicator of value. For th  e market approach, valuations of the reporting unit were based on an analysis of relevant price multiples in market trades in companies with similar characteristics. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows (derived from internal forecasts and   economic expectations) and terminal value (value at the end of the cash flow period, based on price multiples) were discounted. The discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital.  
 The Company had no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at September 30, 2016.  Other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are being amortized on a non-pro rata basis over the years expected to be benefited, which the Company believes is between ten and fifteen years. These amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value. Based on the Company s annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2016, management does not believe any of its goodwill is impaired as of September 30, 2016 because the fair value of the Company s equity exceeded its carrying value. While the Company believes no impairment existed at September 30, 2016, under accounting standards applicable at that date, different conditions or assumptions, or changes in cash flows or profitability, if significantly negative or unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the Company s impairment evaluation and financial condition or future results of operations. 
 Other-Than-Temporarily Impaired Securities  When the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost, and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair market value is below amortized cost, additional analysis is performed to determine whether an impairment exists. Available for sale and held to maturity securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. The analysis considers (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. Often, the information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing, making estimates of fair value subject to judgment. If actual information or conditions are different than estimated, the extent of the impairment of the security may be different than previously estimated, which could have a material effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.  
 Fair Values of Financial Instruments  The Company determines the fair market values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs include quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available Level 2 inputs are used. These inputs are based upon internally developed analytical tools that primarily use observable market-based parameters. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  
 RECENT ACQUISITIONS 
 Acquisition of Tradition Bancshares, Inc.    On January 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Tradition Bancshares, Inc. ( Tradition ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Tradition Bank headquartered in Houston, Texas. Tradition Bank operated 7 banking offices in the Houston, Texas area, including its main office in Bellaire, 3 banking centers in Katy and 1 banking center in The Woodlands.  As of December 31, 2015, Tradition, on a consolidated basis, reported total assets of $548.0 million, total loans of $253.3 million and total deposits of $488.9 million, each at book value.  
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Net income available to common shareholders was $68.7 million ($0.99 per common share on a diluted basis) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with $70.6 million ($1.01 per common share on a diluted basis) for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, a decrease in net income of $1.9 million or 2.8%. The Company posted annualized returns on average common equity of 7.66% and 8.31%, annualized returns on average assets of 1.27% and 1.30% and efficiency ratios of 43.26% and 40.72% for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total non-interest expense, excluding credit loss provisions, by net interest income plus non-interest income, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of assets. Additionally, taxes are not part of this calculation. 
 37 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income avail  able to common shareholders was   $  205.7   million ($  2.95   per common share on a diluted   basis) compared with $216.2 million ($3.09 per common share on a diluted basis) for the same period in 2015, a   decrease   in net income of $  10.5   million or   4.9  %. The Company posted annualized returns on average common equity of     7.74  % and   8.63%, annualized re  turns on average assets of   1.25  % and 1.33% and efficiency ratios of   42.24  % and 41.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Net Interest Income 
 The Company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a  volume change.  It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a  rate change.  
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016 
 Net interest income before the provision for credit losses was $154.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $2.0 million or 1.3%, compared with $156.1 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in loan discount accretion of $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Interest income on loans was $116.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $664 thousand or 0.6%, compared with $116.9 million for the same period in 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease in loan discount accretion of $3.4 million, partially offset by an increase in average loans of 4.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Interest income on securities was $48.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $478 thousand or 1.0%, compared with $48.6 million for the same period in 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease in average securities of 5.2%, partially offset by a 9 basis point increase in the average yield earned on securities for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities were $12.83 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $233.3 million or 1.8%, compared with $13.06 billion for the same period in 2015. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis decreased from 3.30% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to 3.29% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. This was primarily due to a decrease in loan discount accretion of $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 
 Net interest income before the provision for credit losses was $478.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1.5 million or 0.3%, compared with $477.3 million for the same period in 2015.  The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to a 1.6% increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in loan discount accretion of $12.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Interest income on loans was $359.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $2.1 million or 0.6%, compared with $361.2 million for the same period in 2015. This was primarily due to a decrease in loan discount accretion of $12.9 million and a decrease in the average yield earned on loans, partially offset by an increase in average loans of 5.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company had $67.5 million of total outstanding discounts on acquired loans, of which $50.4 million was accretable at September 30, 2016. 
 Interest income on securities was $151.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $6.1 million or 4.2%, compared with $145.7 million for the same period in 2015. This was primarily due to an 11 basis point increase in the average yield earned on securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities were $13.17 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $12.5 million or 0.1%, compared with $13.16 billion for the same period in 2015. The net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis decreased 4 basis points from 3.42% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 3.38% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was primarily due to a decrease in loan discount accretion of $12.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

 Includes impact of purchase accounting adjustments.    

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 Management actively monitors the Company s asset quality and provides specific loss provisions when necessary. Provisions for credit losses are charged to income to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management of the Company based on such factors as historical credit loss experience, industry diversification of the Company s commercial loan portfolio, the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral, the volume growth and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the loan portfolio through the internal loan review process and other relevant factors. 
 Loans are charged off against the allowance for credit losses when appropriate. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the provision for credit losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations. 
 The Company recorded a $2.0 million provision for credit losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and a $5.3 million provision for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Net charge-offs were $241 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with net charge-offs of $5.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The Company made a $22.0 million provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and a $7.1 million provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Net charge-offs were $17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily due to the charge-offs related to three energy loans and one agricultural loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. See "Financial Condition   Allowance for Credit Losses" below for more information. 
 Noninterest Income 
 The Company s primary sources of recurring noninterest income are NSF fees, credit, debit and ATM card income and service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees which are recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. Noninterest income totaled $29.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $31.8 million for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $2.1 million or 6.6%. This was primarily  
 41 

due to a decrease in brokerage income, NSF fees and other noninterest income  , partially offset by an increase in mortgage income   for the three months ended September 30, 2016.   Noninterest income totaled $  89.0   million for the nine months ended Septemb  er 30, 2016 compared with $90.5 million for the same period in 2015, a   decrease   of $  1.5     million o  r   1.7  %.   This was primarily due to a decrease in brokerage income, net gain on sale of assets and other noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in s  ervice charges on deposit accounts and mortgage income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest income: 

Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense totaled $79.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with $76.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3.0 million or 4.0%. This was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits expense, professional fees and other noninterest expense. Noninterest expense totaled $239.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $235.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3.6 million or 1.5%.  This was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits expense, software amortization and professional fees, partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

 Communications expense includes telephone, data circuits, postage and courier expenses.    

 Income Taxes   
 Income tax expense decreased $1.9 million or 5.4%, to $33.6 million, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with $35.6 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower pre-tax net earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income tax expense totaled $100.8 million, a decrease of $8.1 million or 7.4%, compared with $108.9 million for the same period in 2015.  This decrease was primarily attributable to lower pre-tax net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 32.9% and 33.5%, respectively. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Loan Portfolio 
 The Company separates its loan portfolio into two general categories of loans: (1)  legacy loans,  which are loans originated by Prosperity Bank and made pursuant to the Company s loan policy and procedures in effect at the time the loan was made, and (2)  acquired loans,  which are loans acquired in a business combination and preliminarily recorded at fair value at acquisition date. Those acquired loans that are renewed or substantially modified after the date of the business combination, which therefore causes them to become subject to the Company s allowance for credit losses methodology, are referred to as  acquired legacy loans.  If a renewal or substantial modification of an acquired loan is underwritten by the Company with a new credit analysis, the loan will no longer be categorized as an acquired loan. For example, acquired loans to one borrower may be combined into a new loan with a new loan number and categorized as a legacy loan. Acquired loans with a fair value discount or premium at the date of the business combination that remained at the reporting date are referred to as  fair-valued acquired loans.  All fair-valued acquired loans are further categorized into  PCI loans  (purchased credit-impaired loans) and  Non-PCI loans.  Acquired loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration at acquisition for which it is probable that the Company would not be able to collect all contractual amounts due are PCI loans. 
 43 

The following tables summarize the Company s legacy and acquired loan portfolios broken out into legacy loans, acquired legacy   loans, Non-PCI loans and PCI loans, as of the dates indicated.  

At September 30, 2016, total loans were $9.55 billion, an increase of $109.7 million or 1.2%, compared with $9.44 billion at December 31, 2015. Loans at September 30, 2016 included $29.5 million of loans held for sale compared with $23.9 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, loans represented 44.6% of total assets compared with 42.8% of total assets at December 31, 2015. 
 The loan portfolio consist of various types of loans categorized by major type as follows: 
 (i) Commercial and Industrial Loans.  In nearly all cases, the Company s commercial loans are made in the Company s market areas and are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to service the debt from income. As a general practice, the Company takes as collateral a lien on any available real estate, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and obtains a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. Working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short-term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long-term assets. In general, commercial loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans and, therefore, usually yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans as well as the expectation that commercial loans generally will be serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Historical trends have shown these types of loans to have higher delinquencies than mortgage loans. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans.  
 44 

Included in commercial and industrial loans are commitments to oil and gas producers secured by proven, developed and producing reserves and commitments to serv  ice, equipment and midstream companies secured mainly by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Mineral reserve values supporting commitments to producers are normally re-determined semi-annually using reserve studies prepared by a third-party or th  e Company s oil and gas engineer. Accounts receivable and inventory borrowing bases for service companies are typically re-determined monthly. Funding requests by both producers and service companies are monitored relative to the most recently determined b  orrowing base. As of September 30, 2016  , oil and gas loans totaled $308.9   million or   3.2  % of total loans, of which $  139.9   million were to production companies and $  169.0   million were to service companies. This compares with total oil and gas loans of $399.  1 million or 4.2% of total loans as of December 31, 2015, of which $178.6 million were to production companies and $220.5 million were to service companies. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had total unfunded commitments to oil a  nd gas co  mpanies of $154.2 million, of which $70.5   million were to production companies and $  83.7   million were to service companies. This compares with total unfunded commitments to oil and gas companies of $196.4 million as of December 31, 2015, of which $80.3 mil  lion were to production companies and $116.1 million were to service companies. Total unfunded commitments to producers include letters of credit issued in lieu of oil well plugging bonds.  
 (ii) Commercial Real Estate.  The Company makes commercial real estate loans collateralized by owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied real estate to finance the purchase of real estate. The Company s commercial real estate loans are collateralized by first liens on real estate, typically have variable interest rates (or five year or less fixed rates) and amortize over a 15- to 20-year period. Payments on loans secured by nonowner-occupied properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans. The Company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including giving careful consideration to the property s operating history, future operating projections, current and projected occupancy, location and physical condition in connection with underwriting these loans. The underwriting analysis also includes credit verification, analysis of global cash flow, appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower. At September 30, 2016, approximately 40.2% of the outstanding principal balance of the Company s commercial real estate loans including farmland were secured by owner-occupied properties.  
 (iii) 1-4 Family Residential Loans.  The Company s lending activities also include the origination of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans (including home equity loans) collateralized by owner-occupied residential properties located in the Company s market areas. The Company offers a variety of mortgage loan portfolio products which generally are amortized over five to 25 years. Loans collateralized by 1-4 family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than 89% of appraised value or have mortgage insurance. The Company requires mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance. The Company retains these portfolio loans for its own account rather than selling them into the secondary market. By doing so, the Company incurs interest rate risk as well as the risks associated with nonpayments on such loans. The Company s Home Loan Center offers a variety of mortgage loan products which are generally amortized over 30 years, including FHA and VA loans. The Company sells the loans originated by the Home Loan Center into the secondary market.  
 (iv) Construction, Land Development and Other Land Loans.  The Company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and, to a lesser extent, nonresidential properties. Construction loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates. The Company conducts periodic inspections, either directly or through an agent, prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans. Underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the Company s construction lending activities. Construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio. As a result of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, the Company may not be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time. Although the Company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending, these procedures may not prevent losses from the risks described above.  
 (v) Agriculture Loans.  The Company provides agriculture loans for short-term beef and crop production, including rice, cotton, milo and corn, farm equipment financing and agriculture real estate financing. The Company evaluates agriculture borrowers primarily based on their historical profitability, level of experience in their particular agriculture industry, overall financial capacity and the availability of secondary collateral to withstand economic and natural variations common to the industry. Because agriculture loans present a higher level of risk associated with events caused by nature, the Company routinely makes on-site visits and inspections in order to identify and monitor such risks.  
 45 

(vi) Consumer Loans.   Consumer loans made by the Company include direct  A -cr  edit automobile loans, recreational vehicle loans, boat loans, home improvement loans, personal loans (collateralized and uncollateralized), credit cards and deposit account collateralized loans. The terms of these loans typically range from 12 to 180 mont  hs and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan. Generally, consumer loans entail greater risk than do real estate secured loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or collateralized by rapidly depreciating asset  s such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection   efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or p  ersonal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.  
 The Company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company s policies and procedures. 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, accruing loans 90 days past due or more and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition. Nonperforming assets do not include PCI loans unless the timing and amount of projected cash flows can no longer be reasonably estimated. PCI loans become subject to the Company's allowance for credit losses methodology when a deterioration in projected cash flows is identified. 
 The Company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when the payment of principal or interest is delinquent for 90 days, or earlier in some cases, unless the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral fully supports the carrying value of the loan. 
 Nonperforming assets increased $16.7 million or 38.4%, to $60.2 million, at September 30, 2016 compared with $43.5 million at December 31, 2015, of which $32.3 million and $22.0 million, respectively, were attributable to acquired loans. This increase was primarily attributable to two commercial real estate loans and two commercial and industrial loans. 
 The following tables present information regarding nonperforming assets differentiated among legacy loans, acquired legacy loans, Non-PCI loans and PCI loans, as of the dates indicated: 

46 

Nonperforming assets were 0.63% of total loans and other real estate at September 30, 2016 compared with 0.46% of total loans and other real estate at December 31, 2015. Nonperforming assets attributable to legacy loans were 0.37% of total legacy loans and other real estate at September 30, 2016 compared with 0.31% of total legacy loans and other real estate at December 31, 2015. Nonperforming assets attributable to acquired legacy loans were 2.72% of total acquired legacy loans and other real estate at September 30, 2016 compared with 0.80% of total acquired legacy loans and other real estate at December 31, 2015. Nonperforming assets attributable to Non-PCI loans were 0.47% of total Non-PCI loans and other real estate at September 30, 2016 compared with 0.44% of total Non-PCI loans and other real estate at December 31, 2015. Nonperforming assets attributable to PCI loans were 10.75% of total PCI loans and other real estate at September 30, 2016 compared with 19.49% of total PCI loans and other real estate at December 31, 2015. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 195.2% at September 30, 2016 and 201.8% at December 31, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had one loan modified in troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) with a balance of $154 thousand at the date of restructure and a remaining recorded investment of $152 thousand at September 30, 2016. Total TDRs outstanding totaled $318 thousand at September 30, 2016. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The following table presents, as of and for the periods indicated, an analysis of the allowance for credit losses and other related data: 

47 

The allowance for credit losses is a valuation established through   charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. Management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the Company s loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is   affected by the following: (1) charge offs of loans that occur when loans are deemed uncollectible and decrease the allowance, (2) recoveries on loans previously charged off that increase the allowance and (3) provisions for credit losses charged to earni  ngs that increase the allowance. Based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and consideration of the factors listed below, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the Bank s Board of Directors, indicating any change i  n the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments   may be necessary if economic conditions or the borrower s performance differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations.  
 The Company s allowance for credit losses consists of two components: a specific valuation allowance based on probable losses on specifically identified loans and a general valuation allowance based on historical loan loss experience, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. 
 In setting the specific valuation allowance, the Company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to each loan. Through this loan review process, the Company maintains an internal list of impaired loans which, along with the delinquency list of loans, helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. All loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. For certain impaired loans, the Company allocates a specific loan loss reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the impaired loan. The specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis. Loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general valuation allowance described below. 
 In determining the amount of the general valuation allowance, management considers factors such as historical loan loss experience, concentration risk of specific loan types, the volume, growth and composition of the Company s loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay and the value of collateral, the evaluation of the Company s loan portfolio through its internal loan review process, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company and other relevant factors. Based on a review of these factors for each loan type, the Company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance of each loan type, excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it. The Company uses this information to establish the amount of the general valuation allowance. 
 A change in the allowance for credit losses can be attributable to several factors, most notably (1) specific reserves identified for impaired loans, (2) historical credit loss information, (3) changes in environmental factors and (4) growth in the balance of legacy loans and the re-categorization of fair-valued acquired loans to acquired legacy loans, which subjects such loans to the allowance methodology. 
 Changes in the Company s asset quality are reflected in the allowance in several ways. Specific reserves that are calculated on a loan-by-loan basis and the qualitative assessment of all other loans reflect current changes in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Historical credit losses, on the other hand, are based on a three-year look back period, which are then applied to estimate current credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. A deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio in the current period would increase the historical credit loss factor to be applied in future periods, just as an improvement in credit quality would decrease the historical credit loss factor. 
 The allowance for credit losses is further determined by the size of the loan portfolio subject to the allowance methodology and environmental factors that include Company-specific risk indicators and general economic conditions, both of which are constantly changing. The Company evaluates the economic and portfolio-specific factors on a quarterly basis to determine a qualitative component of the general valuation allowance. The factors include economic metrics, business conditions, delinquency trends, credit concentrations, nature and volume of the portfolio and other adjustments for items not covered by specific reserves and historical loss experience.  Management s assessment of qualitative factors is a statistically based approach to determine the inherent probable loss associated with such factors. Based on the Company s actual historical loan loss experience relative to economic and loan portfolio-specific factors at the time the losses occurred, management is able to identify the probabilities of default and loss severity based on current economic conditions. The correlation of historical loss experience with current economic conditions provides an estimate of inherent and probable losses that has not been previously factored into the general valuation allowance by the determination of specific reserves and recent historical losses.  Additionally, the Company considers qualitative factors not easily quantified and the possibility of model imprecision. 
 Utilizing the aggregation of specific reserves, historical loss experience and a qualitative component, management is able to determine the valuation allowance to reflect the full inherent probable loss. 
 48 

In determining the allowance for credit loss  es, management also considers the type of loan (legacy or acquired) and the credit quality of the loan. The Company delineates between legacy loans and acquired legacy loans, which are accounted for under the contractual yield method, and fair-valued acqui  red loans consisting of Non-PCI loans and PCI loans, which are accounted for as purchased loans.  
 Loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value, which includes an estimate of inherent credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for credit losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition.  When a fair-valued acquired loan is renewed at its maturity date, the loan is re-categorized as an acquired legacy loan. When a fair-valued acquired loan is modified after acquisition, the loan is independently evaluated subsequent to the modification decision to determine whether the modification was substantial, and therefore, requires that the loan be re-categorized as an acquired legacy loan.  This determination is based on a discounted cash-flow analysis.  Generally, when a change in discounted cash-flow of greater than 10% is identified, the fair-valued acquired loan becomes categorized as an acquired legacy loan.  If and when a fair-valued acquired loan becomes an acquired legacy loan, the acquired legacy loan is evaluated at the time of renewal or modification in accordance with the Company s allowance for credit losses methodology described above. 
 Non-PCI loans which were not deemed impaired subsequent to the acquisition date are considered non-impaired and are evaluated as part of the general valuation allowance.  Non-PCI loans that have not become impaired subsequent to acquisition are segregated into a pool for each acquisition for allowance calculation purposes.  For each pool, the Company estimates a hypothetical allowance for credit losses also referred to as an  indicated reserve  that is calculated in accordance with GAAP requirements.  The Company uses the acquired bank s past loss history adjusted for qualitative factors to establish the indicated reserve.  The indicated reserve for each pool of Non-PCI loans is compared with the remaining discount for the respective pool to test for credit quality deterioration and the possible need for a loan loss provision.  To the extent the remaining discount of the pool is greater than the indicated reserve, no additional allowance is necessary. In the event that the remaining discount of the pool is less than the indicated reserve, the difference results in an increase to the allowance recorded through a provision for credit losses. 
 Non-PCI loans that have deteriorated to an impaired status subsequent to acquisition are evaluated for a specific reserve on a quarterly basis which, when identified, is added to the allowance for credit losses. The Company reviews impaired Non-PCI loans on a loan-by-loan basis and determines the specific reserve based on the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and one of three factors: expected future cash flows, observable market price or fair value of the collateral. Because essentially all of the Company s impaired Non-PCI loans have been collateral-dependent, the amount of the specific reserve historically has been determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral securing the Non-PCI loan with the recorded investment in such loan. In the future, the Company will continue to analyze impaired Non-PCI loans on a loan-by-loan basis and may use an alternative measurement method to determine the specific reserve, as appropriate and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
 PCI loans are individually monitored on a quarterly basis to assess for deterioration subsequent to acquisition and are only subject to the Company s allowance methodology when a deterioration in projected cash flows is identified.  In the event that a deterioration in projected cash flows is identified, an additional provision for credit losses is made.  PCI loans were recorded at their acquisition date fair values, which were based on expected cash flows and included estimates of expected future credit losses. The Company s estimates of loan fair values at the acquisition date may be adjusted for a period of up to one year as the Company continues to evaluate its estimate of expected future cash flows at the acquisition date. If the Company determines that losses arose after the acquisition date, the additional losses will be reflected as a provision for credit losses.  An allowance for credit losses is not calculated for PCI loans that have not experienced deterioration subsequent to the acquisition date.  See  Critical Accounting Policies  above for more information. 
 As described in the section captioned  Critical Accounting Policies  above, the Company s determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The Company s analysis of qualitative, or environmental, factors on pools of loans with common risk characteristics, in combination with the quantitative historical loss information and specific reserves, provides the Company with an estimate of inherent losses. The allowance must reflect changes in the balance of loans subject to the allowance methodology, as well as the estimated imminent losses associated with those loans. 
 49 

The following tables present, as of and for the periods indicated, information regarding the allowance for credit losses differentiated between legacy loans and acquired loans. The charge-offs and recoverie  s with respect to the acquired loans shown below are primarily from acquired legacy loans. Reported net charge-offs may include those from Non-PCI loans and PCI loans, but only if the total charge-off required is greater than the remaining discount.  

The Company had gross charge-offs on legacy loans of $15.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Partially offsetting these charge-offs were recoveries on legacy loans of $3.3 million. Total charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $22.4 million, partially offset by total recoveries of $4.6 million. 
 50 

The following tables show the allocation of the allowance for credit losses among various categories of loans disaggregated between legacy loans, acquired legacy loans, Non-PCI loans and PCI l  oans at the dates indicated. The allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any loan category, regardless of whethe  r allocated to a legacy loan or an acquired loan.  

At September 30, 2016, the allowance for credit losses totaled $85.6 million compared with $81.4 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $4.2 million or 5.2%. The allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2016 totaled 0.90% of total loans compared with 0.86% of total loans at December 31, 2015. 
 At September 30, 2016, $71.6 million of the allowance was attributable to legacy loans, an increase of $6.7 million or 10.3%, compared with the allowance of $64.9 million attributable to legacy loans at December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the legacy loan balance. At September 30, 2016, $13.6 million of the allowance for credit losses was attributable to acquired legacy loans compared with $13.3 million of the allowance at December 31, 2015, an increase of $322 thousand or 2.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to specific reserves identified for loans with deteriorated credit quality, partially offset by a decrease in the acquired legacy loan balance.  At September 30, 2016, $124 thousand of the allowance for credit losses was attributable to Non-PCI loans compared with $2.3 million of the allowance at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $2.2 million or 94.6%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the charge off of loans that had specific reserves identified at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, $224 thousand of the allowance for credit losses was attributable to PCI loans compared with $836 thousand of the allowance at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $612 thousand or 73.2%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the charge off of one loan that had specific reserves identified at December 31, 2015. 
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had $67.5 million of total outstanding discounts on Non-PCI and PCI loans, of which $50.4 million was accretable.   
 The Company believes that the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2016 is adequate to cover estimated losses in the loan portfolio as of such date. Nevertheless, the Company could sustain losses in future periods, which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at September 30, 2016. 
 Securities 
 The carrying cost of securities totaled $8.99 billion at September 30, 2016 compared with $9.50 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $514.4 million or 5.4%. At September 30, 2016, securities represented 42.0% of total assets compared with 43.1% of total assets at December 31, 2015. 
 51 

The amortized cost and fair value of investment securities were as follows:  

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. In determining OTTI, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. 
 When OTTI occurs under either model, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. If an entity intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the OTTI shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  
 52 

less any current-period loss, the OTTI shall be s  eparated into the amount representing the credit-related portion of the impairment loss ( credit loss ) and the noncredit portion of the impairment loss ( noncredit portion ). The amount of the total OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on t  he difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis and such difference is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total OTTI related to the noncredit portion is recognized in other comprehensive in  come, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings shall become the new amortized cost basis of the investment.  
 As of September 30, 2016, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, management believes any impairment in the Company s securities is temporary, and therefore no impairment loss has been realized in the Company s consolidated statements of income. 
 Deposits 
 Total deposits were $16.92 billion at September 30, 2016 compared with $17.68 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $759.7 million or 4.3%.  At September 30, 2016, noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $5.16 billion compared with $5.14 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $22.8 million or 0.4%. Interest-bearing deposits totaled $11.76 billion at September 30, 2016 compared with $12.54 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $782.5 million or 6.2%. 
 Average deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $17.47 billion, an increase of $247.8 million or 1.4%, compared with $17.22 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Deposit growth was impacted by the acquisition of Tradition. Deposits for Tradition totaled $488.9 million at acquisition date. The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 70.9% during the first nine months of 2016 compared to 71.0% during the first nine months of 2015. 
 The following table summarizes the daily average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated below: 

Other Borrowings 
 The following table presents the Company s borrowings as of the dates indicated: 

53 

FHLB advances and long-term notes payable    The Company has an available line of credit with the FHLB of Dallas, which   allows the Company to borrow on a collateralized basis. FHLB advances are considered short-term, overnight borrowings and are used to manage liquidity as needed.  Maturing advances are replaced by drawing on available cash, making additional borrowings or   through increased customer deposits.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had total funds of $  5.37   billion available under this agreement, of which $  425.9   million was outstanding.  Short-term overnight FHLB advances of $  420.0   million were outstanding at Sep  tember 30, 2016, at a weighted average rate of   0.46  %.  Long-term notes payable were $  5.9   million at September 30, 2016, with a weighted average rate of   5.65  %. The maturity dates on the FHLB notes payable range from the years 201  8   to 2027 and have interest   rates ranging from   4.51  % to   6.10  %.  
 Securities sold under repurchase agreements   At September 30, 2016, the Company had $318.4 million in securities sold under repurchase agreements with banking customers compared with $315.3 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $3.2 million or 1.0%.  Repurchase agreements are generally settled on the following business day; however, approximately $6.2 million of the repurchase agreements outstanding at September 30, 2016 have maturity dates ranging from 12 to 24 months. All securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized by certain pledged securities.  
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity involves the Company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the Company on an ongoing basis. The Company s largest source of funds is deposits and its largest use of funds is loans. The Company does not expect a change in the source or use of its funds in the future. Although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities, the Company does not generally rely on these external funding sources. The cash and federal funds sold position, supplemented by amortizing investment and loan portfolios, has generally created an adequate liquidity position. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding $1.98 billion in commitments to extend credit and $70.6 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 
 The Company has no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature. 
 Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $342.1 million compared with $564.0 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $221.8 million or 39.3%. The decrease was primarily due to the net decrease in deposits of $1.25 billion and the purchase of held to maturity securities of $655.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and principal paydowns of held to maturity securities of $1.41 billion and net income of $205.7 million. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The following table summarizes the Company s contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of September 30, 2016 (other than deposit obligations). The payments do not include pre-payment options that may be available to the Company. The Company s future cash payments associated with its contractual obligations pursuant to its FHLB borrowings and operating leases as of September 30, 2016 are summarized below. Payments for FHLB borrowings include interest of $760 thousand that will be paid over the future periods.  Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in underlying contracts. 

Off-Balance Sheet Items 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various transactions, which, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), are not included in its consolidated balance sheets. The Company enters into these  
 54 

transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions includ  e commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.  
 The Company s commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit as of September 30, 2016 are summarized below. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements: 

Capital Resources 
 Total shareholders  equity was $3.59 billion at September 30, 2016 compared with $3.46 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $131.9 million or 3.8%. The increase was primarily the result of net income of $205.7 million and common stock issued in connection with the Tradition acquisition of $32.5 million, partially offset by dividends paid on common stock of $62.6 million and common stock repurchases of $51.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules adopted by the federal regulatory authorities in 2013 substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions. Among other things, the Basel III Capital Rules introduced a new capital measure called  Common Equity Tier 1,  which is a comparison of the sum of certain equity capital components to total risk-weighted assets, and revised the risk-weighting approach of the capital ratios with a more risk-sensitive approach that expanded the risk-weighting categories from the previous Basel I-derived categories to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets. 
 Additionally, the Basel III Capital Rules introduced a capital conservation buffer with respect to each of the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios, which provides for capital levels that exceed the minimum risk-based capital adequacy requirements.  The capital conservation buffer is subject to a three year phase-in period that began on January 1, 2016 and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019 at 2.5%.  The required phase-in capital conservation buffer during 2016 is 0.625%.  A financial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount will be subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 
 Financial institutions are categorized by the FDIC based on minimum Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank s capital ratios were above the levels required for the Bank to be designated as  well capitalized.  
 55 

The following table p  rovides a comparison of the Company s and the Bank s risk-weighted and leverage capital ratios to the minimum and well-capitalized regulatory standards as of September 30, 2016:  

(1)   
 
 The Federal Reserve Board may require the Company to maintain a leverage ratio above the required minimum.    

(2)   
 
 The FDIC may require the Bank to maintain a leverage ratio above the required minimum.    

ITEM  3.   
 
   QUANTITATIVE AN  D QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

 The Company manages market risk, which for the Company is primarily interest rate risk, through its Asset Liability Committee which is composed of senior officers of the Company, in accordance with policies approved by the Company s Board of Directors. 
 The Company uses simulation analysis to examine the potential effects of market changes on net interest income and market value. The Company considers macroeconomic variables, Company strategy, liquidity and other factors as it quantifies market risk. See Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 29, 2016, for further discussion. 

ITEM  4.   
 
     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting.  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM  1.   
 
     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company and Bank believe, after consultations with legal counsel, that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions will not have a material adverse effect on their financial statements.
