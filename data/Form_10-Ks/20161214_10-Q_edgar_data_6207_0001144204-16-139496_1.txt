 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

 Six Months Ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 

(1)     BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared by AMREP Corporation (the  Company ) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for interim financial information, and do not include all the information and footnotes
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. The Company,
through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in two business segments: the real estate business operated by AMREP Southwest Inc.
( AMREP Southwest ) and its subsidiaries and the Fulfillment Services business operated by Palm Coast Data LLC ( Palm
Coast ) and its affiliates. The Company s foreign sales are insignificant. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

In the opinion of management, these unaudited
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary to reflect
a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for such interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of what may occur in future periods. Unless otherwise qualified, all references to 2017 and 2016 are to
the fiscal years ending April 30, 2017 and 2016 and all references to the second quarter and first six months of 2017 and 2016
mean the fiscal three and six month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements
herein should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016, which
was filed with the SEC on July 29, 2016 (the  2016 Form 10-K ). 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation:
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The update simplifies several aspects of accounting for employee share-based
payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well
as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 by the Company is not expected
to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
 Leases . ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee
should recognize in its balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing
its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, a lessee is permitted
to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition,
lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified
retrospective approach. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company for fiscal year 2020 beginning on May 1, 2019. The Company
has not determined the transition approach that will be utilized or estimated the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This guidance defines how companies report revenues from contracts with customers
and also requires enhanced disclosures. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date by one year, with early adoption
on the original effective date permitted. The Company will be required to adopt ASU 2014-09 as of May 1, 2018 and early adoption
is permitted as of May 1, 2017. The Company has not determined when it will adopt ASU 2014-09 and the transition approach that
will be utilized or estimated the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09. 

(2)       RECEIVABLES    

Receivables, net consist of the following (in thousands):

or 13.4%, of total revenues for the Company. As of November 30, 2016, the Company s Fulfillment Services business had $295,000

(7)     NOTES PAYABLE   

Notes payable consist of the following (in
thousands): 

Real Estate Related Party Loan  

AMREP Southwest has a loan from a company owned
by Nicholas G. Karabots, a significant shareholder of the Company and in which another director of the Company has a 20% participation.
The loan had an outstanding principal amount of $3,655,000 at October 31, 2016, is scheduled to mature on December 1, 2017, bears
interest payable monthly at 8.5% per annum and is secured by a mortgage on all real property of AMREP Southwest in Rio Rancho,
New Mexico and by a pledge of the stock of its subsidiary, Outer Rim Investments, Inc. The total book value of the real property
collateralizing the loan was approximately $55,430,000 as of October 31, 2016. The loan may be prepaid at any time without premium
or penalty except if the prepayment is in connection with the disposition of AMREP Southwest or substantially all of its assets.
No payments of principal are required until maturity, except that the following amounts are required to be applied to the payment
of the loan: (a) 25% of the net cash proceeds from any sales of real property by AMREP Southwest and (b) 25% of any royalty payments
received by AMREP Southwest under the oil and gas lease described in Note 8. 

Other Notes Payable  

A subsidiary of AMREP Southwest had a loan
agreement with U.S. Bank National Association for the construction of a 2,200 square foot, single tenant retail building in Rio
Rancho, New Mexico. The loan was scheduled to mature on October 31, 2016, bore interest payable monthly on the outstanding principal
amount at 0.5% plus the prime rate, was secured by a mortgage on the real property of approximately one acre where construction
of the building had occurred, contained customary events of default, representations, warranties and covenants for a loan of this
nature and was guaranteed by AMREP Southwest. As of April 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of the loan was $555,000.
In the first quarter of 2017, this property was sold and the outstanding loan balance was satisfied with proceeds from the sale. 

(8)     OTHER REVENUES   

During the first quarter of 2017, a subsidiary
of AMREP Southwest sold a single tenant retail commercial building in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, which resulted in a pre-tax gain
of $1,496,000. 

In addition, refer to Note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements contained in the 2016 Form 10-K for detail about the Oil and Gas Lease and the Addendum thereto with Thrust
Energy, Inc. and Cebolla Roja, LLC. No royalties under the Lease were received during the first six months of 2017. Revenue from
this transaction is being recorded over the lease term and approximately $57,000 and $114,000 were recognized during the second
quarter and first six months of 2017 and 2016. At October 31, 2016, there was $417,000 of deferred revenue remaining to be recognized
in future periods. 

(9)     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

The Financial Instruments Topic of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments,
whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The Topic excludes all nonfinancial
instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying
value of the Company. The following methods and assumptions are used in estimating fair value disclosure for financial instruments:
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables approximate fair value because of the short
maturity of these financial instruments. 

The Company did not have any long-term, fixed-rate
notes receivable at October 31, 2016 or April 30, 2016. The estimated fair value of the Company s long-term, fixed-rate note
payable was $3,340,000 and $11,102,000 compared with carrying amounts of $3,655,000 and $12,384,000 at October 31, 2016 and April
30, 2016. 

Retirement plan  

The Company has a defined benefit retirement
plan for which accumulated benefits were frozen and future service credits were curtailed as of March 1, 2004. The Company has
secured $5,019,000 of accrued pension-related obligations with first lien mortgages on certain real property in favor of the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the  PBGC ). On an annual basis, the Company is required to provide updated appraisals
on each mortgaged property and, if the appraised value of the mortgaged properties is less than two times the amount of the accrued
pension-related obligations secured by the mortgages, the Company is required to make a payment to its pension plan in an amount
equal to one-half of the amount of the shortfall. During the first six months of 2017, there was no change in the appraised value
of the mortgaged property that required the Company to make any additional payments to its pension plan. 

Equity compensation plan  

The Company issued 19,500 shares of restricted
common stock under the AMREP Corporation 2006 Equity Compensation Plan (the  2006 Equity Plan )  during
the first six months of 2017. During the first six months of 2017, 11,000 share s of common stock previously issued under
the 2006 Equity Plan  vested. In addition, 1,000 shares of restricted stock issued under the
2006 Equity Plan prior to 2017 were returned to the Company and will not vest due to the retirement of an employee, leaving 26,500
shares issued under the 2006 Equity Plan that were not vested as of October 31, 2016.  For the second quarter and first six
months of 2017, the Company recognized $20,000 and $35,000 of compensation expense related to the restricted  share s
of common stock issued, and $16,000 and $37,000 for the same periods of 2016.  As of October 
31, 2016 , there was $92 ,000  of total unrecognized
compensation expense related to share s of common stock issued under the 2006 Equity Plan which had not vested as of that
date , which is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting term not to exceed three
years.  

During
the second quarter of 2017, the shareholders of the Company, at the Company s 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, approved
the AMREP Corporation 2016 Equity Compensation Plan (the  2016 Equity Plan ). The 2016 Equity Plan became effective
on September 20, 2016 and authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock. The 2016 Equity
Plan terminates on, and no award will be granted under the 2016 Equity Plan on or after, September 19, 2026; provided, however,
that the Company s Board of Directors may, at any time prior to that date, terminate the 2016 Equity Plan. No awards were
issued under the 2016 Equity Plan during the second quarter of 2017.   

As previously
disclosed, on the last trading day of calendar year 2016, each non-employee member of the Company s Board of Directors will
be issued the number of deferred common share units of the Company under the 2016 Equity Plan equal to $15,000 divided by the closing
price per share of common stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange on such date. On the last trading day of each calendar
year after calendar year 2016, each non-employee member of the Company s Board of Directors will be issued the number of
deferred common share units of the Company under the 2016 Equity Plan equal to $20,000 divided by the closing price per share of
Common Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange on such date.   

(11)     INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY S OPERATIONS IN DIFFERENT   INDUSTRY SEGMENTS     

The following tables set forth summarized data
relative to the industry segments in which the Company operated for the three and six month periods ended October 31, 2016 and
2015 (in thousands): 

(a)  Revenue information provided for each segment includes amounts grouped as Other in the accompanying

or loss for segment performance and evaluation purposes.   

Item 2.        Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     

INTRODUCTION   

AMREP Corporation (the  Company ),
through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in two business segments: the real estate business operated by AMREP Southwest Inc.
( AMREP Southwest ) and its subsidiaries and the Fulfillment Services business operated by Palm Coast Data LLC ( Palm
Coast ) and its affiliates. Information concerning industry segments is set forth in Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements included in this report on Form 10-Q. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. The Company s foreign sales and activities are not significant. 

The following provides information that management
believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company s consolidated results of operations and financial
condition. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements
and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and with the 2016 Form 10-K. Many of the amounts
and percentages presented in this section have been rounded for convenience of presentation. Unless otherwise qualified, all references
to 2017 and 2016 are to the fiscal years ending April 30, 2017 and 2016 and all references to the second quarter and first six
months of 2017 and 2016 mean the fiscal three and six month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

Management s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations is based on the accounting policies used and disclosed in the 2016 consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and included as part of the 2016 Form 10-K. The preparation of those consolidated financial statements
required management to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts or results could differ from those estimates. 

The critical accounting policies, assumptions
and estimates are described in Item 7 of Part II of the 2016 Form 10-K. There have been no changes in these accounting policies. 

The significant accounting policies of the
Company are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2016 Form 10-K. Information concerning
the Company s implementation and the impact of recent accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2016 Form 10-K and the unaudited consolidated
financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The Company did not adopt
any accounting policy in the first six months of 2017 that had a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

For the second quarter of 2017, the Company
recorded net income of $112,000, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $676,000 or $0.08 per share, for the second quarter
of 2016. For the first six months of 2017, the Company recorded net income of $742,000, or $0.09 per share, compared to a net loss
of $1,855,000, or $0.23 per share, for the same period of 2016. Revenues were   $11,465,000 and
$23,673,000 for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to $11,221,000 and $20,796,000 for the same periods of
the prior year. 

Revenues from the Company s real estate
land sales were $3,529,000 and $6,249,000 for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to $2,180,000 and $2,290,000
for the same periods of 2016. For the second quarter and first six months of 2017 and 2016, the Company s land sales in New
Mexico were as follows: 

The average gross profit percentage on land
sales was 16.6% and 11.6% for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to 13.7% and 16.2% for the same periods
of 2016. As a result of many factors, including the nature and timing of specific transactions and the type and location of land
being sold, revenues, average selling prices and related average gross profits from land sales can vary significantly from period
to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods. 

Revenues from the Company s Fulfillment
Services operations decreased from $8,726,000 and $17,907,000 for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 to $7,858,000
and $15,686,000 for the same periods in 2017. The lower revenues were attributable to reduced business volumes from existing customers,
certain price concessions on renewed contracts and lost business. Magazine publishers are one of the principal customers of the
Company s Fulfillment Services operations, and these customers have continued to be negatively impacted by increased competition
from new media sources, alternative technologies for the distribution, storage and consumption of media content, weakness in advertising
revenues and increases in paper costs, printing costs and postal rates. The result has been reduced subscription sales, which has
caused publishers to close some magazine titles, change subscription fulfillment providers and seek more favorable terms from Palm
Coast and its competitors when contracts are up for bid or renewal. One customer of the Fulfillment Services business whose revenues
were 10.5% of the total Company revenues for the first six months of 2017 has given notice, as previously disclosed by the Company,
that a significant portion of its business will be transferred to another provider during 2017. Operating expenses for Fulfillment
Services decreased from $7,867,000 and $16,647,000 for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 to $6,707,000 and $13,380,000
for the same periods in 2017, primarily reflecting lower payroll and benefits as well as lower supplies expense, in each case primarily
resulting from reduced business volumes, and reduced consulting costs. 

Other revenues were $78,000 and $1,738,000
for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to $315,000 and $599,000 for the same periods of 2016. The decrease
in other revenues for the second quarter was attributable to the sale of a warehouse in February 2016 that was leased to a third
party and therefore there was no rental income in 2017. The increase in other revenues for the first six months was primarily
due to the sale of a retail commercial property previously held for investment by a subsidiary of AMREP Southwest, which resulted
in a pre-tax gain of $1,496,000. 

Other operating expenses were $390,000 and
$760,000 for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to $333,000 and $680,000 for the same periods of 2016. The
increases in the second quarter and first six months were primarily due to increased land maintenance costs and professional fees
at AMREP Southwest and its subsidiaries. 

General and administrative expenses of Fulfillment
Services operations declined to $327,000 and $680,000 for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 from $880,000 and $1,745,000
for the same periods of 2016, primarily due to (i) reduced facilities costs of $117,000 and $180,000 for the second quarter and
first six months and (ii) reduced amortization of $355,000 and $701,000 for the second quarter and first six months that was related
to certain intangible assets, which were determined to be impaired at April 30, 2016. The carrying value of these intangible assets
was written down at April 30, 2016, significantly reducing the amortization of these assets from 2016 to 2017. 

Real estate operations and corporate general
and administrative expenses declined to $878,000 and $1,880,000 for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 from $946,000
and $1,965,000 for the same periods of 2016, primarily due to lower payroll and benefit costs and directors fees, partially offset
by increased pension costs. 

Interest expense was $82,000 and $306,000 for
the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to $364,000 and $743,000 for the same periods of 2016, primarily due to
a reduction of the principal loan balance at AMREP Southwest. Capitalized interest related to various land development activities
for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 was $20,000 and $38,000 compared to none for the same periods of the prior
year. 

The Company s effective tax rate was
6.7% and 31.7% for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to 38.9% and 38.4% for the same periods of 2016. The
difference between the federal statutory tax rate and the effective rate of the tax provision in 2017 and the tax benefit in 2016
was primarily due to state income taxes, particularly in the second quarter of 2017 when the Company received a state tax refund
of $17,000. The total tax effect of gross unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements at both October 31,
2016 and April 30, 2016 was $58,000, which, if recognized, would have an impact on the effective tax rate. The Company believes
it is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will not change in the next twelve months. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

The Company s primary sources of funding
for working capital requirements are cash flow from operations and existing cash balances. The Company s liquidity is affected
by many factors, including some that are based on normal operations and some that are related to the industries in which the Company
operates and the economy generally. Except as described below, there have been no material changes to the Company s liquidity
and capital resources as reflected in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2016 Form 10-K. 

Operating Activities  

Receivables, net decreased from $7,271,000
at April 30, 2016 to $6,950,000 at October 31, 2016, primarily due to accounts receivable collections in the Company s real
estate business. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased from $8,453,000 at April 30, 2016 to $7,578,000 at October 31,
2016, primarily due to lower business volumes and the timing of payments to vendors. 

Real estate inventory decreased from $61,663,000
at April 30, 2016 to $57,743,000 at October 31, 2016, due to real estate land sales. Investment assets decreased from $10,326,000
at April 30, 2016 to $9,716,000 at October 31, 2016, primarily due to the sale of a commercial retail property by a subsidiary
of AMREP Southwest. Property, plant and equipment decreased from $11,997,000 at April 30, 2016 to $11,337,000 at October 31, 2016,
primarily due to normal depreciation of fixed assets. 

Investing Activities  

Capital expenditures totaled $49,000 for the
first six months of 2017 and $271,000 for the same period of 2016, all for the Fulfillment Services business. 

Financing Activities  

AMREP Southwest has a loan from a company owned
by Nicholas G. Karabots, a significant shareholder of the Company and in which another director of the Company has a 20% participation.
The loan had an outstanding principal amount of $3,655,000 at October 31, 2016, is scheduled to mature on December 1, 2017, bears
interest payable monthly at 8.5% per annum, and is secured by a mortgage on all real property of AMREP Southwest in Rio Rancho
and by a pledge of the stock of its subsidiary, Outer Rim Investments, Inc. The total book value of the real property collateralizing
the loan was approximately $55,430,000 as of October 31, 2016. The loan may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty except
if the prepayment is in connection with the disposition of AMREP Southwest or substantially all of its assets. No payments of principal
are required until maturity, except that the following amounts are required to be applied to the payment of the loan: (a) 25% of
the net cash proceeds from any sales of real property by AMREP Southwest and (b) 25% of any royalty payments received by AMREP
Southwest under the oil and gas lease described in Note 8 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this
report on Form 10-Q. At October 31, 2016, AMREP Southwest was in compliance with the covenants of the loan. 

A subsidiary of AMREP Southwest had a loan
agreement with U.S. Bank National Association for the construction of a 2,200 square foot, single tenant retail building in Rio
Rancho, New Mexico. The loan was scheduled to mature on October 31, 2016, bore interest payable monthly on the outstanding principal
amount at 0.5% plus the prime rate, was secured by a mortgage on the real property of approximately one acre where construction
of the building had occurred, contained customary events of default, representations, warranties and covenants for a loan of this
nature and was guaranteed by AMREP Southwest. As of April 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of the loan was $555,000.
In the first quarter of 2017, this property was sold and the outstanding loan balance was satisfied with proceeds from the sale. 

Statement of Forward-Looking Information   

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995 (the  Act ) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. The
Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are  forward-looking , including
statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reports to the Company s
shareholders and news releases. All statements that express expectations, estimates, forecasts or projections are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Act. In addition, other written or oral statements, which constitute forward-looking statements,
may be made by or on behalf of the Company. Words such as  expects ,  anticipates ,  intends ,
 plans ,  believes ,  seeks ,  estimates ,  projects ,  forecasts ,
 may ,  should , variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and contingencies
that are difficult to predict. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document
incorporated by reference, the date of that document. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to
the Company or any person acting on behalf of the Company are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section. Many of the
factors that will determine the Company s future results are beyond the ability of management to control or predict. Therefore,
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such forward-looking
statements. 

The forward-looking statements contained in
this report include, but are not limited to, the loss of any material customer contract and the material adverse effect of any
such loss, the effect of recent accounting pronouncements on the Company, the timing of recognizing unrecognized compensation expense
related to shares of common stock issued under the 2006 Equity Plan, the timing of development of the Company s land held
for long-term investment, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits not changing in the next twelve months and the future business
conditions that may be experienced by the Company. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions
to any forward-looking statement to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of such forward-looking
statement, or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The Company s management, with the participation
of the Company s chief financial officer and the other person whose certification accompanies this quarterly report, has
evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. As a result of such evaluation, the chief financial officer
and such other person have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance
that the information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its chief financial officer
and such other person, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Company believes that a control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met,
and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company
have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

No change in the Company s system of
internal control over financial reporting occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
