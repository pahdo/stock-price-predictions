1.      Interim Financial Statements    
    
  Basis of Presentation.    The Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures as of   September 30, 2016  , and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are unaudited, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  The   December 31, 2015  , Consolidated Balance Sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. ).  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  In our opinion, these financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the results for the interim periods.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual Report for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed on Form 10-K with the SEC on February 22, 2016.  The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to  Amkor,   we,   us,   our  or the  company  are to Amkor Technology, Inc. and our subsidiaries. 
    
  On December 30, 2015, we increased our ownership in J-Devices to   100%   (  Note 3  ).  As a result, our accounting for J-Devices changed from the equity method to the consolidation method effective December 30, 2015.  The operating results of J-Devices were consolidated beginning in 2016. 
    
  Revision to Previously Reported Financial Information.    In the second quarter of 2016, we identified an error in the provision for income taxes in the financial statements for J-Devices for the periods beginning in 2012 through the fourth quarter of 2015.  We believe that the error is not material to Amkor for the periods impacted and have elected to revise our previously issued consolidated financial statements.  Periods presented herein are based on the revised financial results.  See   Note 17   for additional information. 
    
  Use of Estimates.    The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, using management s best estimates and judgments where appropriate.  These estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.  The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ materially from these estimates and judgments. 
    
  Goodwill.    The balance of goodwill in our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflects adjustments for foreign currency translation.  

2.      New Accounting Standards    
    
  Recently Adopted Standards 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  .  ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting (SEC Update)  , which clarifies that companies may continue to present unamortized debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements as an asset.  ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and require retrospective application.  We adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 on January 1, 2016.  The guidance was applied retrospectively and the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was adjusted to reclassify   $8.8 million   of debt issuance costs from other assets to a reduction in the carrying amount of the related debt liability.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  ASU 2016-09 involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.  We adopted ASU 2016-09 on July 1, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements or disclosure. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice in regard to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is applied retrospectively.  Early adoption is permitted.  We adopted ASU 2016-15 at September 30, 2016.  The guidance was applied retrospectively and the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was adjusted to reclassify   $7.0 million   of payments for debt retirement from operating activities to financing activities.  
    
  Recently Issued Standards 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.  ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017,   for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date  .  In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),   ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,   and ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , respectively, which provide supplemental guidance and clarification to ASU 2014-09.  Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and disclosure. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)  .  ASU 2015-11 requires inventory to be subsequently measured using the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby eliminating the market value approach.  Net realizable value is defined as the  estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.    ASU 2015-11 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is applied prospectively.  Early adoption is permitted.  ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements or disclosure.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  .  ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases.  Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability.  For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line lease expense.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and disclosure. 
    
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  .  ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.  This removes the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party.  ASU 2016-16 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 using a modified

retrospective approach.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our financial statements and disclosure.  

3.      Acquisition 
    
  Acquisition of J-Devices 
    
  Through the exercise of additional options, on December 30, 2015, we increased our ownership interest in J-Devices from   65.7%   to   100%   for a purchase price of   $105.4 million  .  As a result, our accounting for J-Devices changed from the equity method to the consolidation method effective December 30, 2015.  The operating results of J-Devices were consolidated beginning in 2016.  
    
  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we updated the purchase price allocation of J-Devices for a previously unrecognized tax provision liability at J-Devices of   $11.6 million  .  See Note 1 and 17 for additional information. 
    
  The following table presents the initial purchase price allocation and subsequent adjustments:

4.      Share-Based Compensation Plans    
    
  The following table summarizes our share-based compensation expense attributable to stock options and restricted shares: 

We recognized our share-based compensation costs primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses.  There were no corresponding deferred income tax benefits for stock options or restricted shares.  
    
  Stock Options 
    
  The following table summarizes our stock option activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

The following assumptions were used to calculate the weighted average fair values of the options granted: 

Total unrecognized compensation expense from stock options was   $2.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately   2.0 years   beginning   October 1, 2016  .

Restricted Shares 
    
  The following table summarizes our restricted share activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

Total unrecognized compensation cost from restricted shares was   $0.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   0.6 years   beginning   October 1, 2016  .   

5.        Other Income and Expense    
    
  Other income and expense consists of the following: 

6.      Income Taxes    
    
  Our income tax expense of   $29.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   primarily reflects income taxes at certain of our foreign operations and foreign withholding taxes.  Our income tax expense also reflects income taxed in foreign jurisdictions where we benefit from tax holidays. 
    
  We monitor on an ongoing basis our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and whether there is a need for a related valuation allowance.  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations.  For most of our foreign deferred tax assets, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize these deferred tax assets.  A significant amount of our net deferred tax assets relate to our operations in Korea. At this time, we consider it more likely than not we will have sufficient taxable income in the future that will allow us to realize these deferred tax assets.  However, it is possible that some or all of our Korean net operating loss carryforwards could ultimately expire unused, in the event future taxable income falls short of our current expectations.  If our assessment of the recoverability of Korean deferred tax assets changes in the future, we may need to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets.   
    
  We maintain a valuation allowance on all of our U.S. net deferred tax assets, including our net operating loss carryforwards.  Such valuation allowances are released as the related tax benefits are realized or when sufficient evidence exists to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.

Unrecognized tax benefits represent reserves for potential tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state or foreign tax audits.  Our gross unrecognized tax benefits increased from   $23.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  , to   $24.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Most of our unrecognized tax benefits would reduce our effective tax rate, if recognized.  Our unrecognized tax benefits are subject to change for effective settlement of examinations, changes in the recognition threshold of tax positions, the expiration of statues of limitations and other factors.  Tax return examinations involve uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that the outcome of examinations will be favorable.  

7.      Earnings Per Share    
    
  Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income attributable to Amkor common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  The weighted average number of common shares outstanding is reduced for treasury stock. 
    
  Diluted EPS is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and unvested restricted shares.  The following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted EPS:    

The following table summarizes the potential shares of common stock that were excluded from diluted EPS, because the effect of including these potential shares was anti-dilutive:

Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are included as a component of net periodic pension cost (  Note 14  ). 

9.      Factoring of Accounts Receivable    
    
  In certain foreign locations, we use non-recourse factoring arrangements with third party financial institutions to manage our working capital and cash flows.  Under this program, we sell receivables to a financial institution for cash at a discount to the face amount.  As part of the factoring arrangements, we perform certain collection and administrative functions for the receivables sold.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold accounts receivable totaling   $161.6 million   and   $431.8 million  , respectively, for a discount, plus fees, of   $0.8 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we sold accounts receivable totaling   $82.4 million   and   $235.3 million  , respectively, for a discount, plus fees, of   $0.3 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively.

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , construction in progress reflects   $365.8 million   and   $312.1 million  , respectively, of costs for K5, including capitalized interest of   $23.0 million   and   $18.7 million  , respectively.   
    
  As part of our plan to consolidate factory operations in Korea, we entered into an agreement in November 2016 to sell the land and buildings comprising our K1 factory for a purchase price of    162.1 billion   (approximately   $142 million  ).  We received   10%   of the purchase price at signing and the balance is due at closing.  The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2017 at which time we expect to recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately   $100 million  .

Our foreign debt is collateralized by land, buildings and equipment in the respective location.  The carrying value of the collateral exceeds the carrying amount of the debt. 
  The debt of Amkor Technology, Inc. is structurally subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.  The agreements governing our indebtedness contain a number of affirmative and negative covenants which restrict our ability to pay dividends and could restrict our operations.  We have never paid a dividend to our stockholders and we do not have any present plans for doing so.  We were in compliance with all of our covenants at   September 30, 2016  .

  Our subsidiaries in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan sponsor defined benefit pension plans.  Charges to expense are based upon actuarial analyses.  The components of net periodic pension cost for these defined benefit pension plans are as follows: 

As a result of the adoption of a defined benefit pension plan in Korea beginning on August 1, 2015, and the acquisition of J-Devices on December 30, 2015, our net periodic pension cost has increased from the prior period.

Defined Contribution Pension Plans 
    
  We sponsor defined contribution pension plans in Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and the U.S.  The following table summarizes our defined contribution expense: 

Korean Severance Plan 
    
  Our subsidiary in Korea maintains an unfunded severance plan that covers certain employees that were employed prior to August 1, 2015.  To the extent eligible employees are terminated, our subsidiary in Korea would be required to make lump-sum severance payments on behalf of these eligible employees for service provided prior to August 1, 2015.  Factors used to determine severance benefits include employees' length of service, seniority and rate of pay.  The employees' length of service and seniority are fixed as of July 31, 2015.  The employees' rate of pay is adjusted to the rate of pay at the time of termination.  Accrued severance benefits are estimated assuming all eligible employees were to terminate their employment at the balance sheet date.  Our contributions to the National Pension Plan of the Republic of Korea are deducted from accrued severance benefit liabilities.  The provision recorded for severance benefits for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $6.1 million   and   $7.0 million  , respectively.  The provision recorded for severance benefits for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $5.9 million   and   $20.7 million  , respectively.  On August 1, 2015, our subsidiary in Korea began sponsoring a defined benefit pension plan and a defined contribution plan.  Existing employees at that time were given the option of choosing either a defined benefit pension plan or a defined contribution plan for their future benefits and new employees since that date are enrolled in a defined contribution plan. 

15.      Fair Value Measurements    
    
  The accounting framework for determining fair value includes a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to measure fair value, which enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements.  The fair value hierarchy consists of three tiers as follows: Level 1, defined as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, defined as inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. 
    
  The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, capital expenditures payable, and certain other current assets and accrued expenses approximate carrying values because of their short-term nature.  The carrying value of certain other non-current liabilities approximates fair value.  Our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalent money market funds and restricted cash money market funds.  Cash equivalent money market funds and restricted cash money market funds are invested in U.S. money market funds and various U.S. and foreign bank operating and time deposit accounts, which are due on demand or carry a maturity date of less than three months when purchased.  No restrictions have been imposed on us regarding withdrawal of balances with respect to our cash equivalents as a result of liquidity or other credit market issues affecting the money market funds we invest in or the counterparty financial institutions holding our deposits.  Money market funds are valued using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets.

Our recurring fair value measurements consist of the following: 

We also measure certain assets and liabilities, including property, plant and equipment and goodwill, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
    
  We measure the fair value of our debt for disclosure purposes.  The following table presents the fair value of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The estimated fair value of our senior notes is based primarily on quoted market prices reported on or near the respective balance sheet dates.  The estimated fair value of our revolving credit facilities and term loans was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which utilized market based assumptions including forward interest rates adjusted for credit risk. 

16.      Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  We have a letter of credit sub-facility of   $25.0 million   under our $  200.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in December 2019.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $0.5 million   of standby letters of credit outstanding.  Such standby letters of credit are used in the ordinary course of our business and are collateralized by our cash balances. 
    
  We generally warrant that our services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and in compliance with our customers' specifications.  We accrue costs for known warranty issues.  Historically, our warranty costs have been immaterial. 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  We are involved in claims and legal proceedings and may become involved in other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of our business.  We evaluate these claims and legal matters on a case-by-case basis to make a determination as to the impact, if any, on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  Although the outcome of these matters is uncertain, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these claims and proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact to us.  Our evaluation of the potential impact of these claims and legal proceedings on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could change in the future. 
    
  In accordance with the accounting guidance for loss contingencies, including legal proceedings, lawsuits, pending claims and other legal matters, we accrue for a loss contingency when we conclude that the likelihood of a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  We adjust our accruals from time to time as we receive additional information, but the loss we incur may be significantly greater than or less than the amount we have accrued.  We disclose loss contingencies if we believe they are material and there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred.  Attorney fees related to legal matters are expensed as incurred.

17.  Revision of Previously Reported Financial Information 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, during our post-acquisition integration of J-Devices, we identified an error in the provision for income taxes in the financial statements for J-Devices for the periods beginning in 2012 through the fourth quarter of 2015.  During those periods we did not control J-Devices and, accordingly, we accounted for our investment in J-Devices using the equity method.  As a result of the J-Devices error, our equity in earnings of J-Devices was overstated by the cumulative amount of $  8.0 million  .  We believe that the error is not material to Amkor for the periods impacted and have elected to revise our previously issued consolidated financial statements.  We have also recorded the impact of the revision in our purchase accounting for the acquisition of J-Devices on December 30, 2015 (  Note 3  ).  Periods presented herein are based on the revised financial results. 
    
  The following table presents the effect of the aforementioned revisions on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   December 31, 2015  :

Item 2.           Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Amkor is one of the world s leading providers of outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services.  Our financial goals are sales growth and improved profitability, and we are focusing on the following strategies to achieve these goals: capitalizing on our investments in services for advanced technologies, improving utilization of existing assets and selectively growing our scale and scope through strategic investments. 
    
  We are an industry leader in developing and commercializing cost-effective advanced packaging and test technologies.  These advanced technology solutions provide increased value to our customers while typically generating gross margins above our corporate average.  This is particularly true in the mobile device market, where growth has outpaced the semiconductor industry rate.  Advanced packages are now the preferred choice in both the high-end and the mid-range segments of the smartphone market, which together account for a high portion of mobile phone semiconductor value.  The demand for advanced packages is also being driven by second-wave mobile device customers, who are transitioning out of wirebond into wafer-level and flip-chip packages.  We believe that our technology leadership and this technology transition create significant growth opportunities for us. 
    
  We typically look for opportunities in the advanced packaging and test area where we can generate reasonably quick returns on investments made for customers seeking leading edge technologies. We also focus on developing a second wave of customers to fill the capacity that becomes available when leading edge customers transition to newer packaging and test equipment and platforms.  For example, we are currently working to expand our sales to Chinese and Taiwanese fabless chip companies that make up a significant portion of the mid-tier and entry-level segments of the mobile device market where much of the growth is occurring.  In addition, we are seeking out new customers and deepening our engagement with existing customers. This includes an expanded emphasis on the automotive market where semiconductor content continues to grow and in the analog area for our mainstream wirebond technologies. 
    
  From time to time, we identify attractive opportunities to grow our customer base and expand the markets we serve.  For example, in 2009 we invested in J-Devices, a joint venture to provide semiconductor packaging and test services in Japan.  We increased our investment in J-Devices to 60% in 2013 and to 100% in 2015 through the exercise of additional options.  Also, in 2013, we acquired Toshiba s power discrete semiconductor packaging and test factory in Malaysia.  We believe that selective growth through joint ventures, acquisitions and other strategic investments can help diversify our revenue streams, improve our profits and continue our technological leadership. 
    
  Our IDM customers include: Intel Corporation; Renesas Electronics Corporation; STMicroelectronics N.V.; Texas Instruments Incorporated and Toshiba Corporation.  Our fabless customers include: Broadcom Limited and Qualcomm Incorporated.  Our contract foundry customers include: GlobalFoundries Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited. 
    
  Our business is impacted by market conditions in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and impacted by broad economic factors, such as world-wide gross domestic product and consumer spending.  Historical trends indicate there has been a strong correlation between world-wide gross domestic product levels, consumer spending and semiconductor industry cycles.  The semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged cyclical upturns and downturns in the past. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery. 
    
  Our net sales, gross profit, operating income, cash flows, liquidity and capital resources have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of many factors, including the seasonality of our business, the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  We operate in a capital intensive industry and have a significant level of debt.  Servicing our current and future customers requires that we incur significant operating expenses and continue to make significant capital expenditures, which are generally made in advance of the related revenues and without firm customer commitments.  We fund our operations, including capital expenditures and debt service requirements, with cash flows from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under available credit facilities and proceeds from any additional financing.  Maintaining an

     Table of Contents  

appropriate level of liquidity is important to our business and depends on, among other things, the performance of our business, our capital expenditure levels and our ability to repay debt out of our operating cash flows or proceeds from debt or equity financings. 
    
  Financial Highlights 
    
  On December 30, 2015, we increased our ownership in J-Devices to 100%.  As a result, our accounting for J-Devices changed from the equity method to the consolidation method.  Our operating results for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   include the fully consolidated results of J-Devices, whereas the comparable periods in 2015 include only our equity in earnings of J-Devices. 
    
  Our net sales increased   $351.7 million   or   47.9%   to   $1,086.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $734.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was primarily attributable to the consolidation of J-Devices.  J-Devices contributed   $257.1 million   of net sales in the current quarter.  Excluding J-Devices, net sales would have increased by   $94.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015 due to higher sales in the mobile communications market. 
    
  Gross profit for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   $87.2 million   over the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  J-Devices contributed   $41.7 million   in gross profit in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher net sales.    
    
  Our capital expenditures totaled   $481.7 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $352.6 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  We spent   $161.0 million   for construction of our K5 facility in Korea during the period, and the balance of our capital expenditures was primarily focused on investments in advanced packaging and test equipment. 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $491.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $430.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  J-Devices contributed $85.5 million of operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Excluding J-Devices, our operating cash flow decreased in 2016 primarily due to lower net sales, partially offset by interest savings associated with the June 2015 repayment of debt with proceeds from the issuance of lower cost debt.  

Results of Operations 
    
  The following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    In the second quarter of 2016, we identified an error in the provision for income taxes in the financial statements for J-Devices for the periods beginning in 2012 through the fourth quarter of 2015.  We have revised our previously issued consolidated financial statements to correct our equity in earnings for J-Devices during the impacted periods.  Please see Note 1 and Note 17 for additional information.

Net Sales 

The increase in net sales for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , was primarily attributable to the consolidation of J-Devices.  J-Devices contributed   $257.1 million   and $679.8 million of net sales for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Excluding J-Devices, net sales would have increased by   $94.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , driven by higher sales in the mobile communications market.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , excluding J-Devices, net sales would have been down by $21.7 million, primarily due to soft economic conditions as well as general weakness in the mobile communications market early in the year.  The decrease was partially offset by higher sales in the automotive market, which was driven by increased market share with existing customers and increasing semiconductor content in vehicles. 
    
  Gross Margin 

Our cost of sales consists principally of materials, labor, depreciation and manufacturing overhead.  Since a substantial portion of the costs at our factories is fixed, there tends to be a direct relationship between our revenue levels and gross margin where relatively modest increases or decreases can have a significant effect.  
    
  Gross profit for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the increase in net sales.  J-Devices contributed   $41.7 million   and $81.2 million in gross profit in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Gross margin increased for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Excluding J-Devices, gross margin would also have increased for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   due to higher net sales.  Gross margin decreased for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to the consolidation of J-Devices which has lower gross margin. 
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  J-Devices accounted for $14.5 million and $42.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Excluding J-Devices, selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   would also have increased primarily due to higher employee incentive compensation costs, partially offset by general cost savings, as well as lower depreciation expense and contracted services.  

-   23  - 

     Table of Contents  

Research and Development 

Research and development activities are focused on developing new packaging and test services and improving the efficiency and capabilities of our existing production processes.  The costs related to our technology and product development projects are included in research and development expense until the project moves into production. Once production begins, the costs related to production become part of the cost of sales, including ongoing depreciation for the equipment previously held for research and development activities.  Research and development expenses increased in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  J-Devices added $4.2 million and $12.8 million in research and development expenses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Excluding J-Devices, research and development expenses would also have increased due to an increase in development activities and the related employee compensation costs and depreciation resulting from continued investments in equipment.  The increase was partially offset by the reduction in costs for projects that moved into production. 
    
  Other Income and Expense 

Interest expense increased for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015, as we are no longer capitalizing interest in connection with the construction of K5 which was completed in the first quarter of 2016.  Interest expense decreased for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The decrease was primarily driven by the repayment in full of our 7.375% Senior Notes due May 2018 with proceeds from lower cost debt in June 2015.  The early repayment of the Senior Notes resulted in a loss on debt retirement of $8.9 million included in other (income) expense, net for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , foreign currency (gain) loss, net was a loss as compared with a gain in the prior year periods.  The change primarily resulted from unfavorable exchange rate movements and the associated impact on our net monetary exposure at our foreign subsidiaries. 
    
  Income Tax Expense 

Generally, our annual effective tax rate is below the U.S. federal tax rate of 35% because the majority of our income is taxed in foreign jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region, where we benefit from tax holidays or tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate.  Foreign withholding taxes and minimum taxes generally cause our effective tax rate to increase.  

-   24  - 

     Table of Contents  

Our income tax expense reflects the applicable tax rates in effect in the various countries in which our income is earned and is subject to volatility depending on the relative jurisdictional mix of earnings.  During   2016   and   2015  , our subsidiaries in Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan operated under tax holidays which will continue to expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2024.  We expect our effective tax rate to increase as the tax holidays expire because income earned in these jurisdictions will be subject to higher statutory income tax rates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We assess our liquidity based on our current expectations regarding sales, operating expenses, capital spending, debt service requirements and other funding needs.  Based on this assessment, we believe that our cash flow from operating activities, together with existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and other financial requirements for at least the next twelve months.  Our liquidity is affected by, among other things, volatility in the global economy and credit markets, the performance of our business, our capital expenditure levels, other uses of our cash including any purchases of stock under our stock repurchase program, any acquisitions or investments in joint ventures and our ability to either repay debt out of operating cash flow or refinance it at or prior to maturity with the proceeds of debt or equity offerings.       There can be no assurance that we will generate the necessary net income or operating cash flows, or be able to borrow sufficient funds, to meet the funding needs of our business beyond the next twelve months due to a variety of factors, including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Our primary source of cash and the source of funds for our operations are cash flows from operations, current cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under available credit facilities and proceeds from any additional debt or equity financings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $549.8 million  .  Included in our cash balance as of   September 30, 2016  , is   $348.9 million   held offshore by our foreign subsidiaries.  If we were to distribute this offshore cash to the U.S. as dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, in some cases we would incur foreign withholding taxes; however, we would not incur a significant amount of U.S. federal income taxes due to the availability of tax loss carryovers and foreign tax credits.  In addition to dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, we have other options available to access cash held offshore by our foreign subsidiaries, including the settlement of intercompany debt facilities.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had availability of   $99.5 million   under our   $200.0 million   first lien senior secured revolving credit facility.  In October 2016, we repaid $40.0 million of the outstanding balance and our availability was increased accordingly.  Our foreign subsidiaries had   $119.0 million   available to be drawn under secured revolving credit facilities and   $77.5 million   available to be borrowed under secured term loan credit facilities for working capital purposes and capital expenditures.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   we had   $1,579.0 million   of debt.  Our scheduled principal repayments on debt include   $18.6 million   due in 2016,   $16.0 million   due in 2017,   $127.5 million   due in 2018,   $250.0 million   due in 2019,   $245.0 million   due in 2020 and   $925.0 million   due thereafter.  We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at   September 30, 2016  , and we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants for at least the next twelve months. 
    
  In certain foreign locations, we use non-recourse factoring arrangements with third party financial institutions to manage our working capital and cash flows.  Under this program, we sell receivables to a financial institution for cash at a discount to the face amount.  Available capacity under these programs is dependent on the level of our trade accounts receivable eligible to be sold, the financial institutions' willingness to purchase such receivables and the limits provided by the financial institutions.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we sold accounts receivable totaling   $431.8 million   and   $235.3 million  , respectively, for a discount, plus fees, of   $1.7 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were outstanding receivables of   $160.0 million   and   $141.9 million  , respectively, which had been sold to financial institutions under these arrangements.   
    
  In order to reduce our debt and future cash interest payments, we may from time to time repurchase our outstanding notes for cash or exchange shares of our common stock for our outstanding notes.  Any such transaction may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise and is subject to the terms of our indentures and other debt agreements, market conditions and other factors.

Certain debt agreements have restrictions on dividend payments and the repurchase of stock and subordinated securities.  These restrictions are determined in part by calculations based upon cumulative net income.  We have never paid a dividend to our stockholders and we do not have any present plans for doing so.  From time to time, Amkor Technology, Inc. also guarantees certain debt of our subsidiaries. 
    
  Our subsidiary in Korea maintains an unfunded severance plan that covers certain employees that were employed prior to August 1, 2015.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the severance liability was   $152.8 million  .  For service periods subsequent to August 1, 2015, employees participate in either a defined benefit pension plan or a defined contribution pension plan. 
    
  In January 2015, we settled our patent license litigation with Tessera. Under the terms of the settlement, Amkor agreed to pay Tessera a total of $155.0 million in 16 equal quarterly recurring payments commencing in the first quarter of 2015 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2018.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owe   $87.2 million   to Tessera. 
    
  In April 2016, our Kumamoto factory was damaged by the earthquakes in Japan.  Production was restored at Kumamoto in the second quarter, and our sales in the second quarter were reduced by approximately $15 million due to the temporary disruption in operations. We incurred   $16.4 million   of earthquake related costs in the second and third quarters for damaged inventory, buildings and equipment.  Taking into account estimated insurance payments of  3 billion, approximately $30 million, anticipated to be received later this year, we expect the net impact on our liquidity to be minimal. 
    
  We operate in a capital intensive industry.  Servicing our current and future customers may require that we incur significant operating expenses and make significant investments in equipment and facilities, which are generally made in advance of the related revenues and without firm customer commitments.   
    
  Our Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to   $300.0 million   of our common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses.  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $91.6 million   was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program.  The purchase of stock may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.  The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us at our discretion and will depend upon a variety of factors including economic and market conditions, the cash needs and investment opportunities for the business, the current market price of our stock, applicable legal requirements and other factors.  We have not purchased any stock under the plan since 2012. 

Investments 
    
  We make significant capital expenditures in order to service the demand of our customers, which is primarily focused on investments in advanced packaging and test equipment.  We expect that our   2016   capital expenditures will be approximately   $650 million  , including approximately   $170 million   of spending on our new K5 factory in Korea.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our capital expenditures totaled   $481.7 million  , including   $161.0 million   for K5.  Ultimately, the amount of our   2016   capital expenditures will depend on several factors including, among others, the timing and implementation of any capital projects under review, the performance of our business, economic and market conditions, the cash needs and investment opportunities for the business, the need for additional capacity to service anticipated customer demand and the availability of cash flows from operations or financing. 
    
  In addition, we are subject to risks associated with our capital expenditures, including those discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "  Capital Expenditures - We Make Substantial Investments in Equipment and Facilities To Support the Demand Of Our Customers, Which May Adversely Affect Our Business If the Demand Of Our Customers Does Not Develop As We Expect or Is Adversely Affected.

Cash Flows 
    
  Net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were as follows: 

Operating activities:     Our cash flows   provided by   operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   increased   by   $61.2 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .    J-Devices contributed $85.5 million of operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Excluding J-Devices, our operating cash flow decreased in 2016 primarily due to lower net sales, partially offset by interest savings associated with the June 2015 repayment of our 7.375% Senior Notes due May 2018 with proceeds from the issuance of lower cost debt. 
    
  Investing activities:     Our cash flows   used in   investing activities are principally for payments for property, plant and equipment, which increased compared to the prior year primarily due to payments for the construction of K5 and capital expenditures at J-Devices, our newly consolidated subsidiary.  The net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , included a payment for an incremental investment in J-Devices, partially offset by the receipt of the final payment for the sale of our subsidiary to J-Devices.  
    
  Financing activities:     The net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was driven by net repayments at our subsidiaries in Japan, Korea and Taiwan.  The net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily resulted from the repayment of our 7.375% Senior Notes due May 2018 and other borrowings, partially offset by new borrowings.  
    
  We provide the following supplemental data to assist our investors and analysts in understanding our liquidity and capital resources.  We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less payments for property, plant and equipment, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.  Free cash flow is not defined by U.S. GAAP.  We believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful information to our investors because it provides them with additional information in assessing our liquidity, capital resources and financial operating results.  Our management uses free cash flow in evaluating our liquidity, our ability to service debt and our ability to fund capital expenditures.  However, free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other, non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service, are not deducted from the measure.  The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods.  This measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of liquidity or financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as net cash provided by operating activities.  Furthermore, our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at   September 30, 2016  , and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. 

(1) 
    Scheduled interest payment obligations were calculated using stated coupon rates for fixed rate debt and interest rates applicable at   September 30, 2016  , for variable rate debt. 
              (2) 
    Represents off-balance sheet purchase obligations for capital expenditures and long-term supply contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
              (3) 
    Represents estimated benefit payments for our Korean subsidiary severance plan. 
              (4) 
    Represents settlement payments for patent license litigation. At   September 30, 2016  , the total obligation is   $87.2 million   of which   $34.7 million   is a current liability,   $46.8 million   is a non-current liability and   $5.7 million   will be imputed into interest over time. 
     In addition to the obligations identified in the table above, other non-current liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016  , include: 
             
    $50.4 million   of net foreign pension plan obligations, for which the timing and actual amount of impact on our future cash flow is uncertain.   
                
    $22.5 million   net liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits.  Due to the uncertainty regarding the amount and the timing of any future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period of ultimate settlement, if any, with the various taxing authorities. 
     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet guarantees or other off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 
    
  Contingencies, Indemnifications and Guarantees 
    
  We refer you to   Note 16   to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of our contingencies related to litigation and other legal matters.  The potential impact from legal proceedings on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could change in the future. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 3.          Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Market Risk Sensitivity 
    
  We are exposed to market risks, primarily related to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.  In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in interest rates.  Our use of derivative instruments, including forward exchange contracts, has been historically insignificant; however, we continue to evaluate the use of hedging instruments to manage currency and other risks.   
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 

In order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency gains and losses, we generally use natural hedging techniques to reduce foreign currency rate risk.  The U.S. dollar is our reporting and functional currency and the functional currency for our subsidiaries, except for J-Devices, where the Japanese Yen is the functional currency. 
    
  We have foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  We performed a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency exposure as of   September 30, 2016  , to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates for all foreign denominated assets and liabilities.  Assuming a 10% adverse movement for all currencies as of   September 30, 2016  , our income before taxes would have been approximately $28 million lower, due to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities.  We have a significant net monetary liability at our subsidiary in Korea, principally driven by our Korean severance plan. 
    
  In addition, we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure on our results of operations.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , approximately 72% of our net sales were denominated in U.S. dollars.  Our remaining net sales were principally denominated in Japanese Yen for local country sales.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , approximately 50% of our cost of sales and operating expenses were denominated in U.S. dollars and were largely for raw materials and depreciation.  The remaining portion of our cost of sales and operating expenses was principally denominated in the Asian currencies where our production facilities are located and largely consisted of labor.  To the extent that the U.S. dollar weakens against these Asian-based currencies, similar foreign currency denominated income and expenses in the future will result in higher sales, higher cost of sales and operating expenses, with cost of sales and operating expenses having the greater impact on our financial results.  Similarly, our sales, cost of sales and operating expenses will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies.  We performed a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency exposure as of   September 30, 2016  , to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates for all foreign denominated sales and expenses.  Assuming a 10% adverse movement in our currency exposures, our operating income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   would have been approximately $61 million lower due to this exposure. 
    
  There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements across multiple jurisdictions would change instantaneously in an equally adverse fashion.  As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market or other changes that could arise which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations. 
    
  Our Consolidated Financial Statements are impacted by changes in exchange rates at entities where the local currency is the functional currency.  The effect of foreign exchange rate translation for these entities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was a net foreign translation gain of   $52.2 million   and $0.3 million, respectively, and was recognized as an adjustment to equity through other comprehensive   income  .

Interest Rate Risk  
    
  We have interest rate risk with respect to our debt.  Our fixed and variable rate debt includes foreign borrowings and revolving credit facilities.  Our fixed rate debt also consists of senior notes.  Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio.  A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value of the debt instrument but has no impact on interest expense or cash flows.  A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not generally impact the fair value of the instrument.   
    
  The table below presents the interest rates, maturities and fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt as of   September 30, 2016  : 

For information regarding the fair value of our long-term debt, see   Note 15   to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 4.          Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, based on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures.  
    
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , and concluded those disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
    
  On December 30, 2015, we obtained control of J-Devices and changed our accounting for J-Devices to the consolidation method.  Prior to December 30, 2015, we accounted for J-Devices as an equity method investment and maintained adequate internal control over financial reporting relating to our investment.  We are integrating the acquired operations into our overall internal control over financial reporting.  
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.          Legal Proceedings 
    
  Information about legal proceedings is set forth in   Note 16   to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 1A.       Risk Factors 
    
  The factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.  For more information regarding the forward-looking statements contained in this report, see the Table of Contents of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Amkor.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also impair our business operations.  The occurrence of any of the following risks could affect our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
    
  Dependence on the Highly Cyclical Semiconductor Industry - We Operate in Volatile Industries and Industry Downturns and Declines in Global Economic and Financial Conditions Could Harm Our Performance.  
    
  Our business is impacted by market conditions in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical by nature and impacted by broad economic factors, such as world-wide gross domestic product and consumer spending.  The semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes sudden and prolonged downturns in the past.  For example, the financial crisis and global recession in 2008 and 2009 resulted in a downturn in the semiconductor industry that adversely affected our business and results of operations during those periods.  The economic recovery since that time has been slow and uneven. 
    
  Since our business is, and will continue to be, dependent on the requirements of semiconductor companies for outsourced packaging and test services, any downturn in the semiconductor industry or any other industry that uses a significant number of semiconductor devices, such as telecommunications, consumer electronics, or computing, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.  During downturns we have experienced, among other things, reduced demand, excess capacity and reduced sales.  For example, generally soft economic conditions and a lack of compelling new mobile products constrained overall demand during 2015. Macroeconomic uncertainties and a cautious business climate are also expected to constrain the revenue growth in our business.  It is difficult to predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, which, in turn, makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results, make business decisions and identify risks that may affect our business, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, if industry conditions deteriorate, we could suffer significant losses, as we have in the past, which could materially impact our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
    
  Fluctuations in Operating Results and Cash Flows - Our Operating Results and Cash Flows Have Varied and May Vary Significantly as a Result of Factors That We Cannot Control  . 
    
  Many factors, including the impact of adverse economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, gross profit, operating results and cash flows, or lead to significant variability of quarterly or annual operating results.  Our profitability and ability to generate cash from operations is principally dependent upon demand for semiconductors, the utilization of our capacity, semiconductor package mix, the average selling price of our services, our ability to manage our capital expenditures and our ability to control our costs including labor, material, overhead and financing costs. 
    
  Our net sales, gross profit, operating income and cash flows have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of many of the following factors, over which we have little or no control and which we expect to continue to impact our business: 
             
    fluctuation in demand for semiconductors and conditions in the semiconductor industry generally, as well as by specific customers, such as inventory reductions by our customers impacting demand in key markets;

     Table of Contents  

our ability to achieve our major growth objectives, including: transitioning second-wave customers to advanced packages; expanding our sales to customers in Greater China and, in particular, the mid-level and entry-level tiers of the mobile device market; and increasing our share of the automotive market; 
                
    changes in our capacity and capacity utilization rates; 
                
    changes in average selling prices which can occur quickly due to the absence of long term agreements on price; 
                
    changes in the mix of the semiconductor packaging and test services that we sell; 
                
    the development, transition and ramp to high volume manufacture of more advanced silicon nodes and evolving wafer, packaging and test technologies, may cause production delays, lower manufacturing yields and supply constraints for new wafers and other materials; 
                
    absence of backlog, the short-term nature of our customers  commitments, double bookings by customers and deterioration in customer forecasts and the impact of these factors, including the possible delay, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders, or the timing and volume of orders relative to our production capacity; 
                
    changes in costs, quality, availability and delivery times of raw materials, components and equipment; 
                
    changes in labor costs to perform our services; 
                
    wage inflation and fluctuations in commodity prices, including gold, copper and other precious metals; 
                
    the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders; 
                
    changes in effective tax rates; 
                
    the availability and cost of financing; 
                
    intellectual property transactions and disputes; 
                
    high leverage and restrictive covenants; 
                
    warranty and product liability claims and the impact of quality excursions and customer disputes and returns; 
                
    costs associated with legal claims, indemnification obligations, judgments and settlements; 
                
    international events, such as the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union, political instability, civil disturbances or environmental or natural events, such as earthquakes like the recent ones in Japan, that impact our operations; 
                
    pandemic illnesses that may impact our labor force and our ability to travel; 
                
    costs of acquisitions and divestitures and difficulties integrating acquisitions; 
                
    our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to support our global operations; 
                
    fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; 
                
    fluctuations in our manufacturing yields; 
                
    our ability to penetrate new end markets or expand our business in existing end markets; 
                
    dependence on key customers or concentration of customers in certain end markets, such as mobile communications and automotive and 
                
    restructuring charges, asset write-offs and impairments. 
       
  It is often difficult to predict the impact of these factors upon our results for a particular period.  The downturn in the global economy and the semiconductor industry in 2009 increased the risks associated with the foregoing factors as customer  

-   32  - 

     Table of Contents  

forecasts became more volatile, and there was less visibility regarding future demand and significantly increased uncertainty regarding the economy, credit markets and consumer demand.  The slow rate of economic growth in the U.S. and elsewhere and economic uncertainty worldwide could continue to cause volatility in customer forecasts and reduce our visibility regarding future demand in the semiconductor industry.  These factors may have a material and adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or lead to significant variability of quarterly or annual operating results.  In addition, these factors may adversely affect our credit ratings which could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise capital and could adversely affect the price of our securities. 
    
  Absence of Backlog - The Lack of Contractually Committed Customer Demand May Adversely Affect Our Sales. 
    
  Our packaging and test business does not typically operate with any material backlog.  Our quarterly net sales from packaging and test services are substantially dependent upon our customers  demand in that quarter.  None of our customers have committed to purchase any significant amount of packaging or test services or to provide us with binding forecasts of demand for packaging and test services for any future period, in any material amount.  In addition, we sometimes experience double booking by customers and our customers often reduce, cancel or delay their purchases of packaging and test services for a variety of reasons including industry-wide, customer-specific and Amkor-specific reasons.  This makes it difficult for us to forecast our capacity utilization and net sales in future periods.  Since a large portion of our costs is fixed and our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future sales, we may not be able to adjust costs in a timely manner to compensate for any sales shortfall.  If we are unable to adjust costs in a timely manner, our margins, operating results, financial condition and cash flows would be adversely affected. 
    
  High Fixed Costs - Due to Our High Percentage of Fixed Costs, We Will Be Unable to Maintain Satisfactory Gross Margins if We Are Unable to Achieve Relatively High Capacity Utilization Rates. 
    
  Our operations are characterized by relatively high fixed costs.  Our profitability depends in part not only on pricing levels for our packaging and test services, but also on the efficient utilization of our human resources and packaging and test equipment.  Increases or decreases in our capacity utilization can significantly affect gross margins.  In periods of low demand, we experience relatively low capacity utilization in our operations, which leads to reduced margins during that period.  Transitions between different packaging technologies, such as the transition from gold wirebond to flip chip and copper wirebond packages, can also impact our capacity utilization if we do not efficiently redeploy our equipment for other packaging and test opportunities.  For example, in 2011 the migration of some customer demand from wirebond to flip chip packages resulted in under-utilized wirebond assets which negatively impacted our capacity utilization and gross margin.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve consistently high capacity utilization, and if we fail to do so, our gross margins will be negatively impacted.  If our gross margins decrease, our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
    
  In addition, our fixed operating costs have increased in recent years in part as a result of our efforts to expand our capacity through significant capital expenditures.  Forecasted customer demand for which we have made capital investments may not materialize, especially if industry conditions deteriorate.  As a result, our sales may not adequately cover fixed costs resulting in reduced profit levels or causing significant losses, both of which may adversely impact our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
    
  Guidance - Our Failure to Meet Our Guidance or Analyst Projections Could Adversely Impact the Trading Prices of Our Securities. 
    
  We periodically provide guidance to investors with respect to certain financial information for future periods.  Securities analysts also periodically publish their own projections with respect to our future operating results.  As discussed above under    Fluctuations in Operating Results and Cash Flows - Our Operating Results and Cash Flows Have Varied and May Vary Significantly as a Result of Factors That We Cannot Control  ,  our operating results and cash flows vary significantly and are difficult to accurately predict.  Volatility in customer forecasts and fluctuations in global consumer demand make it particularly difficult to predict future results.  To the extent we fail to meet or exceed our own guidance or the analyst projections for any reason, the trading prices of our securities may be adversely impacted.  Moreover, even if we do meet or exceed that guidance or those projections, if analysts and investors do not react favorably, or if analysts were to discontinue providing coverage of our company, the trading prices of our securities may be adversely impacted.

Declining Average Selling Prices - Historically There Has Been Downward Pressure on the Prices of Our Packaging and Test Services. 
    
  Prices for packaging and test services have generally declined over time, and sometimes prices can change significantly in relatively short periods of time.  We expect downward pressure on average selling prices for our packaging and test services to continue in the future, and this pressure may intensify during downturns in business.  If we are unable to offset a decline in average selling prices by developing and marketing new packages with higher prices, reducing our purchasing costs, recovering more of our material cost increases from our customers and reducing our manufacturing costs, our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
    
  Decisions by Our Integrated Device Manufacturer and Foundry Customers to Curtail Outsourcing May Adversely Affect Our Business. 
    
  Historically, we have been dependent on the trend in outsourcing of packaging and test services by IDM customers.  Our IDM and foundry customers continually evaluate the need for outsourced services against their own in-house packaging and test services.  As a result, at any time and for a variety of reasons, IDMs and foundries may decide to shift some or all of their outsourced packaging and test services to internally sourced capacity. 
    
  The reasons IDMs and foundries may shift their outsourced business to internal capacity include: 
             
    their desire to realize higher utilization of their existing packaging and test capacity, especially during downturns in the semiconductor industry; 
                
    their unwillingness to disclose proprietary technology; 
                
    their possession of more advanced packaging and test technologies and 
                
    the guaranteed availability of their own packaging and test capacity. 
     In addition, to the extent we limit capacity commitments for certain customers, these customers may increase their level of in-house packaging and test capabilities, which could make it more difficult for us to regain their business when we have available capacity. 
    
  In a downturn in the semiconductor industry, IDMs and foundries could respond by shifting some or all outsourced packaging and test services to internally serviced capacity on a short term basis.  Also, the IDMs and foundries could curtail or reverse the trend of outsourcing packaging and test services.  If we experience a significant loss of IDM or foundry business, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, especially during a prolonged industry downturn. 
    
  Our Substantial Indebtedness Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Prevent Us from Fulfilling Our Obligations. 
    
  We have a significant amount of indebtedness, and the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness allow us and our subsidiaries to incur more debt, subject to certain limitations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total debt balance was   $1,579.0 million  , of which   $30.8 million   was classified as a current liability and   $532.8 million   was collateralized indebtedness at our subsidiaries.  We may consider investments in joint ventures, increased capital expenditures or acquisitions which may increase our indebtedness.  If new debt is added to our consolidated debt level, the related risks that we face could intensify.  
    
  Our substantial indebtedness could: 
             
    make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including our obligations under our indentures to purchase notes tendered as a result of a change in control of Amkor; 
                
    increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

    increase our cost of borrowing. 
     We May Have Difficulty Funding Liquidity Needs. 
    
  We assess our liquidity based on our current expectations regarding sales, operating expenses, capital spending and debt service requirements and other funding needs.  Our liquidity is affected by, among other things, the performance of our business, our capital expenditure and other investment levels and our ability to repay debt and other long-term obligations out of our operating cash flows or with the proceeds of debt or equity financings. 
    
  We operate in a capital intensive industry.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had capital expenditures of   $481.7 million  .  Servicing our current and future customers requires that we incur significant operating expenses and continue to make significant capital expenditures and other investments, which are generally made in advance of the related revenues and without firm customer commitments.  Ultimately the actual amount of our capital expenditures for 2016 and thereafter may vary materially and will depend on several factors.  These factors include, among others, the amount, timing and implementation of our capital projects, including those under review and those not yet planned, the performance of our business, economic and market conditions, the cash needs and investment opportunities for the business, the need for additional capacity and facilities and the availability of cash flows from operations or financing. 
    
  In addition, we have a significant level of debt, which requires significant scheduled principal and interest payments in the coming years.  The sources funding our operations, including making capital expenditures and other investments and servicing principal and interest obligations with respect to our debt, are cash flows from our operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under available debt facilities, or proceeds from any additional debt or equity financing. 
    
  The health of the worldwide banking system and capital markets affects our liquidity.  If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the U.S., foreign or international banking system and capital markets, they may refuse or be unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us.  Volatility in the banking system and capital markets could also make it difficult or more expensive for us to maintain our existing credit facilities or refinance our debt. 
    
  The trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations.  Such fluctuations could impact our decision or ability to utilize the equity markets as a potential source of our funding needs in the future. 
    
  In addition, there is a risk that we could fail to generate the necessary net income or operating cash flows to meet the funding needs of our business due to a variety of factors, including the other factors discussed in this  Risk Factors  section.  If we fail to generate the necessary cash flows or we are unable to access the capital markets when needed, our liquidity may be adversely impacted.

Restrictive Covenants in the Indentures and Agreements Governing Our Current and Future Indebtedness. 
    
  The indentures and agreements governing our existing debt, and debt we may incur in the future, contain, or may contain, affirmative and negative covenants that materially limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock, make certain investments and other payments, enter into certain mergers and consolidations, engage in sale leaseback transactions and encumber and dispose of assets.  In addition, our future debt agreements may contain financial covenants and ratios. 
    
  The breach of any of these covenants by us or the failure by us to meet any of the financial ratios or conditions could result in a default under any or all of such indebtedness.  If a default occurs under any such indebtedness, all of the outstanding obligations thereunder could become immediately due and payable, which could result in a default under our other outstanding debt and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to other outstanding debt.  The existence of such a default or event of default could also preclude us from borrowing funds under our revolving credit facilities.  Our ability to comply with the provisions of the indentures, credit facilities and other agreements governing our outstanding debt and indebtedness we may incur in the future can be affected by events beyond our control and a default under any debt instrument, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. 
    
  We Have Significant Severance Plan Obligations Associated With Our Manufacturing Operations in Korea Which Could Reduce Our Cash Flow and Negatively Impact Our Financial Condition. 
    
  Our subsidiary in Korea maintains an unfunded severance plan, under which we have an accrued liability of   $152.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The plan covers certain employees that were employed prior to August 1, 2015.  In the event of a significant layoff or other reduction in our labor force in Korea, our subsidiary in Korea would be required to make lump-sum severance payments under the plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows.  
    
  If We Fail to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Controls, We May Not be Able to Accurately Report Financial Results or Prevent Fraud. 
    
  Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud.  We must annually evaluate our internal procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires management and our independent registered public accounting firm to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Internal controls may not prevent or detect misstatements because of their inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, fraud or corruption.  Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
    
  We assess our internal controls and systems on an ongoing basis, and from time-to-time, we update and make modifications to our global enterprise resource planning system.  We have implemented several significant enterprise resource planning modules and expect to implement additional enterprise resource planning modules in the future.  In addition, we have implemented new shop floor management systems in certain of our factories and integrated the acquired operations of Amkor Technology Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. into our overall internal control over financial reporting.  In December 2015, we acquired the operations of J-Devices, and we are integrating those operations into our overall internal control over financial reporting.   Although we continue to monitor and assess our internal controls for these systems and operations, there is a risk that deficiencies may occur that could constitute significant deficiencies or, in the aggregate, a material weakness. 
    
  If we fail to remedy any deficiencies or maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation.  In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our operating results or financial condition.

We Face Warranty Claims, Product Return and Liability Risks, the Risk of Economic Damage Claims and the Risk of Negative Publicity if Our Packages Fail  . 
    
  Our packages are incorporated into a number of end products, and our business is exposed to warranty claims, product return and liability risks, the risk of economic damage claims and the risk of negative publicity if our packages fail.  
    
  We receive warranty claims from our customers which occur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.  If we were to experience an unusually high incidence of warranty claims, we could incur significant costs and our business could be adversely affected.  In addition, we are exposed to the product and economic liability risks and the risk of negative publicity affecting our customers.  Our sales may decline if any of our customers are sued on a product liability claim.  We also may suffer a decline in sales from the negative publicity associated with such a lawsuit or with adverse public perceptions in general regarding our customers' products.  Further, if our packages are delivered with defects, we could incur additional development, repair or replacement costs or suffer other economic losses, and our credibility and the market's acceptance of our packages could be harmed. 
    
  Risks Associated With International Operations - We Depend on Our Factories and Operations in China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan.  Many of Our Customers' and Vendors' Operations Are Also Located Outside of the U.S. 
    
  We provide packaging and test services through our factories and other operations located in China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan.  Substantially all of our property, plant and equipment is located outside of the United States.  Moreover, many of our customers and the vendors in our supply chain are located outside the U.S.  The following are some of the risks we face in doing business internationally: 
             
    changes in consumer demand resulting from deteriorating conditions in local economies; 
                
    regulations and policies imposed by U.S. or foreign governments, such as tariffs, customs, duties and other restrictive trade barriers, antitrust and competition, tax, currency and banking, privacy, labor, environmental, health and safety; 
                
    laws, rules, regulations and policies within China and other countries that may favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors; 
                
    the payment of dividends and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to prohibitions, limitations or taxes in local jurisdictions; 
                
    fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly with the recent acquisition of J-Devices; 
                
    political and social conditions, such as civil unrest and terrorism; 
                
    disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs brokers or government agencies; 
                
    difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel and managing foreign operations, including foreign labor disruptions; 
                
    difficulty in enforcing contractual rights and protecting our intellectual property rights; 
                
    potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from tax laws in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and 
                
    local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations. 
     In particular, we have significant facilities and other investments in South Korea, and there have been heightened security concerns in recent years stemming from North Korea s nuclear weapon and long-range missile programs as well as its military actions in the region.  Furthermore, there has been a history of conflict and a recent rise in tensions among other countries in the region.

We Face Risks in Connection with the Continuing Development and Implementation of Changes to, and Maintenance and Security of, Our Management Information Systems. 
    
  We depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business.  Some of our key software has been developed by our own programmers, and this software may not be easily integrated with other software and systems.  Our systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading, replacing or maintaining software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, malfeasance or catastrophic events.  In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  From time to time we make additions or changes to our management information systems.  For example, we have implemented new shop floor systems in certain of our factories, and we are integrating J-Devices' management information systems with our existing systems and processes.  We face risks in connection with current and future projects to install or integrate new management information systems or upgrade our existing systems.  These risks include: 
             
    we may face delays in the design and implementation of the system; 
                
    the cost of the systems may exceed our plans and expectations and 
                
    disruptions resulting from the implementation or integration of the systems may impact our ability to process transactions and delay shipments to customers, impact our results of operations or financial condition or harm our control environment. 
     Our business could be materially and adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to successfully install new systems or improve, upgrade, integrate or expand upon our existing systems. 
    
  We Face Risks Trying to Attract and Retain Qualified Employees to Support Our Operations. 
    
  Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior management, sales and technical personnel, any of whom may be difficult to replace.  Competition for qualified employees is intense, and our business could be adversely affected by the loss of the services of any of our existing key personnel, including senior management, as a result of competition or for any other reason.  We do not have employment agreements with our key employees, including senior management or other contracts that would prevent our key employees from working for our competitors in the event they cease working for us.  We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to retain key employees or in hiring and properly training sufficient numbers of qualified personnel and in effectively managing our growth.  Our inability to attract, retain, motivate and train qualified new personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
    
  Difficulties Consolidating and Integrating Our Operations - We Face Challenges as We Integrate Diverse Operations. 
    
  We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, change in the scope and complexity of our operations resulting primarily from existing and future facility consolidations, strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and other partnering arrangements.  Some of the risks from these activities include those associated with the following: 
             
    increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;  
                
    conforming an acquired company's standards, practices, systems and controls with our operations; 
                
    increasing complexity from combining recent acquisitions of an acquired business; 
                
    unexpected losses of key employees or customers of an acquired business; other difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products and 
                
    diversion of management and other resources from other parts of our operations and adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers. 
     In connection with these activities, we may: 
             
    use a significant portion of our available cash; 

-   38  - 

     Table of Contents  

issue equity securities, which may dilute the ownership of current stockholders; 
                
    incur substantial debt; 
                
    incur or assume known or unknown contingent liabilities and 
                
    incur large, immediate accounting write offs and face antitrust or other regulatory inquiries or actions. 
     For example, the businesses we have acquired had, at the time of acquisition, multiple systems for managing their own production, sales, inventory and other operations.  Migrating these businesses to our systems typically is a slow, expensive process requiring us to divert significant resources from other parts of our operations.  We may continue to face these challenges in the future.  For example, on July 31, 2013, we completed the purchase of Amkor Technology Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.  Additionally, we increased our investment in J-Devices to   60%   in 2013 and to 100% in 2015 through the exercise of additional options, and as a result, we are now integrating J-Devices with our existing operations.  In addition, J-Devices continues to integrate the acquisitions it has previously completed with its operations.  As a result of the risks discussed above, the anticipated benefits of the increase in our investment in J-Devices or other future acquisitions, consolidations and partnering arrangements may not be fully realized, if at all, and these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Dependence on Materials and Equipment Suppliers - Our Business May Suffer If the Cost, Quality or Supply of Materials or Equipment Changes Adversely Including Any Disruption that May Occur in the Supply of Certain Materials due to Regulations and Customer Requirements. 
    
  We obtain from various vendors the materials and equipment required for the packaging and test services performed by our factories.  We source most of our materials, including critical materials such as leadframes, laminate substrates and gold wire, from a limited group of suppliers.  A disruption to the operations of one or more of our suppliers could have a negative impact on our business.  For example, the severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011 had a significant adverse effect on the electronics industry supply chain by impacting the supply of specialty chemicals, substrates, silicon wafers, equipment and other supplies to the electronics industry.  In addition, we purchase the majority of our materials on a purchase order basis.  Our business may be harmed if we cannot obtain materials and other supplies from our vendors in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities, at acceptable quality or at competitive prices.  Some of our customers are also dependent on a limited number of suppliers for certain materials and silicon wafers.  Shortages or disruptions in our customers' supply channels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  For example, the shortage in the supply of 28 nanometer wafers to some of our customers in 2012 delayed or otherwise adversely impacted the demand for certain of our advanced packaging and test services. 
    
  Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in our products.  Industry associations and many of our customers are also implementing initiatives to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of these materials and, in some cases, requiring us to certify that the covered materials we use in our packages do not come from the conflict areas.  We may incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements and customer initiatives.  These requirements and customer initiatives could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of materials used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain conflict-free materials in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices or that we will be able to verify the origin of all of the materials we use in our manufacturing process.  If we are unable to meet these requirements and customer initiatives, it could adversely affect our business as some customers may move their business to other suppliers.  Our reputation could also be adversely affected. 
    
  We purchase new packaging and test equipment to maintain and expand our operations.  From time to time, increased demand for new equipment may cause lead times to extend beyond those normally required by equipment vendors.  For example, in the past, increased demand for equipment caused some equipment suppliers to only partially satisfy our equipment orders in the normal time frame or to increase prices during market upturns for the semiconductor industry.  The unavailability of equipment or failures to deliver equipment on a timely basis could delay or impair our ability to meet customer orders.  If we are unable to meet customer orders, we could lose potential and existing customers.  Generally, we acquire our equipment on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term equipment agreements.  As a result, we  

-   39  - 

     Table of Contents  

could experience adverse changes in pricing, currency risk and potential shortages in equipment in a strong market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
    
  We are a large buyer of gold and other commodity materials including substrates and copper.  The prices of gold and other commodities used in our business fluctuate.  Historically, we have been able to partially offset the effect of commodity price increases through price adjustments to some customers and changes in our product designs that reduce the material content and cost, such as the use of shorter, thinner, gold wire and migration to copper wire.  However, we typically do not have long-term contracts that permit us to impose price adjustments, and market conditions may limit our ability to do so.  Significant price increases may adversely impact our gross margin in future periods to the extent we are unable to pass along past or future commodity price increases to our customers. 
    
  Customer Concentration and Loss of Customers - The Loss of Certain Customers or Reduced Orders or Pricing from Existing Customers May Have a Significant Adverse Effect on Our Operations and Financial Results. 
    
  We have derived and expect to continue to derive a large portion of our revenues from a small group of customers during any particular period due in part to the concentration of market share in the semiconductor industry.  Our ten largest customers together accounted for 63% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, and two customers each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales during the period.  In addition, we have significant customer concentration within our end markets, particularly mobile communications.  The loss of a significant customer, a business combination among our customers, a reduction in orders or decrease in price from a significant customer or disruption in any of our significant strategic partnerships or other commercial arrangements may result in a decline in our sales and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
    
  The demand for our services from each customer is directly dependent upon that customer's level of business activity and purchasing decisions, the quality and price of our services, our cycle time and delivery performance, the customer's qualification of additional competitors on products we package or test and a number of other factors.  Each of these factors could vary significantly from year to year resulting in the loss or reduction of customer orders.  Our business is likely to remain subject to this variability in order levels, and we cannot assure you that our key customers or any other customers will continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as in past periods. 
    
  For example, if a key customer decides to purchase wafers from a semiconductor foundry that provides packaging and test services, our business could be reduced if the customer also engages that foundry for related packaging and test services.  We cannot assure that customer decisions regarding the purchase of semiconductor wafers will not significantly and adversely impact customer demand for our packaging and test services. 
  In addition, from time to time we may acquire or build new facilities, such as our new factory and research and development center in Korea, or migrate existing business among our facilities.  In connection with these facility changes, our customers require us to re-qualify the new facilities even though we have already qualified to perform the services at our other facilities.  We cannot assure that we will successfully re-qualify or that our customers will not qualify our competitors and move the business for such services. 
    
  Capital Expenditures - We Make Substantial Investments in Equipment and Facilities To Support the Demand Of Our Customers, Which May Adversely Affect Our Business If the Demand Of Our Customers Does Not Develop As We Expect or Is Adversely Affected.    
    
  We make significant investments in equipment and facilities in order to service the demand of our customers.  For example, we expect that our 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately   $650 million  .  The amount of our capital expenditures depends on several factors, including the performance of our business, our assessment of future industry and customer demand, our capacity utilization levels and availability, our liquidity position and the availability of financing.  Our ongoing capital expenditure requirements may strain our cash and short-term asset balances, and, in periods when we are expanding our capital base, we expect that depreciation expense and factory operating expenses associated with our capital expenditures to increase production capacity will put downward pressure on our gross margin, at least over the near term.  From time to time, we also make significant capital expenditures based on specific business opportunities with one or a few key customers, and the additional equipment purchased may not be readily usable to support other customers.  If demand is insufficient to fill our capacity, or we are unable to efficiently redeploy such equipment, our capacity utilization and gross margin could  

-   40  - 

     Table of Contents  

be negatively impacted.  Our capital expenditures or cost per square foot may increase as we transition to new or more advanced packaging and test technologies because, among other things, new equipment used for these technologies is generally more expensive and often our existing equipment cannot be redeployed in whole or part for these technologies. 
    
  Furthermore, if we cannot generate or raise additional funds to pay for capital expenditures, particularly in some of the advanced packaging and bumping areas, as well as research and development activities, our growth and future profitability may be adversely affected.  Our ability to obtain external financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including: 
             
    our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; 
                
    general market conditions for financing; 
                
    volatility in fixed income, credit and equity markets and 
                
    economic, political and other global conditions. 
     The lead time needed to order, install and put into service various capital investments is often significant, and, as a result, we often need to commit to capital expenditures in advance of our receipt of firm orders or advance deposits based on our view of anticipated future demand with only very limited visibility.  Although we seek to limit our exposure in this regard, in the past we have from time to time expended significant capital for additional equipment or facilities for which the anticipated demand did not materialize for a variety of reasons, many of which were outside of our control.  To the extent this occurs in the future, our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
    
  In addition, during periods where customer demand exceeds our capacity, customers may transfer some or all of their business to other suppliers who are able to support their needs.  To the extent this occurs, our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
    
  In September 2014, we started the construction of our new K5 facility in Korea.  The land purchase agreement includes various construction, investment, hiring, regulatory and other compliance obligations.  There can be no assurance regarding when our new K5 facility in Korea will be fully utilized, or that the actual scope, costs timeline or benefits of the project will be consistent with our current expectations. 
    
  Impairment Charges - Any Impairment Charges Required Under U.S. GAAP May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Net Income. 
    
  Under U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, intellectual property, goodwill and other intangibles for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Factors we consider include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends and our market capitalization relative to net book value.  We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined.  Such charges have had and could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and our operating flexibility under our debt covenants.  
    
  Litigation Incident to Our Business Could Adversely Affect Us. 
    
  We have been a party to various legal proceedings, including those described from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC, and may be a party to legal proceedings in the future.  These proceedings could require significant management time and resources and, if an unfavorable ruling or outcome were to occur in these legal proceedings, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.

We Could Suffer Adverse Tax and Other Financial Consequences if There Are Changes in Tax Laws or Taxing Authorities Do Not Agree with Our Interpretation of Applicable Tax Laws, Including Whether We Continue to Qualify for Our Tax Holidays, or if We Are Required to Establish or Adjust Valuation Allowances on Deferred Tax Assets. 
    
  Our operations are subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions with complicated and varied tax regimes.  Tax laws and income tax rates in these jurisdictions are subject to change due to economic and political conditions.  Changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  For example, in the U.S., there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.  We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries.  In addition, changes in tax laws or regulations enacted in response to guidelines proposed by organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development regarding transfer pricing and other international tax matters relating to multinational companies like Amkor could also adversely impact our future liability for income taxes in the jurisdictions where we operate.  Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any of these proposals might be enacted into law, if adopted they could have a material adverse impact. 
    
  Our corporate structure and operations are based, in part, on interpretations of various U.S. and foreign tax laws, including tax withholding requirements, compliance with tax holiday requirements, application of changes in tax law to our operations and other relevant laws of applicable taxing jurisdictions.  From time to time, the taxing authorities of the relevant jurisdictions may conduct examinations of our income tax returns and other regulatory filings.  We cannot assure you that the taxing authorities will agree with our interpretations, including whether we continue to qualify for our tax holidays.  To the extent they do not agree, we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which require significant payments or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.  We may also appeal the taxing authorities' determinations to the appropriate governmental authorities, but we cannot be sure we will prevail.  If we do not prevail, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges (or reduce tax assets) that adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries operate under tax holidays, which will expire in whole or in part at various dates in the future.  As those tax holidays expire, our tax expense will increase as income from those jurisdictions becomes subject to higher statutory income tax rates, thereby reducing our liquidity and cash flow. 
    
  We monitor on an ongoing basis our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and whether there is a need for a related valuation allowance.  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations.  For most of our foreign deferred tax assets, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize these deferred tax assets.  In the event taxable income falls short of current expectations, we may need to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets, which could materially affect our results of operations. 
    
  Intellectual Property - Our Business Will Suffer if We Are Not Able to Develop New Proprietary Technology, Protect Our Proprietary Technology and Operate Without Infringing the Proprietary Rights of Others. 
    
  The complexity and breadth of semiconductor packaging and test services are rapidly increasing.  As a result, we expect that we will need to develop, acquire and implement new manufacturing processes and packaging technologies and tools in order to respond to competitive industry conditions and customer requirements.  Technological advances also typically lead to rapid and significant price erosion and may make our existing packages less competitive or our existing inventories obsolete.  If we cannot achieve advances in packaging design or obtain access to advanced packaging designs developed by others, our business could suffer. 
    
  The need to develop and maintain advanced packaging capabilities and equipment could require significant research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions in future years.  In addition, converting to new packaging designs or process methodologies could result in delays in producing new package types, which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer orders and adversely impact our business. 
    
  The process of seeking patent protection takes a long time and is expensive.  There can be no assurance that patents will issue from pending or future applications or that, if patents are issued, the rights granted under the patents will provide us  

-   42  - 

     Table of Contents  

with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage.  Any patents we do obtain will eventually expire, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantage to us.  
  Some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application.  The confidentiality agreements on which we rely to protect these technologies may be breached and may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies.  There can be no assurance that other countries in which we market our services will protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the U.S. 
    
  Our competitors may develop, patent or gain access to know-how and technology similar or superior to our own.  In addition, many of our patents are subject to cross licenses, several of which are with our competitors.  The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding the infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights.  If any third party makes an enforceable infringement claim against us or our customers, we could be required to: 
             
    discontinue the use of certain processes or cease to provide the services at issue, which could curtail our business; 
                
    pay substantial damages; 
                
    develop non-infringing technologies, which may not be feasible or 
                
    acquire licenses to such technology, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
     We may need to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, including our rights under patent and intellectual property licenses with third parties, or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation, which could result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources.  Furthermore, if we fail to obtain necessary licenses, our business could suffer, and we could be exposed to claims for damages and injunctions from third parties, as well as claims from our customers for indemnification.  In the past, we have been involved in legal proceedings involving the acquisition and license of intellectual property rights, the enforcement of our existing intellectual property rights or the enforcement of the intellectual property rights of others.  Unfavorable outcomes in any legal proceedings involving intellectual property could result in significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  The potential impact from the legal proceedings referred to in this Quarterly Report on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could change in the future. 
    
  Packaging and Test Processes Are Complex and Our Production Yields and Customer Relationships May Suffer from Defects in the Services We Provide or if We do Not Successfully Implement New Technologies.  
    
  Semiconductor packaging and test services are complex processes that require significant technological and process expertise.  Defective packages primarily result from: 
             
    contaminants in the manufacturing environment; 
                
    human error; 
                
    equipment malfunction; 
                
    changing processes to address environmental requirements; 
                
    defective raw materials or 
                
    defective plating services. 
     Test is also complex and involves sophisticated equipment and software.  Similar to many software programs, these software programs are complex and may contain programming errors or  bugs.   The test equipment is also subject to malfunction.  In addition, the test process is subject to operator error. 
  These and other factors have, from time to time, contributed to lower production yields.  They may also do so in the future, particularly as we adjust our capacity, change our processing steps or ramp new technologies.  In addition, we must continue to develop and implement new packaging and test technologies, and expand our offering of packages to be competitive.  Our production yields on new packages, particularly those packages which are based on new technologies, typically are significantly lower than our production yields on our more established packages. 

-   43  - 

     Table of Contents  

Our failure to maintain quality standards or acceptable production yields, if significant and prolonged, could result in loss of customers, increased costs of production, delays, substantial amounts of returned goods and claims by customers relating thereto.  Any of these problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
    
  In addition, in line with industry practice, new customers usually require us to pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process that may take several months.  If we fail to qualify packages with potential customers or existing customers, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
    
  Competition - We Compete Against Established Competitors in the Packaging and Test Business as Well as Internal Customer Capabilities and May Face Competition from New Competitors, Including Foundries. 
    
  The outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive.  We face substantial competition from established and emerging packaging and test service providers primarily located in Asia, including companies with significantly greater processing capacity, financial resources, local presence, research and development operations, marketing, technology and other capabilities.  We also may face increased competition from domestic companies located in the People's Republic of China, or the PRC, where there are government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of the local semiconductor industry.  For example, STATS ChipPAC was acquired in 2015 by Jiangsu Electronics Technology Co., Ltd., a local PRC company.  Our competitors may also have established relationships, or enter into new strategic relationships, with one or more of the large semiconductor companies that are our current or potential customers, or key suppliers to these customers.  Consolidation among our competitors could also strengthen their competitive position.  For example, in 2016, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. and Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. announced their intention to become sister companies under a new joint holding company. 
    
  We also face competition from the internal capabilities and capacity of many of our current and potential IDM and foundry customers.  In addition, we compete with contract foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., which offer full turnkey services from silicon wafer fabrication through packaging and final test.  These semiconductor foundries, which are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do, have expanded their operations to include packaging and test services, and may continue to expand these capabilities in the future. 
    
  We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors or that our customers will not rely on internal sources for packaging and test services, or that our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will not be adversely affected by such increased competition.  
    
  Environmental, Health   Safety Laws and Initiatives - Future Environmental, Health   Safety Laws and Initiatives Could Place Additional Burdens on Our Manufacturing Operations. 
    
  The semiconductor packaging process generates by-products that are subject to extensive governmental regulations.  For example, at our foreign facilities we produce liquid waste when semiconductor wafers are diced into chips with the aid of diamond saws, then cooled with running water.  In addition, semiconductor packages have historically utilized metallic alloys containing lead (Pb) within the interconnect terminals typically referred to as leads, pins or balls.  Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in places we do business, impose various controls on the use, storage, handling, discharge and disposal of chemicals used in our production processes and on the factories we occupy and are increasingly imposing restrictions on the materials contained in semiconductor products.  We may become liable under these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations for the cost of compliance and cleanup of any disposal or release of hazardous materials arising out of our former or current operations, or otherwise as a result of the existence of hazardous materials on our properties.  In such an event, we could be held liable for damages, including fines, penalties and the cost of investigations and remedial actions, and could also be subject to revocation of permits negatively affecting our operations.   
    
  Public attention has focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor operations and the risk to neighbors of chemical releases from such operations and to the materials contained in semiconductor products.  For example, the European Union's Restriction of Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and similar laws in other jurisdictions impose strict restrictions on the use of lead and other hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.  In addition, increasing climate change and environmental concerns could result in our customers requesting  

-   44  - 

     Table of Contents  

that we and our suppliers exceed regulatory standards.  Complying with existing and possible future environmental, health and safety laws or related customer requests may impose upon us the need for additional equipment or other process requirements, restrict our ability to expand our operations, disrupt our operations, increase costs, subject us to liability or cause us to curtail our operations.  Furthermore, energy costs in general could increase significantly due to climate change and other regulations. 
    
  Our Business and Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected by Natural Disasters and Other Calamities. 
    
  We have significant packaging and test and other operations in locations which are subject to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, floods, droughts, volcanoes and other severe weather and geological events, and other calamities, such as fire; the outbreak of infectious diseases (such as Ebola, SARs or flu); industrial strikes; breakdowns of equipment; difficulties or delays in obtaining materials, equipment, utilities and services; political events; acts of war and terrorist incidents; industrial accidents and other events, that could disrupt or even shutdown our operations.  In addition, our suppliers and customers also have significant operations in such locations.  In the event of such a disruption or shutdown, we may be unable to reallocate production to other facilities in a timely or cost-effective manner (if at all) and we may not have sufficient capacity to service customer demands in our other facilities.  A natural disaster or other calamity that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  For example, in April 2016, our Kumamoto factory was damaged by earthquakes in Japan.  While production was restored at Kumamoto in the second quarter, our sales in the second quarter were reduced by approximately $15 million due to the temporary disruption in operations.  We incurred   $16.4 million   of earthquake related costs in the second and third quarters for damaged inventory, buildings and equipment.  There can be no assurance that the actual final costs and financial impact will be consistent with our current expectations, and additional repair costs and capital expenditures or shortfalls in insurance payments could result in a more significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Also, Japan experienced a severe earthquake and tsunami in 2011 that resulted in significant disruption in the electronics industry supply chain and adversely affected Japan's economy and consumer spending.  In addition, in October 2011, Thailand experienced substantial flooding which affected the facilities and operations of customers and suppliers in our industry.  In addition, some of the processes that we utilize in our operations place us at risk of fire and other damage.  For example, highly flammable gases are used in the preparation of wafers holding semiconductor devices for flip chip packaging.  Although we maintain insurance policies for various types of property, casualty and other risks, we do not carry insurance for all the above referred risks, and with regard to the insurance we do maintain, we cannot assure you that it would be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses.  As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by natural disasters and other calamities. 
    
  Mr. James J. Kim and Members of His Family Can Effectively Determine or Substantially Influence The Outcome of All Matters Requiring Stockholder Approval. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Mr. James J. Kim, the Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors, members of Mr. Kim's immediate family and affiliates owned approximately   137.6 million   shares, or approximately   58%  , of our outstanding common stock.  The Kim family also has options to acquire approximately   0.4 million   shares.  If the options are exercised, the Kim family's total ownership would be an aggregate of approximately   138.0 million   shares of our outstanding common stock or approximately   58%   of our outstanding common stock. 
    
  In June 2013, the Kim family exchanged their convertible notes issued by Amkor for approximately   49.6 million   shares of common stock (the  Convert Shares ).  The Convert Shares are subject to a voting agreement.  The agreement requires the Kim family to vote these shares in a  neutral manner  on all matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote, so that such Convert Shares are voted in the same proportion as all of the other outstanding securities (excluding the other shares owned by the Kim family) that are actually voted on a proposal submitted to Amkor's stockholders for approval.  The Kim family is not required to vote in a  neutral manner  any Convert Shares that, when aggregated with all other voting shares held by the Kim family, represent 41.6% or less of the total then-outstanding voting shares of our common stock.  The voting agreement for the Convert Shares terminates upon the earliest of (i) such time as the Kim family no longer beneficially owns any of the Convert Shares, (ii) consummation of a change of control (as defined in the voting agreement) or (iii) the mutual agreement of the Kim family and Amkor.

Mr. James J. Kim and his family and affiliates, acting together, have the ability to effectively determine or substantially influence matters submitted for approval by our stockholders by voting their shares or otherwise acting by written consent, including the election of our Board of Directors.  There is also the potential, through the election of members of our Board of Directors, that the Kim family could substantially influence matters decided upon by our Board of Directors.  This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business consolidation involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares, and could also negatively affect our stock's market price or decrease any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay.   Concentration of ownership also reduces the public float of our common stock.  There may be less liquidity and higher price volatility for the stock of companies with a smaller public float compared to companies with broader public ownership. Also, the sale or the prospect of the sale of a substantial portion of the Kim family shares may adversely affect the market price of our stock.

Exhibit 10.1  
    
  AGREEMENT AND RELEASE 
  In order to settle as fully as possible all known and unknown claims I, Joanne Solomon, might have against Amkor Technology, Incorporated (Company) and all related parties, the Company and I enter into the following Agreement and Release (Agreement).  My last day in the office is Monday, September 12, 2016, my last day of employment is Monday, September 12, 2016, and (whether I sign this Agreement or not) I will be paid my regular wages and any accrued, unused paid time off through Monday, September 12, 2016. 
  (a)  Special Payments and Severance Benefits  :  The payments that constitute the entire monetary consideration for this Agreement are as follows:   
    
  (i)  Payments  :  Within fourteen (14) days after the Effective Date (as defined in Paragraph (d)) of this Agreement, the Company will mail to my address on file or make a direct deposit to my account a lump sum payment in the gross amount of $460,000.  The Company will also make a lump sum payment to me in an amount equal to the bonus that would have been paid for the full year 2016, if any, under the Company s 2016 Executive Bonus Plan, if my employment had not been terminated.  The second lump sum payment, if any, will be made when payments are made to participants generally under the 2016 Plan. I understand that these are payments to which I am not otherwise entitled and that they will not be taken into account in determining my rights or benefits under any benefit program.  The Company will deduct applicable federal and state tax withholding and other amounts from these amounts as it determines it is required to do. 
    
  (ii)  COBRA  :  Upon my enrollment in COBRA continuation coverage, and provided I remain eligible for such coverage, the Company will pay directly the cost of my COBRA premium for a period of twelve (12) months. 
    
  (iii)  Outplacement Services  :  At my request, the Company will provide limited outplacement services rendered by a professional or firm of the Company s choosing to assist me in locating other employment.  The Company s provision of such services is contingent upon my cooperation with the outplacement professional or firm and my active efforts to locate another position. 
    
  (b)  Release  :  I release (  i.e.  , give up) all known and unknown claims that I presently have against the Company, its current and former, direct and indirect owners, parents, subsidiaries, brother-sister companies, and all other affiliates and related entities, and their current and former partners, employees, agents, and other related parties (Released Parties), arising at any time up to and including the date on which I sign this Agreement, except claims that the law does not permit me to waive by signing this Agreement.  For example, I am releasing all common law contract, tort, or other claims I might have, as well as all claims I might have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Worker Adjustment   Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Sections 1981 and 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and any similar domestic or foreign laws, such as the Arizona Civil Rights Act and the Arizona Equal Pay Law.  It is my intention that the language relating to the description of claims in this section shall be given the broadest possible interpretation permitted by law. 
    
  (c)  Applicable Law and Venue  :  This Agreement is governed by Federal law and the laws of Arizona, without regard to the conflicts of law principles of any jurisdiction.  I agree that any action to enforce or interpret this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Arizona, and I hereby waive any challenge to the laying of venue or exercise of jurisdiction by such courts. 
    
  (d)  Effective Date  :      The  Effective Date  of this Agreement shall be the date on which the revocation period described in Section (g)(v) below expires, provided that I have not revoked this Agreement.   
    
  (e)  Covenant Not to Sue; Challenge to Validity and Communication with Government Agency  :  I promise that I will not file, cause to be filed, join, or accept any relief in any lawsuit (either individually, with others, or as part of a class) pleading, raising, or asserting any claims released by this Agreement.  I agree that if I breach this promise, then I will reimburse each of the Released Parties for his, her, or its attorneys  fees and costs (or the applicable proportions thereof) incurred in defending against any such released claims.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement, including but not limited to the provisions in Paragraphs (f)(x) and (f)(xii), (i) limits or affects my right to challenge the validity of this Release under the ADEA or Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, and I shall not be required to pay the attorneys  fees or costs of any Released Party in connection with such challenge, or (ii) precludes me from filing an administrative charge, complaint,  

report, or other communication of any sort with any federal, state or local government office, official or agency.  However, I acknowledge that the above Release applies to all claims that I have under the ADEA, and that, unless the Release is held to be invalid, all such ADEA claims shall be extinguished.  Further, I promise never to seek or accept any damages, remedies or other relief for myself personally with respect to any claim released by Paragraph (b) of this Agreement, provided that I shall not be prohibited from receiving an   award for information provided to any government agency  . 
    
  (f)  Representations and Promises  :  The Company and I acknowledge and agree that: 
    
  (i)  Separation  :  On Monday, September 12, 2016, I ceased to be employed by the Company and each subsidiary and affiliate of the Company in any capacity.  I also resigned as a director, officer, or managing director of any of the Company s subsidiaries or affiliates, and I will execute promptly such documents as the Company may request to effect such resignation. 
    
  (ii)  Equity Vesting  :  I acknowledge and agree that any options scheduled to be granted to me or RSUs scheduled to vest which have not yet vested because I have not reached the time-based service requirement, will not be granted or will be forfeited, as the case may be, by nature of my no longer being a service provider of the Company.  A summary of outstanding and vested equity as of my termination date and the last date to exercise options was provided to me as Attachment A to this Agreement. 
    
  (iii)  Complete Agreement  :  This Agreement is the entire agreement relating to any claims or future rights that I might have with respect to the Company and the Released Parties, except for my obligations under the Memorandum of Agreement, the Employee Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Obligations Form, and/or the Confidentiality, Intellectual Property, and Insider Information Obligations Agreement.  Once in effect, this Agreement is a legally admissible and binding agreement.  It shall not be construed strictly for or against me, the Company, or any Released Party. 
    
  (iv)  Amendments; Successors and Assigns  :  This Agreement only may be amended by a written agreement that the Company and I both sign.  The rights and obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company.  I shall not be entitled to assign any of my rights or obligations under this Agreement.  
    
  (v)  Representations  :  When I decided to sign this Agreement, I was not relying on any representations that are not in this Agreement.  The Company would not have agreed to pay the consideration I am getting in exchange for this Agreement but for the representations and promises I am making by signing it.  I have not suffered any job-related wrongs or injuries, such as any type of discrimination, for which I might still be entitled to compensation or relief now or in the future.   
    
  (vi)  No Wrongdoing  :  This Agreement is not an admission of wrongdoing by the Company or any other Released Party; neither it nor any drafts shall be admissible evidence of wrongdoing. 
    
  (vii)  Unknown Claims  :  I am intentionally releasing claims that I do not know that I might have and that, with hindsight, I might regret having released.  I have not assigned or given away any of the claims I am releasing. 
    
  (viii)  Effect of Void Provision  :  If the Company or I successfully assert that any provision in this Agreement is void or otherwise unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law, unless the non-asserting party elects to cancel it.  If this Agreement is cancelled, I will repay the consideration I received for signing it. 
    
  (ix)  Consideration of Agreement  :  If I initially did not think any representation I am making in this Agreement was true or if I initially was uncomfortable making it, I resolved all my doubts and concerns before signing this Agreement.  I have carefully read this Agreement, I fully understand what it means, I am entering into it knowingly and voluntarily, and all my representations in it are true.  The Company would not have given me the Special Payments or Severance Benefits I am getting in exchange for this Agreement but for my representations and promises I am making by signing it.   
    
  (x)  Agreement to be Confidential  :  I agree that I will not disclose voluntarily or allow anyone else to disclose the existence, reason for, or contents of this Agreement without the Company s prior written consent, unless required to do so by law.  Notwithstanding this provision, I am authorized to disclose this Agreement to my spouse, attorneys, and tax advisors on a  need to know  basis, on the condition that they agree to hold the terms of the Agreement, including the payment terms, in strictest confidence; provided that I may disclose any information that has been publicly disclosed by the Company.   

Any disclosure to any third party by my spouse, attorneys, or tax advisors will be treated as a breach by me of the non-disclosure provisions of this paragraph.  I am further authorized to make appropriate disclosures as required by law, provided that, unless prohibited by law, I agree to provide the Company with sufficient advance notice prior to disclosure such that the Company may oppose disclosure and to cooperate with the Company in any such efforts.  Because it would be difficult or impossible to calculate the actual damages the Company would suffer if I violate my confidentiality obligations, which would be substantial, I agree to pay the Company $5,000 in damages for each violation.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit or prevent the Company from disclosing this Agreement or the circumstances relating thereto, including without limitation as required by securities law or stock exchange rule. 
    
  (xi)  Return of Property  :  I have returned to the Company all files, memoranda, documents, records, copies of the foregoing, Company-provided credit cards, keys, building passes, security passes, access or identification cards, and any other Company property in my possession or control.  To the extent I subsequently discover that any property and/or data identified above is still in my possession, custody or control, I agree to return all such property and data to the Company as soon as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) days after making such discovery.  I have cleared all expense accounts, repaid everything I owe to the Company or any Released Party, paid all amounts I owe on Company-provided credit cards or accounts (such as cell phone accounts), and canceled or personally assumed any such credit cards or accounts.  I agree not to incur any expenses, obligations, or liabilities on behalf of the Company. 
    
  (xii)  Nondisparagement  :  I agree not to criticize, denigrate, or otherwise disparage the Company, any other Released Party, or any of their products, processes, experiments, policies, practices, standards of business conduct, or areas or techniques of research.  However, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit me from testifying truthfully in any forum or contacting, cooperating with or providing information to any government agency or commission. 
    
  (xiii)  Cooperation:    I agree that following the Effective Date, I will provide reasonable assistance to and cooperate with the Company and its affiliates as to any claims, controversies, disputes, or complaints of which I have knowledge or that may relate to me or my employment or other relationships with Company or its affiliates.  Such cooperation includes but is not limited to providing the Company and its affiliates with all information known to me related to the foregoing, meeting with counsel, and appearing and giving testimony in any forum.  Company will reimburse me for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by me in providing assistance under this Agreement.  
    
  (xiv)  Section 409A:    I acknowledge that I and the Company intend that this Agreement be interpreted and administered so that any amount or benefit paid hereunder shall be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder ( Section 409A ).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees and advisors shall be held liable for any taxes, interest or other amounts owed by me as a result of Section 409A.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any  deferred compensation  (as defined in Section 409A) payable hereunder as a result of my termination of employment shall not be paid unless and until I have undergone a  separation from service  (as defined in Section 409A).
