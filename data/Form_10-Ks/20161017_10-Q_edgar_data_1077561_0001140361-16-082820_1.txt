CONDENSED    NOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. However, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted or condensed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. These condensed financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Loss Per Share

Basic earnings or (loss) per share ( EPS ) is computed as net loss divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period in accordance with  Earnings Per Share Topic of  Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB )  Accounting Standards Codification (  ASC ) . Diluted EPS includes the effect from potential dilutive securities and is equal to basic loss per share for all periods presented because there are no potential dilutive securities and the Company has incurred a net loss. All per share information is adjusted retroactively to reflect stock splits and changes in par value.

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has limited operations and has sustained substantial operating losses in recent years resulting in a substantial accumulated deficit. The Company s cash requirements for working capital have been satisfied through loans from its majority shareholder and the Company expects to obtain additional capital through shareholder loans and/or a debt or equity financing to continue its operations. There is no assurance the Company will be successful in raising the needed additional capital or that such additional funds will be available for the Company on acceptable terms, if at all. The Company s President, who is also the majority shareholder, has orally agreed to fund its operations for the next twelve months, based on the Company s current level of expenditures, as necessary. However, the Company s need for capital may change dramatically if it acquires a suitable business opportunity during that period. In view of these matters, the continued existence of the Company is dependent upon its ability to meet its financing requirements on a continuing basis and to succeed in its future operations.

Management s plans are to identify and pursue profitable business opportunities through mergers and acquisitions, so as to diversify the business risks and maximize the returns to stockholders.

To meet these objectives, the Company plans to seek potential merger candidates and expects to raise additional capital through private equity and/or debt investment in order to support existing operations and expand the range and scope of its business. There is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for the Company on acceptable terms, if at all. Management believes that actions presently taken to revise the Company s operating and financial requirements provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to achieve these objectives cannot be determined at this time. If the Company is unsuccessful in its endeavors, it may have to cease operations.

NOTE 3   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Amount due to a stockholder of $734,263 at August 31, 2016 (at November 30, 2015: $709,895) represents a series of advances from the majority stockholder to fund working capital requirements. There is no note and the amounts are unsecured, interest-free, and repayable on demand. The majority stockholder, who is also the Company s President, has orally agreed to fund the Company s operations for at least the next twelve months.

Item 2. 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

PRELIMINARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The statements contained in this Form 10-Q that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements. These include statements about the Company s expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which are indicated by words or phrases such as  anticipate ,  expect ,  intend ,  plan ,  will ,  the Company believes ,  management believes  and similar words or phrases. The forward-looking statements are based on the Company s current expectations and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Company s actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the Company on the date hereof, and the Company assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the Company that are to advise interested parties of the factors which affect the Company s business, in this report, as well as the Company s periodic reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

These risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, include (i) the sufficiency of existing capital resources and the Company s ability to raise additional capital to fund cash requirements for future operations; (ii) uncertainties involved in the acquisition of an operating business in a targeted industry and/or a targeted geographic region; (iii) the Company s ability to achieve sufficient revenues through an operating business to fund and maintain operations; (iv) volatility of the stock market; and (v) general economic conditions. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, such expectations may prove to be incorrect. Investors should be aware that they could lose all or substantially all of their investment.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Based on the Company s current level of limited operations, the Company does not believe it has any critical accounting policies at this time.

Results of Operations   The Three Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended August 31, 2015

The Company did not recognize any revenue in each of the three-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015.

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of public company compliance expenses, including legal and accounting expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended August 31, 2016 decreased 13.8%, or $993, to $6,212 from $7,205 for the three-month period August 31, 2015. The lower expenses were primarily due to the decrease in legal expenses.

Other (Income) Expense 

The Company did not incur any interest expense or earn any interest income for the three-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015.

Results of Operations   The Nine Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended August 31, 2015 

Revenues 

The Company did not recognize any revenue in each of the nine-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015.

The lower expenses were primarily due to the decrease in audit fees and legal expenses.

Index 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

The Company does not currently have any cash or any other significant assets. However, the Company believes that, based on an oral commitment from its majority stockholder, who is also the President of the Company, to fund the Company s operating activities at its current level of expenditures, it has sufficient resources to meet the anticipated needs of its operations, such as maintaining its required continuous disclosure and reporting requirements with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the next twelve months, though there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company had no revenues for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and its need for capital may change dramatically if it acquires a suitable business opportunity during the next twelve months. Therefore, the Company plans to rely on shareholder loans and the raising of debt or equity capital to continue its operations. There is no assurance the Company will be successful in raising the needed capital.

We have incurred net losses since inception, expect to incur losses in the future associated with the costs of operating as a public company, and may never achieve revenues or profitability unless we complete a successful merger. We have never recognized any revenue from the sale of products or any other source. Our operating losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders  equity. We do not know when or if we will ever generate revenue or become profitable because of the significant uncertainties with respect to our ability to acquire a suitable business opportunity.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Item 4. 
 
 Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the  Certifying Officer ) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (a) accumulated and communicated to our management, including to our Certifying Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and (b) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Since that evaluation process was completed, there have been no significant changes in our disclosure controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls.

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with this evaluation that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
