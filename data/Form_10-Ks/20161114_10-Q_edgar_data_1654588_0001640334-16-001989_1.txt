     Table of Contents          HIP CUISINE, INC.      Notes to the Condensed   Consolidated Financial Statements      For The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016     (  Unaudited)       NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS      Hip Cuisine, Inc. (the  Company  or  HIP ) was incorporated in the State of Florida on March 19, 2014. The Company s sole subsidiary Hip Cuisine, Inc. ( HCP ) was incorporated in Panama on February 24, 2014. The Company s fiscal year end is December 31.     The Company intends to open Latin American fusion restaurants that deliver fast nutritious healthy food in Panama, Colombia and Miami, Florida, USA.      NOTE 2     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of Presentation       The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. For further information regarding the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to the audited financial statements and for the year ended December 31, 2015. The financial statements are stated in United States dollars.       Basis of Consolidation       These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hip Cuisine, Inc. (Panama). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial statements.       NOTE 3     GOING CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS      The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet generated significant revenues since inception. As at September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated loss from operations of $287,959. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     The continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to continue to raise adequate financing and to commence profitable operations in the future and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations as they become due.                 F-5

     Table of Contents          Common Stock      On June 29, 2016, the Company issued 25,333 restricted common shares at $0.375 as partial deposit payment for a consulting contract on the second restaurant location in Costa del Este, Panama which started in September 2016.

NOTE 8   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES      The Company currently leases 152.18 square meters of space at Balboa Boutiques located in Panama City, Panama. The current lease term began on July 1, 2015 and expires on February 27, 2017, but is automatically renewable for an additional thirty-six months under the original lease terms. The Company intends to renew the lease when the term expires. The monthly lease payment is $3,671 per month. This location serves as the Company s only facility for day to day operations.     On January 22, 2016, the Company entered into a 5 year lease agreement, which will start from 2016 August, for a second restaurant location in Costa del Este Panama. The total square meters is 182.72 and the rent for the location will be approximately $8,222 per month.

The Company has no other commitments or contingencies as of September 30, 2016.     The following is a schedule by years of minimum future rentals on leases as of September 30, 2016:           From time to time the Company may become a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company. Management believes that it is adequately insured for its operations and there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.      NOTE 9   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. Based on our evaluation no other material events have occurred that require disclosure, other than stated below.     On October 12, 2016, the Company issued 333,000 common shares at $0.375 to complete and close its registered public offering of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock.

The closing on the assets will occur on February 15, 2017.                 F-7       
     Table of Contents           ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of such financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to useful lives of real estate assets, bad debts, impairment, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable SEC regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements" above.       Plan of Operation        Our Business      Hip Cuisine, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Florida on March 24, 2014. Our United States offices are currently located at 2250 NW 114 th  Ave. Unit 1P, PTY 11020, Miami, FL 33172-3652. Our Panama offices are located at Balboa Boutiques, Ave. Balboa, Local B104, Panama City, Panama. Our telephone number is 011-507-6501-8105.     On September 30, 2014, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement") with Hip Cuisine, Inc., a Panamanian corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Republic of Panama on February 24, 2014 ("Hip Panama"), and its sole shareholder, and our Chief Executive Officer, President and Director, Natalia Lopera, whereby we acquired one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding common stock of Hip Panama in exchange for 5,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. Upon the consummation of the Share Exchange Agreement, Hip Panama became a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company.     Hip Cuisine, Inc. has created a restaurant concept that combines the Health Food restaurant which uses the brand Healthy, Vegan   Raw to identify to the public what it has to offer which is low sodium, low calorie, high in protein dishes and the ingredients are Vegan Friendly, Vegetarian and a full menu with fresh fish, chicken and steak the vegetables are purchased fresh daily from the local farmers market. We also added with the restaurant a full array of "Cold Press Juices   Smoothies". The United States is exploding with the Cold Press juice stores to meet the demand of the general public who have moved to a Healthier Diet and who are becoming more conscience of what foods they are consuming into their bodies.     We made the decision to open the first location in Panama City Panama for several reasons. The main reason was the fact that the Health   Fitness market in Central and South America was growing at a very rapid pace and compared to the United States the Cold Press and Healthy Food restaurants were virtually nonexistent. In fact we know of only four Vegan restaurants in all of Panama City. In addition, Panama City is one of the fastest growing cities in Latin America and with the expansion of the Panama Canal there is a very large international population and they are looking for Healthy alternative than what is currently being offered in Panama. The labor is substantially less yet the prices of the dishes are equal to that of the United States.     We opened for business in July of 2015 after 15 months of construction at the Balboa Boutiques shopping mall located on Ave. Balboa, which is a prime location in Panama City near the financial district and on the water. A major renovation to the "Cinta Costera" along Balboa now offers a biking and jogging trail along with exercise equipment, basketball and tennis courts and this extends for 5 kilometers along Balboa Ave. and continues over the water all the way to the Amador which is Panama City's main marina. Every Sunday they close Ave. Balboa and set up biking events and other events like Yoga classes and more.                 4       
     Table of Contents         We have entered into a lease to open a second restaurant location, and this location will be 120 square meters larger than our first location in the Balboa Boutiques shopping center in Panama City. The extra meters will be used to build the production kitchen where we will prepare the meal packages and juices for the restaurant and deliveries. We will use the funds raised in the initial round of financing to build the restaurant and the production kitchen. The cost to buildout the second restaurant and production kitchen is estimated to cost approximately $225,000.     Once completed, we have already designed and can order the packaging, labels and bottles for delivery. We currently use a POS system called LAVU and this can handle everything from inventory control, orders, menu and employee payroll. It is a complete system designed for restaurants and is scalable. The only additional cost is for the equipment for the additional restaurants, such as I-Pads, kitchen printer, fiscal printer and cashier I-pad and register, which is approximately $4,500 per location. Then we pay a monthly service fee that is approximately $105.00 per month.     We currently offer to our customers at the Balboa Boutiques locations the ability to purchase one day detox (6 juices) or 3 day detox (18 juices), as well as weekly meal plans. These plans range from $37.50 for the 1 day, $112.50 for the 3 day detox and $150 for the weekly meal plan.     We have budgeted a total cost of $16,000 to complete the website which will allow us to accept on line orders for our customers who want deliveries. Currently we use a delivery service to deliver orders, and they charge $3.50 per delivery and pay for the order when they pick up.     The initial financing round will cover the second location as well as the production kitchen and website for our deliveries and meal plans. It will be necessary to raise additional capital until we have at least 10 locations opened and operating. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any additional funds will be available to us.     Our goals over the next twelve (12) months are to:                      Use the Balboa location to offer Cold Press juices along with daily dishes to customers who commit to a 30 day diet program.                             Locate and start construction of the second location in Costa del Este, Panama.                             Locate and start construction of the "Hub   Spoke" location which will produce and bottle the juices and smoothies then deliver to the restaurants and other outlets throughout Panama such as local gyms and Health Food stores.                             Develop the online ordering system for deliveries through the website.          Expenditures      The following chart provides an overview of our budgeted expenditures by significant area of activity over the next twelve (12) months, assuming we are able to attract sufficient debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract financing and we may be required to scale back operations accordingly (See "Risk Factors").     The following table outlines the planned use of working capital. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us, and our inability to obtain such financing would materially impact our ability to execute our business plan as outlined in this Registration Statement (See "Risk Factors").                 5       
     Table of Contents                Milestones        Months 1 through 9       During the first nine (9) months we plan to:               O    Prove out the Hip Cuisine restaurant concept                   O    Enter into deliveries and monthly diet programs                   O    Complete Trademark registration to protect our business names, logos and slogans                   O    Enter contract with second restaurant and Hub   Spoke location for processing facility           Months 9 through 12       During the following three (3) months, we expect to achieve the following:               O    Complete the construction of the second restaurant location.                   O    Complete the construction of the "Hub   Spoke" Cold Press processing facility.                   O    Launch new website to handle online deliveries and POS processing.         We do not currently have any arrangements for financing and we can provide no assurance to investors we will be able to find such financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us, or on terms that are acceptable. Consequently, we may not be able to proceed with our intended business plan.                 6

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates, amongst other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the course of business.     We anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to fund our growth, pay our current obligations and future capital expenditures. The primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from private sources and/or debt financing.                 8       
     Table of Contents           Going Concern Consideration       Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the accompanying financial statements expressing concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.       Critical Accounting Policies       The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as additional information is obtained, as more experience is acquired, as our operating environment changes and as new events occur. Our critical accounting policies are listed in the notes to our audited financial statements included in this registration Statement.       Future Financings.       We will continue to rely on equity sales of the Company's Common Stock in order to continue to fund business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing shareholders. There is no assurance that the Company will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned operations       Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.       The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.       The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

During the period covered by this report, the Company has had no changes in or disagreements with its accountants.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk        ITEM 3.
