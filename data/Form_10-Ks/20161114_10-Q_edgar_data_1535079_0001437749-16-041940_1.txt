Note 1: Organization and Basis of Presentation   
     
  McorpCX, Inc. (the "Company",  we ,  us ) is a for profit corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of California, United States of America on December 14, 2001. We operated as The Innes Group, Inc., d/b/a MCorp Consulting until filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation renaming the Company Touchpoint Metrics, Inc., effective October 18, 2011. During Q1 2015, the Company filed a d/b/a (doing business as) with the State of California Secretary of State to begin doing business as McorpCX. On June 11, 2015, at our Annual General Meeting, shareholders passed a resolution to change the name of the Company to McorpCX, Inc.  
     
  We develop and deliver technology-enabled services and software products that enable customer experience management capabilities for corporations. Our products are intended to assist companies with business performance by measuring and transforming the ways they interact with customers. We serve a wide variety of industries and customer sizes.  
     
  The condensed financial statements and related disclosures as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are unaudited, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In our opinion, these condensed financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the results for the interim periods. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on Form 10-K with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to "McorpCX," "we," "us," "our" or the "Company" are to McorpCX, Inc. and our subsidiaries.  

Note 2: Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases: (Topic 842), to provide guidance on recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements, specifically differentiating between different types of leases. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from all leases. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous GAAP. There continues to be a differentiation between finance leases and operating leases. However, the principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases should be recognized in the statement of financial position. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. These practical expedients relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date, initial direct costs for leases that commenced before the effective date, and the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase the underlying asset. An entity that elects to apply the practical expedients will, in effect, continue to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous GAAP unless the lease is modified, except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP. We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on its financial statements.

  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-9, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, to reduce complexity in accounting standards involving several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including (1) the income tax consequences, (2) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and (3) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition, amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively, amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied prospectively, and amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows can be applied using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations, to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and address how an entity should assess whether it is the principal or the agent in contracts that include three or more parties. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our financial statements.  
     
  In April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, to clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: 1) identifying performance obligations, and 2) the licensing implementation guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our financial statements.  
     
  In May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, to clarify certain core recognition principles including collectability, sales tax presentation, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and disclosures no longer required if the full retrospective transition method is adopted. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our financial statements.  
     
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method, and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on its financial statements.

Note 3: Capitalized Software Development Costs    
     
  Costs incurred to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) technology consist of external direct costs of materials and services and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who directly devote time to the project. Research and development costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Capitalization begins when technological feasibility is established. Costs incurred during the operating stage of the software application relating to upgrades and enhancements are capitalized to the extent that they result in the extended life of the product. All other costs are expensed as incurred. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 expenses relating to upgrades and enhancements of $376,878 were capitalized.  
     
  Amortization of software development costs commenced when the product was available for general release to customers. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the three-year expected useful life of the software. Capitalized software development costs, net of amortization, were $371,350 and $61,224 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Amortization expense incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $66,751 and $54,827, respectively and is included in cost of goods sold.  

Note 4: Intangible Assets   
     
  Intangibles as of September 30, 2016 consisted of the following:  

We began development of a new Company website in September 2014; related costs incurred during the design and production stages of website development were capitalized prior to its go-live date, which occurred in March 2015.  Now that the website is live, all capitalized costs are amortized using straight-line basis over two years, the estimated economic life of the completed website.  
     
  Acquisition of media distribution rights occurred in May 2016 and all capitalized costs are amortized using straight-line basis over two years, the estimated economic life of this asset.  
     
  Acquisition of intellectual property occurred in June 2016 and capitalized costs are amortized using straight-line basis over two years, the estimated economic life of this asset.  
     
  Our intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  There were no impairment charges during the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  Total amortization of intangible assets was $29,710 and $18,321 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Note 5: Stock-Based Compensation   
     
  Our stock-based compensation plan was originally established in 2008. The shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the terms of such plan (the  Plan Shares ) could not exceed 30% of any outstanding issue or 2,500,000 shares, whichever was the lower amount.   
     
  In December 2015, we adopted a revised share option plan in which Plan Shares cannot exceed 10% of the total issued and outstanding shares at any given time. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant and all option grants have a 10-year term. This share option plan was approved by the Company s shareholders at the annual meeting of shareholders on August 10, 2016.  
     
  To calculate the fair value of stock options at the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The volatility used is based on a blended historical volatility of our own stock and similar sized companies due to the limited historical data available for our own stock price.  The expected term was determined based on the simplified method outlined in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110.  The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, 945,000 stock options were exercisable and $195,295 of total compensation cost related to vested share-based compensation grants had been recognized for nine months ended September 30, 2016. Unrecognized compensation expense from stock options was $301,259 at September 30, 2016, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.54 years beginning October 1, 2016.   
     
  The following table summarizes our stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

The following assumptions were used to calculate weighted average fair values of the options granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

Note 6: Concentrations   
     
  We sell products and services under various terms to a broad range of companies across multiple industries ranging from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies, with sales historically concentrated among a few large clients. In 2016 we have made efforts to mitigate risk from loss of a single client and have shifted sales concentration to a more even distribution among our clients. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the percentage of sales and the concentrations are:  

Sales are made without collateral and the credit-related losses have been insignificant or non-existent. Accordingly, there is no provision made to include an allowance for doubtful accounts.  

Note 7: Debt   
     
  On September 16, 2011, a $100,000 CAD note was executed with an individual, a 1.64% shareholder. The note is structured to incur a balloon payment of the principal and 4% APR non-compounding accrued interest on its amended maturity date of September 5, 2017.  Effective October 31, 2016 the note's previous maturity date of September 16, 2016 was amended to extend the maturity date by 1 year. We have recorded unrealized loss of $5,682 and a gain of $10,386 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the revaluation of this note's principal from CAD to USD.  As of September 30, 2016, principal and accrued interest was $76,370 and $6,419, respectively.  
     
  On September 7, 2011, a $50,000 USD note was executed with McLellan Investment Corporation, an unrelated party. The note is structured to incur a balloon payment of the principal and 4% APR non-compounding accrued interest on its amended maturity date of September 7, 2016. The note is currently being negotiated to extend the maturity date by 1 year. As of September 30, 2016, principal and accrued interest was $50,000 and $4,083, respectively.  
     
  Interest expense was $11,822 and $11,167 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and consists of interest on our short-term promissory notes, and credit card balances.

Note 8: Shareholders Equity   
     
  On February 2, 2016 we completed a private placement of 3,660,000 restricted shares of common stock in consideration for $2,745,000 or at a rate of $0.75 per share. The private placement was completed in connection with and as a condition of our listing on the TSX Venture Exchange. The proceeds will be used for sales and marketing, product development and for general working capital purposes.  
     
  The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value per share. At the Company s annual meeting of shareholders held on August 10, 2016, the Company s shareholders approved a resolution to increase the total number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue from 30,000,000 shares of common stock to the current 500,000,000 shares of common stock.  

Note 9: Going Concern   
     
  The accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had a net loss of $862,252.  We also had a net loss of $649,893 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These circumstances result in substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern which is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably, or raise additional capital through debt financing and/or through sales of common stock.  
     
  The failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability or obtain the additional funding would be detrimental.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

McorpCX | Persona is designed to improve the results of customer facing initiatives, and designed to help customer-centric businesses and the agencies and consultancies that serve them to better understand, connect with and serve their customers.  
     
  Our professional services are intended to help primarily large and medium sized organizations plan, design and deliver better customer experiences, and to analyze and review client data gathered through our software application. Other services include customer experience training, strategy consulting and business process optimization, which are intended to increase our customers' adoption of our products and services, help our customers maximize their return on investment, and improve our customers' efficiency.  
     
  Development of our software is ongoing, as both Touchpoint Mapping  On-Demand and McorpCX | Persona are refined and improved based on customer feedback, and customized for specific organizations and industry sectors. The services delivered with our products may include consulting and additional research services, as well as services such as assessment, integration, implementation and additional offline analysis and reporting of data.  
     
  Though we initially released Touchpoint Mapping    On-Demand in 2013, we cannot predict the timing or probability of generating material sales revenue from it.  Similarly, we released McorpCX | Persona in September of 2016 and cannot predict the timing or probability of generating material sales revenue from it either. As of this filing, we have yet to engage the necessary sales and marketing staff or possess the capabilities required to identify, develop, and close material product sales opportunities, and currently lack sufficient resources to market and sell our products in the manner which we believe is required to achieve our product sales and revenue growth objectives.

Sources of Revenue   
     
  Our revenue consisted primarily of professional and software-enabled consulting services, product sales and other revenues in 2016 and 2015. Consulting services include customer experience management consulting in the areas of strategy development, planning, education, training and program design, and includes the articulation of customer-centric strategies and implementation roadmaps in support of these strategies. Product revenue is from productized and software-enabled service sales not elsewhere classified, while other revenue includes reimbursement of related travel costs and out-of-pocket expenses.  
     
  While our plan of operations is based on migrating the majority of our service revenue from these categories to recurring SaaS subscription fees, we anticipate that fees for professional and software-enabled consulting services will remain a significant revenue source in the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2016, we have successfully delivered certain features and functionality of our software product, Touchpoint Mapping    On-Demand, to several clients. However, we have not obtained material stand-alone sales commitments for Touchpoint Mapping    On-Demand or McorpCX | Persona, and do not anticipate being able to do so until we engage the necessary sales and marketing staff to develop and execute product sales opportunities.  
     
  Should we successfully obtain material sales commitments for Touchpoint Mapping    On-Demand or McorpCX | Persona, we anticipate that subscription agreements and related professional services associated with delivering our software solutions will become a source of increased revenue. Subscriptions and associated professional services pricing are based on our gross margin objectives, growth strategies and the specific needs of our clients' organizations, measured primarily by the following metrics: breadth of insights sought, number of employees, number of customers and customer segments, frequency of insights gathered, and other variables.  
     
  Subscription agreements for our software solutions are offered as monthly term agreements which contain a minimum commitment period of at least 12 months, and which include related setup, upgrades, hosting and support. Professional services include consulting fees related to implementation, customization, configuration, training and other services.  
     
  Based on data gathered during the implementation stage of on-demand software and software-enabled services engagements, we believe that the average time it will take our clients from placing an order to live deployment of our products is between 30 and 45 days. We typically invoice clients upon inception of subscription agreements for setup and total subscription fees contracted over the term of the agreements, with payment due within 30 days.  
     
  Professional services related to the subscription agreements are invoiced at the inception of the professional services agreement at a negotiated percentage of total fees, often but not exclusively one-third or one-half of the total estimated professional services fees, with the balance of payments due over the duration of the contract as project milestones are met. Amounts invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether revenue recognition criteria have been met.  
     
   Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses   
     
  Our costs of revenue and operating expenses are detailed at the sub-category level in our Income Statements. And while the financial results for these categories are further explained in the Results of Operations section below, a general description of these categories follows:  
     
    Cost of Goods Sold    
     
  Cost of goods sold has historically consisted primarily of expenses directly related to providing professional and consulting services. Those expenses include contract labor, third-party services, and materials and travel expenses related to providing professional services to our clients.  However, as certain features of Touchpoint Mapping    On-Demand were made available for general release beginning in 2014, costs of goods now also includes significant product-related hosting and monitoring costs, licenses for products embedded in the application, amortization of capitalized software development costs, related sales commissions, service support, account management and subscriptions, as applicable.  

-13-

Should our client base grow, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our hosting, technical support and professional services capabilities, as well as our utilization of third-party licensed software.   
     
    General and Administrative Expenses    
     
  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related expenses for management, client delivery, finance and accounting, and marketing personnel. Expenses also include contract services, as well as marketing and promotion costs, professional fees, software license fee expenses, administrative costs, insurance, rent and a portion of travel expenses and other overhead, which are categorized as  other general and administrative expenses  in our financial statements.  
     
  Sales and marketing expenses are currently reflected in salaries and wages, commissions, contract labor, sales, marketing and promotion, and other related overhead expense categories. Since we currently recognize revenue over the terms of the subscriptions or professional services engagements, we expect to experience a delay between increases in selling and marketing expenses and the recognition of revenue. We expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of expenses as we hire sales and additional marketing personnel and increase the level of marketing activities.  
     
  We expect that total general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel in connection with the growth of our business. In addition to increases in sales and marketing and research and development expenses, in order to meet the requirements of a public company we anticipate we will also incur additional employee salaries and related expenses, professional service fees and insurance costs in connection with any growth of our business and operations.  
     
   Results of Operations   

Total revenues were 19% higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to increased revenues from consulting services. Revenues also increased from our software products and software related services in the nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.   
     
  Total revenues in the third quarter of 2016 were 76% higher than total revenues in the third quarter of 2015, mainly due to increased revenue from consulting services. Revenue has been growing in the second and third quarters primarily as a result of management s re-focus on business development and revenue generating efforts after the first quarter of 2016.   
     
  During the first quarter of 2016, we focused on internal initiatives that we believed were critical to our long-term growth. These initiatives included the listing of our shares of common stock on the TSX Venture Exchange and the closing of the related private placement of our common stock in February 2016.  

-14-

Cost of goods sold increased by $67,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to an increase of approximately $64,000 in professional fee costs. This increase corresponds with the increase in revenues from consulting services and is primarily due to the Company s need to contract outside services to assist with delivery of professional services.   
     
  Cost of goods sold decreased by $36,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease of $48,000 in reimbursable expenses such as lodging, meals and entertainment and transportation in the first nine months of 2016. A decrease of approximately $20,000 in professional fee costs in the same period also contributed to the decrease in cost of goods sold and was largely due to decreased revenue for the first quarter 2016 combined with the hiring of an additional salaried employee in the second quarter of 2016 resulting in a reduced need for contract services, being partially offset by increased professional fee costs in the third quarter of 2016 for the reasons discussed above. These decreases in cost of goods sold and professional fee costs in the first nine months of 2016 were partially offset by increases in software amortization due to software purchases made during the period. Non-reimbursable project expenses and vendor costs also increased slightly during the period compared to the same period in 2015, in line with increases in revenues for the period.  

Salaries and wages decreased by $5,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 driven largely by a decrease in officer salaries expense of $89,000 partially offset by an increase in staff salaries and related benefits of approximately $56,000 and an increase in stock based compensation expense of $29,000. The decrease in officer salaries expense was primarily due to the capitalization of officer salaries for software development efforts during 2016. We hired additional staff in 2016 to assist with the delivery of our professional services and other tasks, which primarily contributed to the increased staff salaries and stock compensation expenses in the current quarter.     
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, salaries increased by $94,000 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the hiring of new employees in 2016 resulting in an increase of $31,000 and increased stock based compensation expense of $138,000 mostly due to the issuance of option grants to these employees. This increase was partially offset by capitalization of officer salaries for software development efforts in the first nine months of 2016.  

Contract services expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to decreases in corporate and investor relations, accounting, and marketing expenses in 2016.   

Other general and administrative costs increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in administration costs of $44,000 as well as professional fees of $27,000 mainly as a result of increased legal costs in 2016. We also recorded aggregate increased costs of $25,000 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter of 2015 across all of the following categories: computers and software, dues and subscriptions, insurance, rent, and repairs and maintenance. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales, marketing, and promotion expenses of $42,000 and $9,000 in travel expenses in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter of 2015.  

-15-

Other general and administrative costs increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase of $214,000 in professional fees associated with our listing on the TSX-V exchange and the closing of our private placement in February 2016, as well as the engagement of a new audit firm. Other increases include $73,000 in administration costs related primarily to human resource and recruiting expenses, investor relations, and license fees. There were also increases of $49,000 in sales, marketing, and promotion expenses, $15,000 in travel, meals, and entertainment expenses and increased aggregate expenses of $50,000 across all of the following categories: computers and software, dues and subscriptions, insurance, rent, and repairs and maintenance in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.  

Other expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to the net effect of fluctuating unrealized gains and losses associated with the revaluation of a promissory note from Canadian dollars to United States dollars in 2016.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  We measure our liquidity in a variety of ways, including the following:  

As at September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents and working capital had increased to $2,238,178 and $2,092,721, respectively, from $492,733 and $349,740 as at December 31, 2015. The closing of a private placement of our common stock in February 2016 for proceeds of $2,745,000 was the primary driver behind the increase in cash and working capital.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, we were able to finance our operations, including capital expenditures for infrastructure, product development and marketing activities with cash generated through operating activities, cash on hand, and the proceeds received from our private placement of common stock in February 2016.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements included in this report, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had a net loss of $862,252 and a net loss of $994,351 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
     
  We have had material operating losses and have not yet created positive cash flows. These factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Although we believe that sufficient funding will be available from operations, private placements of equity securities or additional borrowings to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months, our ability to continue as a going concern is entirely dependent upon our ability to achieve a level of profitability, and/or to raise additional capital through debt financing and/or through sales of common stock. We cannot provide any assurance that profits from operations, if any, will generate sufficient cash flow to meet our working capital needs and service our existing debt, nor that sufficient capital can be raised through debt or equity financing. The financial statements do not include adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  
     
    Anticipated Uses of Cash    
     
  In 2015 and the first three quarters of 2016, our primary areas of investment were professional staff to support our professional services and SaaS product delivery business, including client relationship management, and product development staff as well as investments in sales and marketing activities, such as sales and marketing staff, marketing and sales automation software and other related services.  
     
  For the remainder of 2016, we currently anticipate that our uses of cash will mirror the primary areas of investment for the first three quarters of 2016, including professional staff to support our professional services and SaaS product delivery business. Investments are anticipated to include client relationship management and product development staff as well as investments in sales and marketing activities such as sales and marketing staff, marketing and sales automation software and other related services.

Cash Flow   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
     
   Operating Activities.  Net cash used in operating activities increased to $582,459 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $512,891 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in cash used by operating activities was attributable primarily to a $212,359 increase in net losses combined with cash used in connection with increased accounts receivables and other assets, partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense as well as cash provided in connection with accounts payable and accrued interest in the first nine months of 2016.  
     
  Days Sales Outstanding ( DSO ), which the Company defines as the average number of days it takes to collect revenue once a sale has been made, decreased in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, DSO was approximately 33 days, down from approximately 44 days during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease mainly resulted from a lower accounts receivable balance at the end of the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter of 2015 driven primarily by increased collection of billings in the current quarter. DSO can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing and nature of contracts that lead to up-front billings related to deferred revenue on services not yet performed.  
     
   Investing Activities.  Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $417,096 compared to $43,460 in net cash used in investing activities for the same period in 2015. Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2016 primarily consisted of cash used for capitalized software development costs of $376,878 as well as payments for acquisition of intangible assets of $30,000 and equipment for $10,218.   
     
   Financing Activities.  Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $2,745,000 and $513,750, respectively. Cash provided in both years was the result of separate private placement of our common stock in each period.  
     
   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   
     
  We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016.
