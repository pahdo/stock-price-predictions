1.                    NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: 
    
  Nature of Operations 
    
  Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. is a diversified television broadcasting company with national reach with a strong focus on providing high-quality content on our local television stations and digital platforms. The content, distributed through our broadcast platform, consists of programming provided by third-party networks and syndicators, local news, and other original programming produced by us. We also distribute our original programming, and owned and operated network affiliates, on other third-party platforms. Additionally, we own digital media products that are complementary to our extensive portfolio of television station related digital properties. Outside of our media related businesses, we operate technical services companies focused on supply and maintenance of broadcast transmission systems as well as research and development for the advancement of broadcast technology, and we manage other non-media related investments.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our broadcast distribution platform is a single reportable segment for accounting purposes. It consists primarily of our broadcast television stations, which we own, provide programming and operating services pursuant to agreements commonly referred to as local marketing agreements (LMAs), or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to other outsourcing agreements (such as joint sales agreements (JSAs) and shared services agreements (SSAs)) to   173   stations in   81   markets. These stations broadcast   482   channels, as of   September 30, 2016  . For the purpose of this report, these   173   stations and   482   channels are referred to as  our  stations and channels. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) for which we are the primary beneficiary.  Noncontrolling interest represents a minority owner s proportionate share of the equity in certain of our consolidated entities.  All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Interim Financial Statements 
    
  The consolidated financial statements for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are unaudited.  In the opinion of management, such financial statements have been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of equity (deficit) and consolidated statements of cash flows for these periods as adjusted for the adoption of recent accounting pronouncements discussed below. 
    
  As permitted under the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures normally included with audited consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC.  The consolidated statements of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not necessarily representative of operations for an entire year. 
    
  Variable Interest Entities 
    
  In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE for financial reporting purposes, we consider whether we have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and whether we have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns that would be significant to the VIE.  We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary.  
    
  Third-party station licensees.    Certain of our stations provide services to other station owners within the same respective market through agreements, such as LMAs, where we provide programming, sales, operational and administrative services, and JSAs and SSAs, where we provide non-programming, sales, operational and administrative services.  In certain cases, we have also entered into purchase agreements or options to purchase the license related assets of the licensee.  We typically own the majority of the non-license assets of the stations, and in some cases where the licensee acquired the license assets concurrent with our acquisition of the non-license assets of the station, we have provided guarantees to the bank for the licensee s acquisition financing.  The terms of the agreements vary, but generally have initial terms of over   five   years with several optional renewal terms.  As of   September 30,  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, we have concluded that   37   of these licensees are VIEs.  Based on the terms of the agreements and the significance of our investment in the stations, we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interests because, subject to the ultimate control of the licensees, we have the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE through the services we provide and because we absorb losses and returns that would be considered significant to the VIEs.  Several of these VIEs are owned by a related party, Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation (Cunningham).  See   Note 7. Related Person Transactions   for more information about the arrangements with Cunningham.  The net revenues of the stations which we consolidate were   $79.1 million   and   $227.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   $71 million   and   $207.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The fees paid between us and the licensees pursuant to these arrangements are eliminated in consolidation.  See   Changes in the Rules of Television Ownership, Joint Sales Agreements, Retransmission Consent Negotiations, and National Ownership Cap   within   Note 4. Commitments and Contingencies   for discussion of recent changes in FCC rules related to JSAs. 

As of the dates indicated, the carrying amounts and classification of the assets and liabilities of the VIEs mentioned above which have been included in our consolidated balance sheets for the periods presented (in thousands): 

11 

     Table of Contents  

The amounts above represent the consolidated assets and liabilities of the VIEs described above, for which we are the primary beneficiary, and have been aggregated as they all relate to our broadcast business.  Excluded from the amounts above are payments made to Cunningham under the LMAs and certain JSAs which are treated as a prepayment of the purchase price of the stations and capital leases between us and Cunningham which are eliminated in consolidation.  The total payments made under these LMAs and certain JSAs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which are excluded from liabilities above, were   $40.0 million   and   $37.6 million  , respectively.  The total capital lease liabilities, net of capital lease assets, excluded from the above were   $4.5 million   for both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Also excluded from the amounts above are liabilities associated with certain outsourcing agreements and purchase options with certain VIEs totaling   $77.8 million   and   $72.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as these amounts are eliminated in consolidation.  The assets of each of these consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle the obligations of the VIE.  All the liabilities are non-recourse to us except for certain debt of VIEs which we guarantee.  The risk and reward characteristics of the VIEs are similar. 
    
  Other investments.    We have investments in real estate ventures and investment companies which are considered VIEs.  However, we do not participate in the management of these entities including the day-to-day operating decisions or other decisions which would allow us to control the entity, and therefore, we are not considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.  We account for these entities using the equity or cost method of accounting. 
    
  The carrying amounts of our investments in these VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are   $119.9 million   and   $18.1 million  , respectively, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.  The increase in   2016   was due to the adoption of the revised accounting guidance during the first quarter of 2016 related to consolidation as discussed under   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   below, which resulted in additional investments being considered VIEs.  Our maximum exposure is equal to the carrying value of our investments.  The income and loss related to these investments are recorded in income from equity and cost method investments in the consolidated statement of operations.  We recorded income of   $1.4 million   and   $2.8 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and income of   $0.7 million   and   $6.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   respectively.  
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
  America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and in the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on revenue recognition for revenue from contracts with customers. This guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance when it becomes effective.  The new standard is effective for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, however, early adoption is permitted.  The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance on disclosure of uncertainties about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. We will be adopting this guidance beginning December 31, 2016, which will involve adding policies and procedures around our assessments to continue as a going concern. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued new guidance that amends the current consolidation guidance on the determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity.  The new standard is effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  We adopted this revised guidance on a modified retrospective basis during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  As disclosed under   Other investments   under   Variable Interest Entities   above, the adoption of the revised guidance resulted in additional investments in real estate ventures and investment companies being considered VIEs, however, we concluded that we were not the primary beneficiary of these investments.  The revised guidance did not have any other impact on our consolidation conclusions. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for leases, which requires the assets and liabilities that arise from leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Currently only capital leases are recorded on the balance sheet. This update will require the lessee to recognize a lease liability equal to the present value of the lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for all leases longer than 12 months. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

assets and liabilities and recognize the lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This new guidance will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income tax effects, forfeitures, the impact of employee income tax withholdings and classification of certain related items in the statement of cash flows.  We early adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016, which did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  The adoption of the various changes in the guidance were applied as required by the guidance either on the prospective, modified retrospective, or full retrospective basis.  As shown in the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity, upon adoption, we recorded a   $0.4 million   increase to additional paid in capital and a   $1.8 million   decrease in accumulated deficit, net of taxes, to record the cumulative effect of changing the classification of certain liability awards to equity classification.  Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we reclassified   $2.2 million   from net cash flows from operating activities to net cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows related to cash payments made to taxing authorities on certain employees' behalf for shares withheld. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. The new standard, which includes eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice as to how cash receipts and cash payments are represented in the statement of cash flow. The new standard is effective for fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, including the interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Total revenues include: (i) cash and barter advertising revenues, net of agency commissions; (ii) retransmission consent fees; (iii) network compensation; (iv) other media revenues and (v) revenues from our other businesses. 
    
  Advertising revenues, net of agency commissions, are recognized in the period during which advertisements are placed. 
    
  Some of our retransmission consent agreements contain both advertising and retransmission consent elements.  We have determined that these retransmission consent agreements are revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.  Advertising and retransmission consent deliverables sold under our agreements are separated into different units of accounting at fair value.  Revenue applicable to the advertising element of the arrangement is recognized similar to the advertising revenue policy noted above.  Revenue applicable to the retransmission consent element of the arrangement is recognized over the life of the agreement. 
    
  Network compensation revenue is recognized over the term of the contract.  All other significant revenues are recognized as services are provided. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Our income tax provision for all periods consists of federal and state income taxes.  The tax provision for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is based on the estimated effective tax rate applicable for the full year after taking into account discrete tax items and the effects of the noncontrolling interests. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  In evaluating our ability to realize net deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including our past operating results, tax planning strategies and forecasts of future taxable income.  In considering these sources of taxable income, we must make certain judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage our underlying businesses on a long-term basis.  A valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets related to a substantial portion of our available state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, based on past operating results, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary book/tax basis differences, alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income. 
    
  Our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   approximated the statutory rate. Our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   was less than the statutory rate primarily due to 1) a reduction in liability for unrecognized tax benefits of   $5.7 million  , in the third quarter of 2015, as a result of statute of limitations expiration and 2) a   $3.3 million   adjustment to the income tax provision upon finalization of the 2014 federal income tax return, primarily related to greater than originally projected available income tax deductions and credits.

Share Repurchase Program 
    
   On March 20, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a   $150.0 million   share repurchase authorization. On September 6, 2016 the Board of Directors authorized an additional   $150.0 million   share repurchase authorization. There is no expiration date and currently, management has no plans to terminate this program.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased approximately   3.2 million   shares of Class A Common Stock for   $90.0 million  . For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we purchased approximately   3.6 million   shares of Class A Common Stock for   $101.2 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the total remaining authorization was   $154.3 million  .  In October and November 2016, we repurchased an additional   1.1 million   shares of Class A Common Stock for   $31.1 million  . 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year's presentation.

2.                    ACQUISITIONS: 
    
  Tennis Channel.   In March 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Tennis Channel (Tennis), a cable network which includes coverage of the top 100 tennis tournaments and original professional sport and tennis lifestyle shows, for   $350.0 million   plus a working capital adjustment of   $9.2 million  .  This was funded through cash on hand and a draw on the Bank Credit Agreement.  The acquisition provides an expansion of our network business and increases value based on the synergies we can achieve.  Tennis is reported within Other within   Note 6. Segment Data  .  
    
  The following table summarizes the allocated fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities (in thousands): 

The preliminary allocation presented above is based upon management s estimate of the fair values using valuation techniques including income, cost and market approaches.  In estimating the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, the fair value estimates are based on, but not limited to, expected future revenue and cash flows, expected future growth rates, and estimated discount rates.  The purchase price has been allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values.  The allocation is preliminary pending a final determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities. 
    
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we made certain measurement period adjustments to the initial purchase accounting: an   increase   to definite-lived intangible assets of   $45.6 million  , a   decrease   to indefinite-lived intangible assets of   $1.5 million  , a decrease to deferred taxes assets of   $16.1 million   resulting in a net deferred tax liability, a   decrease   to goodwill of   $25.3 million  , and an increase to amortization of   $1.1 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are comprised of trade names.  Customer relationships, which represent existing advertiser relationships and contractual relationships with MVPDs, will be amortized over the estimated remaining useful lives of   10   to   15   years.  Acquired property and equipment will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated remaining useful lives.  Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including assembled workforce and noncontractual relationships, as well as expected future synergies.  Goodwill will   no  t be deductible for tax purposes.  Other intangible assets will be amortized over the respective weighted average useful lives ranging from   1   to   3   years. The following table summarizes the amounts allocated to definite-lived intangible assets representing the estimated fair values (in thousands): 

In connection with the acquisitions, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred a total of   $0.2 million   of costs primarily related to legal and other professional services which we expensed as incurred and classified as corporate general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , net revenues

and operating income of Tennis were   $27.4 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net revenues and an operating loss of Tennis were   $62.5 million   and   $9.6 million  , respectively.   
    
  Pro Forma Information 
    
  The following table sets forth unaudited results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   2015   assuming that Tennis, along with transactions necessary to finance the acquisition, occurred at the beginning of the year preceding the year of acquisition. The pro forma results exclude the acquisition of television station acquisitions discussed below, as they were deemed not material both individually and in the aggregate (in thousands, except per share data): 

This pro forma financial information is based on historical results of operations, adjusted for the allocation of the purchase price and other acquisition accounting adjustments, and is not indicative of what our results would have been had we operated Tennis since the beginning of the annual period presented because the pro forma results do not reflect expected synergies.  The pro forma adjustments reflect depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets related to the fair value adjustments of the assets acquired, additional interest expense related to the financing of the transactions, and exclusion of nonrecurring financing and transaction related costs. Depreciation and amortization expense are higher than amounts recorded in the historical financial statements of the acquirees due to the fair value adjustments recorded for long-lived tangible and intangible assets in purchase accounting.   
    
  Television Station Acquisitions.   During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we acquired certain television station related assets for an aggregate purchase price of   $72.0 million   less working capital of   $0.2 million  . In conjunction with the acquisition of certain television stations, we simultaneously sold broadcast assets of certain stations.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized a gain on sale of those broadcast assets of   $1.8 million   and   $2.6 million  , respectively.  

3.                    NOTES PAYABLE AND COMMERCIAL BANK FINANCING: 
    
  5.125% Senior Notes, due 2027 
    
  On August 30, 2016, we issued   $400.0 million   of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a rate of   5.125%   per annum and mature on February 15, 2027 (the   5.125%   Notes), pursuant to an indenture dated August 30, 2016 (the   5.125%   Indenture). The   5.125%   Notes were priced at   100%   of their par value and interest is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing on February15, 2017.  Prior to August 15, 2021, we may redeem the   5.125%   Notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time at a price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the   5.125%   Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, plus a  make-whole  premium as set forth in the   5.125%   Indenture.  In addition, on or prior to August 15, 2019, we may redeem up to   35%   of the   5.125%   Notes, using proceeds of certain equity offerings. If we sell certain of our assets or experience specific kinds of changes of control, the holders of the   5.125%   Notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes.  There are no registration rights associated with the   5.125%   Notes. The net proceeds of the   5.125%   Notes were used to redeem   $350.0 million   aggregate principal amount of STG's   6.375%    senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the   6.375%    Notes) and for general corporate purposes.  The redemption price, including the outstanding principal amount of the   6.375%    Notes, accrued and unpaid interest, and a make-whole premium, totaled   $377.2 million  . We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $23.7 million   related to this redemption. We incurred   $6.6 million   of deferred financing costs in connection with the issuance of the   5.125%   Notes as of   September 30, 2016  .

5.875% Senior Notes, due 2026 
    
  On March 23, 2016, we issued   $350.0 million   of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a rate of   5.875%   per annum and mature on March 15, 2026 (the   5.875%   Notes), pursuant to an indenture dated March 23, 2016 (the   5.875%   Indenture). The   5.875%   Notes were priced at   100%   of their par value and interest is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, commencing on September 15, 2016.  Prior to March 15, 2021, we may redeem the   5.875%   Notes, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time at a price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the   5.875%   Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, plus a  make-whole  premium as set forth in the   5.875%   Indenture.  In addition, on or prior to March 15, 2019, we may redeem up to   35%   of the   5.875%   Notes, using proceeds of certain equity offerings. If we sell certain of our assets or experience specific kinds of changes of control, the holders of the   5.875%   Notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes.  There are no registration rights associated with the   5.875%   Notes.  The proceeds from the offering of the   5.875%   Notes, were used to repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and for other general corporate purposes. We incurred   $5.9 million   of deferred financing costs in connection with the issuance of the   5.875%   Notes. 
    
  As discussed in   Note 2. Acquisitions  , we completed the acquisition of Tennis in March 2016.  The acquisition was funded, in part, by a draw on our revolving line of credit which was repaid using the proceeds from the   5.875%   Notes discussed above.  
    
  Bank Credit Agreement 
    
  On July 19, 2016, we entered into an amendment and extension of our bank credit agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the maturity date applicable to   $485.2 million   in revolving commitments and   $139.5 million   of term loan A loans were extended to July 31, 2021.  The remaining   $153.5 million   of outstanding term loan A loans will mature April 9, 2018.  In connection with the transaction, we also amended certain pricing terms related to the loans. We incurred approximately   $2.6 million   of financing costs in connection with the amendment, of which   $0.3 million   was expensed and the remaining   $2.3 million   was capitalized as deferred financing cost as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was   no   outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $483.3 million   borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.  

4.                    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: 
    
  Litigation 
    
  We are a party to lawsuits and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Actions currently pending are in various stages and no material judgments or decisions have been rendered by hearing boards or courts in connection with such actions. After reviewing developments to date with legal counsel, our management is of the opinion that none of our pending and threatened matters are material. The FCC has undertaken an investigation in response to a complaint it received alleging possible violations of the FCC s sponsorship identification rules by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.  We cannot predict the outcome of any potential FCC action related to this matter but it is possible that such action could include fines and/or compliance programs. 
    
  Changes in the Rules of Television Ownership, Joint Sales Agreements, Retransmission Consent Negotiations, and National Ownership Cap 
    
  In March, 2014, the FCC issued a public notice indicating that it will closely scrutinize any broadcast assignment or transfer application proposing sharing arrangements (such as JSAs, LMAs and other shared services agreements) and contingent interests (such as options). We cannot now predict what actions the FCC may require in connection with the processing of applications for FCC consent to future transactions.  In addition, in August, 2016, the FCC completed both its 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews of its media ownership rules and issued an order which left most of the existing multiple ownership rules intact, but amended the rules to provide that, for JSAs where two television stations are located in the same market, and a party with an attributable interest in   one   station sells more than   15%   of the ad time per week of the other station, the party selling such ad time shall be treated as if it had an attributable ownership interest in the second station.  The order provides that JSAs that existed prior to March 31, 2014, may remain in place until October 1, 2025, at which point they must be terminated, amended or otherwise come into compliance with the rules. In addition, these "grandfathered" JSAs may be transferred or assigned without losing grandfathering status.  These new rules could limit our future ability to create duopolies or other two station operations in certain markets.  The revenues of these JSA arrangements we earned were   $16.0 million   and   $11.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $42.5 million   and   $34.2 million     for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

In February 2015, the FCC issued an order implementing certain statutorily required changes to its rules governing the duty to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. With these changes, a television broadcast station is prohibited from negotiating retransmission consent jointly with another television station in the same market unless the  stations are directly or indirectly under common de jure control permitted under the regulations of the Commission.   During a 2015 retransmission consent negotiation, an MVPD filed a complaint with the FCC accusing us of violating this rule. Although we reached agreement with the MVPD and they withdrew their complaint, the FCC undertook its own internal investigation regarding the allegations made by the MVPD and whether we negotiated in good faith as defined by the rules.  In order to resolve the issues raised by the investigation described above and all other pending matters before the FCC's Media Bureau (Bureau), the Company, on July 29, 2016, without any admission of liability, entered into a consent decree with the FCC pursuant to which the Bureau agreed (i) to terminate their investigation regarding the retransmission consent negotiations described above as well as any other investigations pending before the Bureau, (ii) to dismiss with prejudice or deny any outstanding adversarial pleadings against the Company pending before the Bureau, (iii) to cancel outstanding forfeiture orders issued by the Bureau relating to the Company, and (iv)  to grant all of the Company s pending license renewals, subject to a  payment by the Company to the United States Treasury in the amount of   $9.5 million   which was paid in September 2016.  In addition, pursuant to the terms of the consent decree, the Company agreed to be subject to ongoing compliance monitoring by the FCC for a period of   36 months  . 
    
   Further, in September 2015, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in response to a Congressional directive in STELAR to examine the  totality of the circumstances test  for good-faith negotiations of retransmission consent.  The proposed rulemaking seeks comment on new factors and evidence to consider in its evaluation of claims of bad faith negotiation, including service interruptions prior to a  marquee sports or entertainment event,  restrictions on online access to broadcast programming during negotiation impasses, broadcasters  ability to offer bundles of broadcast signals with other broadcast stations or cable networks, and broadcasters  ability to invoke the FCC s exclusivity rules during service interruptions.  On July 14, 2016, the FCC s Chairman announced that the FCC would not, at this time, proceed to adopt additional rules governing good faith negotiations of retransmission consent.  No formal action has yet been taken on this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and we cannot predict if the full Commission will agree to terminate the Rulemaking without action. 
    
  On September 6, 2016, the FCC released an order eliminating the UHF discount.   The UHF discount allowed television station owners to discount the coverage of UHF stations when calculating compliance with the FCC s national ownership cap, which prohibits a single entity from owning television stations that reach, in total, more than 39% of all the television households in the nation.  All but   28   of the stations we own and operate, or to which we provide programming services are UHF.  As a result of the elimination of the UHF discount, counting all our present stations and pending transactions, we reach over   37%   of U.S. households.  The changes to the national ownership cap could limit our future ability to make television station acquisitions.

  The following table reconciles income (numerator) and shares (denominator) used in our computations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods presented (in thousands): 

There were   525,000   shares for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   200,000   shares for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   which had an anti-dilutive effect on the equivalent shares outstanding and therefore excluded from the diluted effect above. 

6.                    SEGMENT DATA: 
    
  We measure segment performance based on operating income (loss).  Our broadcast segment includes stations in   81   markets located throughout the continental United States. Other primarily consists of original networks and content, digital and internet solutions, technical services and other non-media investments. All of our businesses are located within the United States.  Corporate costs primarily include our costs to operate as a public company and to operate our corporate headquarters location.  Other and Corporate are not reportable segments but are included for reconciliation purposes.   
    
  We had approximately   $226.5 million   and   $226.0 million   of intercompany loans between the broadcast segment, other, and corporate as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We had   $6.1 million   in intercompany interest expense related to intercompany loans between the broadcast segment, other, and corporate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . We had   $18.3 million   and   $16.9 million   in intercompany interest expense   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. All other intercompany transactions are immaterial.

  Transactions with our controlling shareholders  
    
  David, Frederick, J. Duncan and Robert Smith (collectively, the controlling shareholders) are brothers and hold substantially all of the Class B Common Stock and some of our Class A Common Stock.  We engaged in the following transactions with them and/or entities in which they have substantial interests. 
    
  Leases.    Certain assets used by us and our operating subsidiaries are leased from Cunningham Communications Inc., Keyser Investment Group, Gerstell Development Limited Partnership and Beaver Dam, LLC (entities owned by the controlling shareholders).  Lease payments made to these entities were   $1.3 million   for both the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $3.8 million   and   $3.9 million   for nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  In September 2015, we were granted authority by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate an experimental facility in Washington D.C. and Baltimore markets to implement a Single Frequency Network (SFN) using the base elements of the new ATSC 3.0 transmission standard.  In conjunction with this experimental facility, Cunningham Communications, Inc. provides tower space without charge. 
    
  Charter Aircraft.    We lease aircraft owned by certain controlling shareholders, including a new lease agreement as of February 2016 for the term of   thirty   months and will be renewed thereafter for successive terms of   twelve   months. For all leases, we incurred expenses of   $0.3 million   and   $0.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $1.0 million   for both the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation 
    
  Cunningham owns a portfolio of television stations including: WNUV-TV Baltimore, Maryland; WRGT-TV Dayton, Ohio; WVH-TV Charleston, West Virginia; WMYA-TV Anderson, South Carolina; WTTE-TV Columbus, Ohio; WDBB-TV Birmingham, Alabama; WBSF-TV Flint, Michigan; and WGTU-TV/WGTQ-TV Traverse City/Cadillac, Michigan (collectively, the Cunningham Stations). Certain of our stations provide services to these Cunningham Stations pursuant to LMAs or JSAs and SSAs.  See   Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  , for further discussion of the scope of services provided under these types of arrangements.   
    
  The estate of Carolyn C. Smith, the mother of our controlling shareholders, currently owns all of the voting stock of the Cunningham Stations.  The sale of the voting stock by the estate to an unrelated party is pending approval of the FCC.  All of the non-voting stock is owned by trusts for the benefit of the children of our controlling shareholders.  We consolidate certain subsidiaries of Cunningham, with which we have variable interests through various arrangements related to the Cunningham Stations discussed further below. 
    
  The services provided to WNUV-TV, WMYA-TV, WTTE-TV, WRGT-TV and WVAH-TV are governed by a master agreement which has a current term that expires on July 1, 2023 and there are   two   additional   5  - year renewal terms remaining with final expiration on July 1, 2033. We also executed purchase agreements to acquire the license related assets of these stations from Cunningham, which grant us the right to acquire, and grant Cunningham the right to require us to acquire, subject to applicable FCC rules and regulations,   100%   of the capital stock or the assets of these individual subsidiaries of Cunningham. Our applications to acquire these license related assets are pending FCC approval. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement we are obligated to pay Cunningham an annual fee for the television stations equal to the greater of (i)   3%   of each station s annual net broadcast revenue and (ii)   $4.7 million  . The aggregate purchase price of these television stations increases by   6%   annually. A portion of the fee is required to be applied to the purchase price to the extent of the   6%   increase. The remaining aggregate purchase price of these stations as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $  53.6 million  .  Additionally, we provide services to WDBB-TV pursuant to an LMA, which expires April 22, 2025.  We paid Cunningham under these agreements,   $2.1 million   and   $2.1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and   $6.6 million   and   $7.8 million   for nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
    
  The agreements with WBSF-TV and WGTU-TV/WGTQ-TV expire in November 2021 and August 2023, respectively, and each has renewal provisions for successive   eight   year periods.  We earned   $1.4 million   and   $1.5 million   from the services we performed for these stations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $3.9 million   and   $4.2 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
    
  As we consolidate the licensees as VIEs, the amounts we earn or pay under the arrangements are eliminated in consolidation

and the gross revenues of the stations are reported within our consolidated statement of operations. Our consolidated revenues related to the Cunningham Stations include   $29.4 million   and   $25.8 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $83.8 million   and   $74.8 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  During January 2016, Cunningham entered into a promissory note to borrow   $19.5 million   from us. The note bears interest at a fixed rate of   5.0%   per annum (the   5.0%   Notes), which is payable quarterly, commencing March 31, 2016. The note matures in January 2021, with additional   one   year renewal periods upon our approval. 
    
  In April 2016, we entered into an agreement with Cunningham to provide master control equipment and provide master control services to a station in Johnstown, PA with which they have an LMA that expires in April   2019  , Cunningham will pay us an initial fee of   $0.7 million   and   $0.2 million   annually for master control services plus the cost to maintain and repair the equipment.  Also, in August 2016, we entered into an agreement, expiring October 2021, with Cunningham to provide a news share service with their station in Johnstown, PA beginning in October 2016 for an annual fee of   $1.0 million   per year. 
    
  Atlantic Automotive Corporation 
    
  We sell advertising time to Atlantic Automotive Corporation (Atlantic Automotive), a holding company that owns automobile dealerships and an automobile leasing company.  David D. Smith, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has a controlling interest in, and is a member of the Board of Directors of Atlantic Automotive.  We received payments for advertising totaling   $0.3 million   and   $0.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $0.6 million   and   $0.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Additionally, Atlantic Automotive leases office space owned by   one   of our consolidated real estate ventures in Towson, Maryland. Atlantic Automotive paid   $0.3 million   in rent during both the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $0.8 million   and   $0.9 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
     
  Leased property by real estate ventures 
    
  Certain of our real estate ventures have entered into leases with entities owned by David Smith to lease restaurant space. There are leases for   three   restaurants in a building owned by   one   of our consolidated real estate ventures in Baltimore, MD. Total rent received under these leases was   $0.2 million   for both the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $0.5 million   for both the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  There is also   one   lease for a restaurant in a building owned by   one   of our real estate ventures, accounted for under the equity method, in Towson, MD.  This investment received   $0.1 million   in rent pursuant to the lease for both the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $0.2 million   and   $0.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Payments for services provided by these   three   restaurants to us was less than   $0.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

8.                    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: 
    
  Accounting guidance provides for valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost).  A fair value hierarchy using three broad levels prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  The following is a brief description of those three levels: 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
                
    Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions.

Other Events 
             
    In November 2016, we announced the following executive promotions and changes which will become effective January 1, 2017: David Smith from Chairman, President   Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman; Christopher Ripley from Chief Financial Officer to President   Chief Executive Officer; and Lucy Rutishauser from SVP Corporate Finance   Treasurer to SVP Chief Financial Officer   Treasurer.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The results of the businesses acquired during 2015 and 2016 are included in our results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition.  See   Note 2. Acquisitions   in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of acquisitions. Additionally, any references to the first, second or fourth quarters are to the three months ended March 31, June 30, and December 31, respectively, for the year being discussed. We have one reportable segment,  broadcast , that is disclosed separately from our other and corporate activities. 
    
  SEASONALITY/CYCLICALITY 
    
  Our operating results are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations.  Usually, the second and fourth quarter operating results are higher than first and third quarters  because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers. 
    
  Our operating results are usually subject to fluctuations from political advertising.  In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections.  Additionally, every four years, political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election.

Revenues from the investments were   $5.8 million   and   $3.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $15.0 million   and   $10.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Expenses, including other non-media expenses, general and administrative, depreciation and amortization and other income and expense items related to these investments in real estate ventures were   $4.2 million   and   $7.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $18.6 million   and   $14.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The year over year increase in revenue for both the three and nine month periods are primarily related to the sale of land parcels with real estate development projects. The year over year decrease in expenses for the three month period is due primarily to an increase in the gain on sale of real estate assets included within gain on the disposition of assets in the consolidated statement of operations, income from equity method investments, and partially offset by an increase in costs related to the sale of land parcels with real estate development projects.  The increase in expenses year over year for the nine month period is due to the increase in costs related the sale of land parcels with real estate development projects, equity method investment losses, partially offset by the gain on sale of a real estate assets included within the gain on disposition of assets in the consolidated statement of operations. 
    
  Investments in private equity.   We have controlling interests in certain private equity investments owned by Keyser Capital, which we consolidate; including Triangle Sign   Service, LLC, a sign designer and fabricator; and Alarm Funding, a regional security alarm operating and bulk acquisition company.  Revenues were   $17.8 million   and   $15.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $49.6 million   and   $43.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Expenses, including other non-media expenses, general and administrative, depreciation and amortization, and other applicable other income and expense items  were   $16.4 million   and   $12.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $43.5 million   and   $35.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increases in both revenues and expenses for both the three and nine month periods are primarily related to increased transaction volume from our alarm business. 
    
  Technical Services.   We own certain subsidiaries which service and support broadcast transmitters, and design and manufacture broadcast systems. Revenues from technical services were   $2.9 million   and   $2.1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenues from technical services were   $9.2 million   and   $8.4 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  Excluding research and development costs, expenses including other non-media expenses, general and administrative, depreciation and amortization, and other income and expense items related to technical services were   $3.2 million   and   $2.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and   $10.1 million   and   $8.6 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Research and development expenses.   Our research and development expenses relate to the costs to develop the Advanced Television Systems Committee's 3.0 standard (ATSC 3.0).   Research and development costs related were   $0.7 million   and   $4.8 million  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. These costs were   $3.1 million   and   $11.6 million  ,   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Income from Equity and Cost Method Investments.   Results of our equity and cost method investments in private equity investments and real estate ventures are included in income from equity and cost method investments in our consolidated statements of  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

operations. We recorded   income   of   $0.4 million   and   a loss   of   $0.5 million   related to our real estate ventures during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.    For the nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded   a loss   of   $0.1 million   and   income   of   $3.0 million  , respectively, related to our real estate ventures.   For both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, a $1.7 million gain on the sale of a real estate investment is included income. We recorded   income   of   $1.0 million   and   $0.8 million   related to certain private equity investments during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We recorded   income   of   $2.8 million   and   $2.3 million   related to certain private equity investments during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED EXPENSES 

Corporate general and administrative expenses.    We allocate most of our corporate general and administrative expenses to the broadcast segment.  The explanation that follows combines the corporate general and administrative expenses found in the   Broadcast Segment   section with the corporate general and administrative expenses found in this section,   Corporate and Unallocated Expenses  .  These results exclude general and administrative costs from our other non-media businesses and investments which are included in our discussion of expenses in the   Other   section. 
    
  Corporate general and administrative expenses combined   increased   by   $3.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase is primarily related to legal costs related to acquisitions, employee insurance claims, and an increase in compensation costs related to merit increases. We expect corporate general and administrative expenses to decrease in the fourth quarter of   2016   compared to third quarter of   2016  . 
    
  Corporate general and administrative expenses combined   increased   by   $9.6 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , when compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase is primarily related to legal costs related to acquisitions and an increase in compensation costs related to merit increases.  
    
  Loss from extinguishment of debt.    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a loss from the extinguishment of debt of $23.7 million related to the redemption of our 6.375% Notes in September 2016.  See   Note 3. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing   for further discussion. 
    
     Interest expense.    The explanation that follows combines the interest expense included within the   Broadcast Segment   with the interest expense found in this section,   Corporate and Unallocated Expenses  .  Interest expense increased during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to the issuance of our 5.875% Notes in March 2016. See   Liquidity and Capital Resources   for more information. 
    
  Income tax (provision) benefit.    The effective tax rate for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 including the effects of the noncontrolling interest was a provision of 34.7% and 34.6%, respectively, as compared to a provision of 14.3% and 29.3% during the same periods in 2015, respectively.  The increase in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, is primarily due to: 1) greater 2015 reduction in liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of statute of limitations expiration and 2) greater 2015 benefit resulting from the adjustment to the income tax provision upon finalization of the prior year federal income tax returns. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $104.5 million   in cash and cash equivalent balances and net working capital of approximately   $190.3 million  .  Cash generated by our operations and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement are used as our primary sources of liquidity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $483.3 million   of borrowing capacity available on our revolving credit facility.

     Table of Contents  

During August 2016, we issued $400 million in senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 5.125% per annum and mature on February 15, 2027.  The proceeds from the offering, were used to redeem our 6.375% Notes and for general corporate purposes.  See   Note 3. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing   in our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion. 
    
  In July 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Bank Credit Agreement that includes extended maturity of some Term Loan positions and more favorable rates.  See   Note 3. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing   in our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion. 
    
  During March 2016, we issued $350 million in senior unsecured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per annum and mature on March 15, 2026.  The proceeds from the offering, were used to repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.  See   Note 3. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing   in our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion. 
    
  We anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from our operations, and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital needs for the next twelve months.  For our long-term liquidity needs, in addition to the sources described above, we may rely upon the issuance of long-term debt, the issuance of equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for equity, or the sale of non-core assets.  However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital or buyers of our non-core assets will be available, or that the terms of any transactions will be acceptable or advantageous to us. 
    
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
    
  The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods presented (in millions): 

Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash flows from operating activities decreased during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This change is primarily due payments to extinguish our 6.375% Notes partially offset by an increase in cash received from customers primarily due to businesses acquired since   September 2015  . 
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

Net cash flows from operating activities increased during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This change is primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers primarily due to businesses acquired since   September 2015  , partially offset by payments to extinguish our 6.375% Notes. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This decrease is primarily due to smaller acquisitions in 2016 and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in investment in cost and equity method investments. 
    
  Net cash flows used in investing activities increased during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Tennis Channel. 
    
  In the   fourth   quarter of   2016  , we anticipate capital expenditures to increase from the   third   quarter of   2016  . 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash flows used in financing activities increased during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , is primarily due the increased repurchases of Class A Common Stock during 2016. 
    
  The change in net cash flows from (used in) financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in   2015  , is primarily due to the proceeds from the 5.875% Notes issued in March 2016. 
    
  In November   2016  , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share. Future dividends on our common shares, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on several factors including our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, covenant restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Other than the foregoing, there have been no material changes from the quantitative and qualitative discussion about market risk previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
    
  The term  internal control over financial reporting,  as defined in Rules 13a-15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, means a process designed by, or under the supervision of our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
                
    provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that our receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with authorizations of management or our Board of Directors; and 
                
    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. 
       
  Assessment of Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
    
  Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management s override of the control.  The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  We are party to lawsuits and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

  4.                  The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:
