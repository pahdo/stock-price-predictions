Note
A - Background and Description of Business   

BTHC
X, Inc. ( Company ) was incorporated on August 16, 2006, in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware.  The
Company is the U. S. Bankruptcy Court mandated reincorporation of and successor to BTHC X, LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company
which was discharged from bankruptcy on November 29, 2004.  The effective date of the merger of BTHC X, Inc. and BTHC
X, LLC was August 16, 2006.  

The
Company s emergence from Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code on November 29, 2004 created the combination of
a change in majority ownership and voting control - that is, loss of control by the then-existing stockholders, a court-approved
reorganization, and a reliable measure of the entity s fair value - resulting in a fresh start, creating, in substance,
a new reporting entity.  Accordingly, the Company, post-bankruptcy, has no significant assets, liabilities or operating
activities.    

On
May 21, 2009, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement ( Share Exchange Agreement ) with Sur-America Ventures,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ( SAV ), and the sole stockholder of SAV.  Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement,
the stockholder of SAV exchanged 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of SAV for 1,576,782 newly issued
shares of the Company s common stock that, in the aggregate, constituted approximately 90% of our then-issued and outstanding
capital stock on a fully-diluted basis as of and immediately after the consummation of such exchange. As a result of
this transaction, 1,751,980 shares of our common stock were then issued and outstanding.  

SAV
was organized on May 19, 2009 as a Delaware corporation and was formed to seek and identify a privately-held operating company
located in Latin America desiring to become a publicly held company with access to United States capital markets through a reverse
merger or acquisition transaction.  

On
September 18, 2009, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( SPA ), with Magellan Alpha Investments
Corp., a Marshall Islands corporation ( Magellan ) and Pierre Galoppi, the Company s then-sole director and
officer ( Seller ). Pursuant to the SPA, Magellan purchased from the Seller an aggregate of 1,576,782 shares
of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock. In addition, on October 9, 2009, pursuant to a subscription agreement
(the  SA ), the Company closed a transaction by which Magellan subscribed for an additional 4,087,953 newly issued
shares of the Company s common stock for $60,000 cash.  After the closing of both the SPA and SA (the  Magellan
Transaction ), Magellan then owned an aggregate of approximately 5,664,735 shares common stock of the Company and approximately
5,839,933 shares of the Company s common stock were then issued and outstanding. Magellan subsequently sold a
portion of its shares to certain third parties in a private transaction.  

The
Company is currently considering alternative business plans and focuses on locating and combining with an existing company, which
is profitable or, in management's view, has growth potential, irrespective of the industry in which it is engaged, desiring to
become a publicly held company with access to United States capital markets through a combination transaction with us. We
do not restrict our search for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or industry. However, the Company
does not intend to combine with a company which may be deemed to be an investment company subject to the Investment Company Act
of 1940.  A combination may be structured as a merger, consolidation, exchange of our common stock for stock or assets
or any other form which will result in the combined enterprises becoming a publicly-held corporation.

B - Bankruptcy Action   

Commencing
on March 28, 2003, BTHC X, LLC filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act in the United States Bankruptcy
Court, Northern District of Texas - Dallas Division ( Bankruptcy Court ).  The Company s bankruptcy
action was part of a combined case (Case No. 03-33152-HDH-11) encompassing the following related entities: Ballantrae Healthcare,
LLC; Ballantrae Texas, LLC; Ballantrae  New Mexico, LLC; Ballantrae Missouri, LLC; Ballantrae Illinois, LLC; BTHC I,
LLC; BTHC II, LLC; BTHC III, LLC; BTHC IV, LLC; BTHC V, LLC; BTHC VI, LLC; BTHC VIII, LLC; BTHC VIIII, LLC; BTHC X, LLC; BTHC
XI, LLC; BTHC XII, LLC; BTHC XIV, LLC; BTHC XV, LLC; BTHC XVII, LLC; BTHC XIX, LLC; BTHC XX, LLC; BTHC XXI, LLC; BNMHC I, LLC;
BMOHC II, LLC; BILHC I, LLC, BILHC II, LLC; BILHC III, LLC; BILHC IV, LLC; BILHC V, LLC.  

All
assets, liabilities and other claims against the Company and its affiliated entities were combined for the purpose of distribution
of funds to creditors. Each of the entities otherwise remained separate corporate entities.  From the commencement
of the bankruptcy proceedings through November 29, 2004 (the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization), all secured claims
and/or administrative claims during this period were satisfied through either direct payment or negotiation.  

A
Plan of Reorganization (the  Plan ) was approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas
- Dallas Division on November 29, 2004. The Plan, which contemplates the Company entering into a reverse merger transaction,
provided that certain identified claimants as well as unsecured creditors, in accordance with the allocation provisions of the
Plan, and the Company s new controlling stockholder would receive  new  shares of the Company s post-reorganization
common stock, pursuant to Section 1145(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the Plan s approval, all liens,
security interests, encumbrances and other interests, as defined in the Plan, attach to the creditor s trust. Specific
injunctions prohibit any of these claims from being asserted against the Company prior to the contemplated reverse merger.  

The
cancellation of all existing shares of common stock outstanding at the date of the bankruptcy filing and the issuance of all
 new  shares of the reorganized entity caused an issuance of shares of common stock and a related change of
control of the Company with more than 50.0% of the  new  shares being held by persons and/or entities which were
not pre-bankruptcy stockholders. Accordingly, per the Reorganization topic of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (Reorganization topic), the Company adopted  fresh-start  accounting as of the bankruptcy discharge
date whereby all continuing assets and liabilities of the Company were restated to the fair market value. The
Reorganization topic further states that fresh start financial statements prepared by entities emerging from bankruptcy will
not be comparable with those prepared before their plans were confirmed because they are, in fact, those of a new entity. For
accounting purposes, the Company adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with the Reorganization topic as of November
29, 2004, the confirmation date of the Plan.  

As
of November 29, 2004, by virtue of the confirmed Plan, the only asset of the Company was approximately $1,000 in cash due from
the bankruptcy estate.  

Note
C - Preparation of Financial Statements   

The
Company follows the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and retains the Company s
pre-bankruptcy year-end of December 31.

   Notes
to Financial Statements - Continued   

  September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Note
C - Preparation of Financial Statements - Continued   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Management
further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system
of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company s system of internal accounting
control is designed to assure, among other items, that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded;
and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly
the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented.  

Interim
Financial Statements   

The
interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s latest annual financial statement. The interim
financial statement disclosures may not repeat those in the annual financial statement.  

The
interim financial statements include all adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to make the financial statements
not misleading. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  

Note
D - Going Concern Uncertainty   

The
Company has no post-bankruptcy operating history and has a business plan with inherent risk. Because of these factors,
the Company s auditors have issued an audit opinion on the Company s financial statements which includes a statement
describing our going concern status.  This means, in the auditor s opinion, substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern exists at the date of their opinion.  

The
Company s majority stockholder has maintained the corporate status of the Company and has provided all nominal working capital
support on the Company's behalf since the bankruptcy discharge date.  Because of the Company's lack of operating assets,
its continuance is fully dependent upon the majority stockholder's continuing support. The majority stockholder intends
to continue the funding of nominal necessary expenses to sustain the corporate entity. However, the Company is at the
mercy of future economic trends and business operations for the Company s majority stockholder to have the resources available
to support the Company. Should we fail to obtain financing, the Company has not identified any alternative sources
of working capital to support the Company.    

The
Company's continued existence is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support its daily
operations as well as provide sufficient resources to retire existing liabilities and obligations on a timely basis. Further,
the Company faces considerable risk in its business plan and a potential shortfall of funding due to our inability to raise capital
in the equity securities market.   

The
Company s business plan is to seek an acquisition or merger with a private operating company which offers an opportunity
for growth and possible appreciation of our stockholders  investment in the then issued and outstanding common stock. However,
there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully consummate an acquisition or merger with a private operating
company or, if successful, that any acquisition or merger will result in the appreciation of our stockholders  investment
in the then outstanding common stock.  

The
Company remains dependent upon additional external sources of financing; including being dependent upon its management and/or
significant stockholders to provide sufficient working capital in excess of the Company s initial capitalization to preserve
the integrity of the corporate entity.   

Conditions
that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern has not changed from prior reporting
periods.

   Notes
to Financial Statements - Continued   

  September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Note
D - Going Concern Uncertainty - Continued   

The
Company anticipates offering future sales of equity in connection with a business combination. However, there is no
assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional funding through the sales of additional equity securities or, that
such funding, if available, will be obtained on terms favorable to or affordable by the Company.  

The
Company s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 40,000,000
shares of common stock. The Company s ability to issue preferred stock may limit the Company s ability
to obtain debt or equity financing as well as impede potential takeover of the Company, which takeover may be in the best interest
of stockholders. The Company s ability to issue these authorized but unissued securities may also negatively
impact our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our debt or equity securities.  

It
is the intent and belief of management and the majority stockholder to provide sufficient working capital necessary to support
and preserve the integrity of the corporate entity.  However, other than interest free loans of an aggregate of $288,882
as of September 30, 2016 provided by Magellan, no formal commitments or arrangements to advance or loan funds to the Company or
repay any such advances or loans exist.  There is no legal obligation for either management or the majority stockholder
to provide additional future funding.  

In
such a restricted cash flow scenario, the Company would be unable to complete its business plan steps, and would, instead, delay
all cash intensive activities. Without necessary cash flow, the Company may become dormant during the next twelve months,
or until such time as necessary funds could be raised in the equity securities market.  

While
the Company is of the opinion that good faith estimates of the Company s ability to secure additional capital in the future
to reach its goals have been made, there is no guarantee that the Company will receive sufficient funding to sustain operations
or implement any future business plan steps.  

Note
E - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

1.  
      Cash
    and cash equivalents   

The
Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.  

2.  
      Reorganization
    costs   

The
Company has adopted the provisions required by the Start-up Activities Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification whereby
all costs incurred with the incorporation and organization of the Company were charged to operations as incurred.  

3.  
      Income
    taxes   

The
Company files income tax returns in the United States and may file, as applicable and appropriate, in various state(s). The
Company does not anticipate any examinations of returns filed since 2006 or to be filed in future periods.

E - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued   

3.  
      Income
    taxes   continued   

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  At September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability accounts, as recorded when material to the financial statements, are entirely
the result of temporary differences. Temporary differences generally represent differences in the recognition of assets
and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes, primarily accumulated depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful
accounts and vacation accruals.  

The
Company has adopted the provisions required by the Income Taxes topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The
Codification Topic requires the recognition of potential liabilities as a result of management s acceptance of potentially
uncertain positions for income tax treatment on a  more-likely-than-not  probability of an assessment upon examination
by a respective taxing authority. As a result of the implementation of Codification s Income Tax Topic, the Company
did not incur any liability for unrecognized tax benefits.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the deferred tax asset related to the Company s net operating loss carry forward
is fully reserved. Due to the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 338, the Company may have limited net operating
loss carry forwards available to offset financial statement or tax return taxable income in future periods as a result of a change
in control involving 50 percentage points or more of the issued and outstanding securities of the Company.  

4.  
      Income
    (Loss) per share   

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the respective period presented in our accompanying financial statements.  

Fully
diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed similar to basic income (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased
to include the number of common stock equivalents (primarily outstanding options and warrants).  

Common
stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of the outstanding stock options and warrants, using the
treasury stock method, at either the beginning of the respective period presented or the date of issuance, whichever is later,
and only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based upon the Company s net income (loss) position at
the calculation date.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and subsequent thereto, the Company had no outstanding stock warrants, options or
convertible securities which could be considered as dilutive for purposes of the loss per share calculation.  

5.  
      Pending
    and/or New Accounting Pronouncements   

On
June 2014 the FASB issued an accounting standards update to topic 915  Development stage entities . The amendment
removes all incremental reporting requirements from US GAAP for development stage entities. The Company has complied with the
provisions of the update for the period ended September 30, 2016.    

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15  Disclosure about an Entities Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . The
update establishes management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entities ability
to continue as a going concern including related disclosures. The Company has complied with the provisions of the update for the
period ended September 30, 2016.

F - Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The

G - Acquisition of Sur-America Ventures, Inc.   

On
May 21, 2009, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with SAV and the sole stockholder of SAV. Pursuant
to the Share Exchange Agreement, the stockholder of SAV exchanged 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock
of SAV for 1,576,782 newly issued shares of the Company s common stock that, in the aggregate, constituted approximately
90% of our then-issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis as of and immediately after the consummation of
such exchange. As a result of this transaction, 1,751,980 shares of our common stock were then issued and outstanding.  

The
goodwill of approximately $4,500 arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies and access to new business contacts
that the management of SAV brings to the Company in order to more effectively implement the Company s business plan. Concurrent
with the Magellan Transaction, as previously discussed in Note A, the Company s management changed the Company s business
plan as established through the SAV transaction and, accordingly, charged the $4,500 in goodwill to operations on that date.  

The
following table summarizes the consideration paid for SAV and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized
at the May 21, 2009 acquisition date.

G - Acquisition of Sur-America Ventures, Inc. - Continued   

The
fair value of the 1,576,782 shares given in consideration for the acquisition of SAV was determined using approximately the average
of the transaction value of the shares of common stock of the Company issued at the date of the bankruptcy settlement ($1,000)
using both the initial number of shares (500,000) and the post-reverse split number of shares outstanding (175,198). There
were no contingent consideration arrangements and no contingent liabilities assumed by the Company. SAV had no operations
prior to the acquisition.  

Note
H - Income Taxes   

The
components of income tax (benefit) expense for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:  

As
of September 30, 2016, and after the Magellan Transaction, the Company has a net operating loss carry forward of approximately
$482,000 to offset future taxable income. The amount and availability of any net operating loss carry forwards will
be subject to the limitations set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. Such factors as the number of shares of common
stock ultimately issued within a three year look-back period; whether there is a deemed more than 50 percent change in control;
the applicable long-term tax exempt bond rate; continuity of historical business; and subsequent income of the Company all enter
into the annual computation of allowable annual utilization of any net operating loss carry forward(s).

The
Company's income tax expense for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:    

The
Company s only temporary difference as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, relates to the Company s net
operating loss pursuant to the applicable Federal Tax Law. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the deferred
tax asset is as follows:  

As
of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset increased by approximately
$6,727 and $6,451.  

The
Company's U.S. Federal and state income tax returns prior to 2012 are closed and management continually evaluates expiring statutes
of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings. The statute of limitations on
the 2012 tax year returns expired in March 2016.  

The
Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision and would
include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in the consolidated balance sheets. There were no interest
or penalties paid during 2016 and 2015.  

Note
I - Capital Stock Transactions   

Pursuant
to the First Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization proposed by the debtors and affirmed by the U. S. Bankruptcy Court - Northern
District of Texas - Dallas Division on November 29, 2004, the Company  will include the issuance of a sufficient number
of Plan shares to meet the requirements of the Plan. Such number is estimated to be approximately 500,000 Plan Shares
relative to each Post Confirmation Debtor. The Plan Shares shall all be of the same class.  As provided in the
Plan, 70.0% of the Plan Shares of the Company were issued to the Company s then-controlling stockholder, in exchange for
the release of its Allowed Administrative Claims and for the performance of certain services and the payment of certain fees related
to an anticipated reverse merger or other acquisition transaction(s) described in the Plan. The remaining 30.0% of
the Plan Shares of the Company were issued to other holders of various claims as defined in the Order Confirming First Amended
Joint Plan of Reorganization.

On
December 31, 2007, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation through the filing of a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate
of Incorporation with the State of Delaware for the purpose of effecting a 1-for-2.86 reverse split of its $0.001 par value common
stock.  This action was approved on November 29, 2007 by written consent of stockholders holding a majority of the Company's
outstanding common stock in lieu of a special meeting. As a result of the reverse split, the Company then had 175,198
shares of common stock outstanding. The effect of this action is reflected in the accompanying Statement of Changes
in Stockholders  Equity (Deficit) as of the first day of the period ended December 31, 2004.  

On
May 21, 2009, the Company entered into the Share Exchange Agreement with SAV, and the sole stockholder of SAV. Pursuant
to the Share Exchange Agreement, the stockholder of SAV exchanged 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock
of SAV for 1,576,782 newly issued shares of the Company s common stock that, in the aggregate, constituted approximately
90% of our then-issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis as of and immediately after the consummation of
such exchange. As a result of this transaction, 1,751,980 shares of our common stock were then issued and outstanding.  The
Company relied upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for an exemption from registration of these shares
and no underwriter was used in this transaction.  

On
September 18, 2009, the Company entered into the SPA, with Magellan ( Purchaser ) and Pierre Galoppi, the Company s
then-sole director and officer ( Seller ). Pursuant to the SPA, the Purchaser purchased from the Seller
an aggregate of 1,576,782 shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock and, concurrent with the execution
of the SPA, the Purchaser purchased an additional 4,087,953 newly issued shares of our common stock pursuant to the SA, for $60,000
cash. Immediately after closing of both the SPA and SA, the Purchaser then owned an aggregate of approximately
5,664,735 shares common stock of the Company and approximately 5,839,933 shares of the Company s common stock were then
issued and outstanding. These transactions closed on October 9, 2009. The Company relied upon Section
4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for an exemption from registration of the newly issued shares and no underwriter
was used in this transaction. The Purchaser subsequently sold a portion of its shares to certain third parties in a
private transaction.

statements. The Company disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions
to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.  

(2)
Results of Operations   

The
Company had no revenue for either of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 or for the period from November
29, 2004 (date of bankruptcy settlement) through September 30, 2016.  

Operating
expenses, including general and administrative expenses for the respective nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were $(44,844) and $(43,005) respectively. These expenses were directly related to the maintenance of the corporate entity and
the preparation and filing of periodic reporting requirements. It is anticipated that future expenditure levels may increase as
the Company intends to fully comply with its periodic reporting requirements. Loss per share for the respective nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were $(0.008), $(0.007), based on the weighted-average shares issued and outstanding
at the end of each respective period.  

It
is anticipated that future expenditure levels will remain in line relatively consistent until such time that the Company completes
a business combination transaction. Upon completion of a business combination transaction, it is anticipated that the Company s
expenses will increase significantly.  

On
May 21, 2009, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Share Exchange Agreement ) with Sur-America
Ventures, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( SAV ), and the sole stockholder of SAV. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement,
the stockholder of SAV transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of SAV in exchange for 1,576,782
newly issued shares of our common stock that, in the aggregate, constituted approximately 90% of our issued and outstanding capital
stock on a fully-diluted basis as of and immediately after the consummation of such exchange. As a result of this transaction,
1,751,980 shares of our common stock were then issued and outstanding.  

SAV
was organized on May 19, 2009 as a Delaware corporation and was formed to seek and identify a privately-held operating company
located in Latin America desiring to become a publicly held company with access to United States capital markets through a reverse
merger or acquisition transaction.  

On
May 28, 2009, the Company filed a certificate of compliance with reverse acquisition requirements, as required by the Plan for
a discharge from bankruptcy.  

On
September 18, 2009 the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) with Magellan Alpha Investments,
Corp., a Marshall Islands corporation ( Magellan ) and Pierre Galoppi, the Company s then sole director and
officer ( Seller ). Pursuant to the SPA and upon its consummation, Magellan purchased from the Seller an aggregate
of 1,576,782 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock that, in the aggregate, constituted 90% of our then issued and
outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis as of and immediately prior to the consummation of the SPA. Following consummation
of the SPA, Pierre Galoppi resigned as our sole director and officer.  

In
addition, on October 9, 2009, pursuant to a subscription agreement (the  SA ), the Company closed a transaction by
which Magellan subscribed for an additional 4,087,953 newly issued shares of our common stock, which newly issued shares constituted
70% of our issued and outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis following the consummation of the transaction contemplated
by the SA. As a result of these transactions, 5,839,933 shares of our common stock are issued and outstanding. Immediately upon
the closing of the SPA and SA, Magellan then owned an aggregate of 5,664,735 shares, or 97% of the issued and outstanding common
stock of the Company. Subsequently, Magellan sold an aggregate of 2,032,656 shares of common stock to certain third parties, thereby
reducing Magellan s ownership to 3,682,079 shares, or 63.05% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company.  

George
Syllantavos, our President, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director, is the President and majority shareholder of Magellan.  

The
Company is a shell company with minimal operations. The Company does not expect to generate any revenue or incur operating expenses
for purposes other than fulfilling the obligations of a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 unless and
until such time that the Company completes a reverse acquisition transaction with an operating entity.  

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had working capital (deficit) of $(455.198) and $(410,354), respectively.  

It
is the belief of management and significant stockholders that they will provide sufficient working capital necessary to support
and preserve the integrity of the corporate entity. However, there is no legal obligation for either management or significant
stockholders to provide additional future funding. Further, the Company is at the mercy of future economic trends and business
operations for the Company s majority stockholder to have the resources available to support the Company. Should such persons
fail to provide financing, the Company has not identified any alternative sources. Consequently, there is substantial doubt about
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  

(3)
Plan of Business   

General   

This
Company is currently considering alternative business plans and focuses on locating and combining with an existing company, and
which is profitable or, in management's view, has growth potential, irrespective of the industry in which it is engaged, desiring
to become a publicly held company with access to United States capital markets through a combination transaction with us. We do
not restrict our search for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or industry. However, the Company does
not intend to combine with a company which may be deemed to be an investment company subject to the Investment Company Act of
1940. A combination may be structured as a merger, consolidation, exchange of our common stock for stock or assets or any other
form which will result in the combined enterprises becoming a publicly-held corporation.  

The
Company does not expect to generate any revenue or incur operating expenses for purposes other than fulfilling the obligations
of a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 unless and until such time that the Company completes a transaction
with an operating entity.  

Pending
negotiation and consummation of a combination, the Company anticipates that it will have, aside from carrying on its search for
a combination partner, no business activities, and, thus, will have no source of revenue. Should the Company incur any significant
liabilities prior to a combination, it may not be able to satisfy such liabilities as are incurred.  

If
the Company's management pursues one or more combination opportunities beyond the preliminary negotiations stage and those negotiations
are subsequently terminated, it is foreseeable that such efforts will exhaust the Company's ability to continue to seek such combination
opportunities before any successful combination can be consummated. In that event, the Company's common stock will become worthless
and holders of the Company's common stock will receive a nominal distribution, if any, upon the Company's liquidation and dissolution.  

Search
for Business Opportunities   

We
are currently considering alternative business plans and focus on locating and combining with an existing company which is profitable
or, in management's view, has growth potential, irrespective of the industry in which it is engaged, desiring to become a publicly
held company with access to United States capital markets through a combination transaction with us. We do not restrict our search
for investment opportunities to any particular geographical area or industry and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business,
to the extent of the Company s limited resources. The Company s discretion in the selection of business opportunities
is unrestricted, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors. No assurance can be
given that the Company will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, and no assurance can be given
that any acquisition, which does occur, will be on terms that are favorable to the Company or its current stockholders.  

The
Company may merge with a company that has retained one or more consultants or outside advisors. In that situation, the Company
expects that the business opportunity will compensate the consultant or outside advisor. As of the date of this filing, there
have been no discussions, agreements or understandings with any party regarding the possibility of a merger or acquisition between
the Company and such other company. Consequently, the Company is unable to predict how the amount of such compensation would be
calculated at this time. It is anticipated that any finder that the target company retains would be a registered broker-dealer.  

The
Company will not restrict its search to any specific kind of business, but may acquire a venture, which is in its preliminary
or development stage, one which is already in operation, or in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. The acquired business
may need to seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other perceived advantages which
the Company may offer. The Company does not intend to obtain funds to finance the operation of any acquired business opportunity
until such time as the Company has successfully consummated the merger or acquisition transaction. There are no loan arrangements
or arrangements for any financing whatsoever relating to any business opportunities.  

Evaluation
of Business Opportunities   

The
analysis of business opportunities will be under the supervision of the Company s sole officer and director, who is not
a professional business analyst. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, management will consider such matters as available
technical, financial and managerial resources; working capital and other financial requirements; history of operations, if any;
prospects for the future; nature of present and expected competition; the quality and experience of management services which
may be available and the depth of that management; the potential for further research, development, or exploration; specific risk
factors not now foreseeable, but which then may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of the Company; the potential
for growth or expansion; the potential for profit; the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products, services, or trades;
name identification; and other relevant factors. In many instances, it is anticipated that the historical operations of a specific
business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future because of a variety of factors, including,
but not limited to, the possible need to expand substantially, shift marketing approaches, change product emphasis, change or
substantially augment management, raise capital and the like. Management intends to meet personally with management and key personnel
of the target business entity as part of its investigation. To the extent possible, the Company intends to utilize written reports
and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors. Prior to making a decision to participate in a business opportunity,
the Company will generally request that it be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity containing as
much relevant information as possible. Including, but not limited to, such items as a description of products, services and company
history; management resumes; financial information; available projections, with related assumptions upon which they are based;
an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing patents, trademarks, or service marks, or rights thereto;
present and proposed forms of compensation to management; a description of transactions between such company and its affiliates
during the relevant periods; a description of present and required facilities;, an analysis of risks and competitive conditions;
a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements; audited financial statements, or if they are not available at
that time, unaudited financial statements, together with reasonable assurance that audited financial statements would be able
to be produced within a required period of time; and the like.  

Management
believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the Company to
be attractive. These include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity
for current stockholders, acquisition candidates which have long-term plans for raising capital through public sale of securities
and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial, and acquisition candidates
which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility
of development of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process. Acquisition candidates, who have
a need for an immediate cash infusion, are not likely to find a potential business combination with the Company to be an attractive
alternative. Nevertheless, the Company has not conducted market research and is not aware of statistical data which would support
the perceived benefits of a merger or acquisition transaction for the owners of a business opportunity. The Company is unable
to predict when it may participate in a business opportunity. It expects, however, that the analysis of specific proposals and
the selection of a business opportunity may take several months or more. There can also be no assurances that we are able to successfully
pursue a business opportunity. In that event, there is a substantial risk to the Company that failure to complete a business combination
will significantly restrict its business operation and force management to cease operations and liquidate the Company.  

(4)
Liquidity and Capital Resources   

The
Company s majority stockholder has maintained the corporate status of the Company and has provided all nominal working capital
support on the Company's behalf since the bankruptcy discharge date. Because of the Company's lack of operating assets, its continuance
is fully dependent upon the majority stockholder's continuing support. The majority stockholder intends to continue the funding
of nominal necessary expenses to sustain the corporate entity. However, the Company is at the mercy of future economic trends
and business operations for the Company s majority stockholder to have the resources available to support the Company. Should
we fail to obtain financing, the Company has not identified any alternative sources of working capital to support the Company.  

Magellan
has loaned us (interest free) funds that were used to cover our expenses and provide us with working capital. The aggregate of
such loans amounted to $266,693 as of December 31, 2015 and $288,882 as of September 30, 2016.  

It
is the intent and belief of management and significant stockholders that they will provide sufficient working capital necessary
to support and preserve the integrity of the corporate entity. However, there is no legal obligation for either management or
significant stockholders to provide additional future funding and other than the loans described above, no formal commitments
or arrangements to advance or loan funds to the Company or repay any such advances or loans exist. Further, the Company is at
the mercy of future economic trends and business operations for the Company s majority stockholder to have the resources
available to support the Company. Should such persons fail to provide financing, the Company has not identified any alternative
sources. Consequently, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company has no current plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with respect to the sale or issuance of additional securities.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to the Company to allow it to cover its expenses.  

Regardless
of whether the Company s cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet the Company s operational needs, the Company might
seek to compensate providers of services by issuances of common stock in lieu of cash.  

In
such a restricted cash flow scenario, the Company would be unable to complete its business plan steps, and would, instead, delay
all cash intensive activities. Without necessary cash flow, the Company may become dormant during the next twelve months, or until
such time as necessary funds could be raised in the equity securities market.  

(5)
Critical Accounting Policies   

Our
financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective
interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported.
These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding
contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP
and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.  

Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note E of our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies
impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to
be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use
a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given
current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause
effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.  

Item
3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

In
future periods, the Company may become subject to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange
rates. At the present time, the Company has no identified exposure and does not undertake any specific actions to limit exposures,
if any.  

Item
4 - Controls and Procedures   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our certifying officer, who is our sole officer and acts as our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer (the  Certifying Officer ), has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2015.
Based on such evaluation, our Certifying Officer has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report,
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Controls  

There
were no significant changes (including corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our
internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
