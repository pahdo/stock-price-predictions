    This Sixth Amendment to License Agreement (   Sixth Amendment   ) is effective as of March 15, 2016 (the    Sixth Amendment Effective Date   ), by and between Augusta University Research Institute, Inc. (formerly known as Georgia Regents Research Institute, Inc. which was formerly known as Georgia Health Sciences University Research Institute, Inc. which was formerly known as Medical College of Georgia Research Institute, Inc.) (   AURI   ) and NewLink Genetics Corporation (   NewLink   ).  AURI and NewLink are sometimes referred to herein individually as a    Party    and collectively as the    Parties  .  
    
    WHEREAS, AURI and NewLink are parties to that certain License Agreement dated as of September 13, 2005, and amended on March 28, 2006, April 27, 2006, February 13, 2007, July 12, 2013, and July 10, 2014 (the    Agreement    and 
    
    WHEREAS, the Parties desire to amend the Agreement in accordance with Section 14.8 thereof;  
    
    NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained in this Sixth Amendment, the Parties agree as follows:  
    
           1. 
    All references in the Agreement to MCGRI, GHSURI or GRRI are hereby deemed to be references to AURI. 
       
           2. 
    The following definitions shall be added to Article 1 in the applicable alphabetical order therein: 
       
     Indoximod    shall mean the small molecule indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway inhibitor known as indoximod, or 1-methyl-D-tryptophan, having CAS Number 110117-83-4 and the chemical structure as set forth below, or any enantiomer, polymorph, salt form, base, acid, racemate, isomer, tautomer, solvate, or hydrate thereof: 

Indoximod Prodrug    is a medication or compound that is administered in an inactive or less than fully active form, and is intended to be converted to Indoximod [*].  For clarity, Indoximod Prodrug [*].   
           3. 
    The definitions of  Improvement  and  Licensed Product(s)  in Article 1 are hereby deleted and replaced with the following: 

Exhibit 10.08 
  [*]  Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed 
   separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

Improvement    shall mean any invention, that is conceived or reduced to practice in the laboratory of any Inventor (or of his/their collaborators) while employed at Augusta University, that relates to an invention claimed in or covered by the Licensed Patents or which is a modification of the inventions claimed in or covered by the Licensed Patents. 
   Licensed Product(s)    shall mean any process, service, or product, the manufacture, use or sale of which is covered by a Valid Claim, or incorporates or uses any Licensed Technology. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, for the purposes of Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6, an Indoximod Prodrug shall be deemed to be a Licensed Product with respect to activities in a particular country at a time when there is a Valid Claim in such country that covers Indoximod or the applicable use of Indoximod. For clarity, no payments will be due pursuant to Section 4.2, 4.3 or 4.6 for any activity (including sales made or milestone events achieved) involving an Indoximod Prodrug at a time when there is no Valid Claim in the relevant country that covers Indoximod or the applicable use of Indoximod or such Indoximod Prodrug.  
           4. 
    Section 2.2 is hereby deleted and replaced with the following: 
       
  2.2        Sublicensing  . Licensee and its Affiliates may sublicense to one or more third parties the rights granted under this Agreement, subject to the prior approval of AURI, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided, however, that no such prior approval is required for the grant of a sublicense after the Sixth Amendment Effective Date [*]. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, any such sublicenses granted shall remain in full force and effect and be directly enforceable by AURI. Licensee or an Affiliate shall provide to AURI a copy of any such sublicense and any amendment thereto, including all attachments, exhibits, and/or addendums, within [*] of execution; provided, however, such copies to AURI may be redacted to exclude confidential information of the applicable Sublicensee or of LICENSEE to the extent not relevant to AURI, but such copies shall not be redacted to the extent that it impairs AURI s ability to ensure compliance with this Agreement.  
           5. 
    Section 3.2 is hereby deleted and replaced with the following: 
       
  3.2        For as long as Indoximod is a Licensed Product, Licensee agrees to provide to AURI an annual report regarding Licensee s (or its Affiliates  or Sublicensees ) progress in Indoximod development outside of cancer.  AURI has the sole right to determine if non-cancer areas are receiving due diligence in Indoximod development in accordance with standards common to the industry, taking into account efficacy, the competitiveness of alternative products in the marketplace, the patent and other proprietary position of Indoximod, the likelihood of regulatory approval given the regulatory structure involved, the profitability of Indoximod and alternative products and all other relevant factors.  If Licensee has not met basic product development milestones with respect to Indoximod, and does not remedy that failure within [*] days after written notice from AURI, Licensee s right and license in Section 2.1 with respect to Indoximod in that area of the Field of Use (specifically, infectious disease or diagnostics) will revert from exclusive to non-exclusive for that specific application.

Such percentage shall decrease [*] for each year of the term of this Agreement in which Licensee expends at least [*] towards the development of Licensed Products, but not to go below a floor of [*].  The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as of the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, [*] is the applicable percentage for payments under this Section 4.2.  The Parties also acknowledge and agree that: (a) upon expiration of the last Valid Claim in the Licensed Patents that covers a particular Licensed Product (or Indoximod Prodrug if it is deemed to be a Licensed Product) in a particular country, LICENSEE s payment obligations pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall expire with respect to such Licensed Product or Indoximod Prodrug in such country;     and the license granted  pursuant to Section 2.1 with respect to such Licensed Product or Indoximod Prodrug in such country shall become fully-paid, perpetual and irrevocable, subject to AURI s retained license in Section 2.3 of this Agreement which shall remain unaffected; and (b) no payments are due pursuant to this Section 4.2 with respect to amounts received by Licensee or its Affiliate prior to the Sixth Amendment Effective Date pursuant to the [*] because [*].

  Royalties shall be payable on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis from first commercial sale of a Licensed Product in a country until the expiration of the last to expire Valid Claim of the Licensed Patents claiming the manufacture, use or sale of such Licensed Product in such country.     Upon expiration of such royalty term with respect to a Licensed Product (or Indoximod Prodrug if it is deemed to be a Licensed Product) in a particular country, the license granted pursuant to Section 2.1 with respect to such Licensed Product or Indoximod Prodrug in such country shall become fully-paid, perpetual and irrevocable subject to AURI s retained license in Section 2.3 of this Agreement which shall remain unaffected.  
           8. 
    The following is hereby added to the end of Section 4.6:  
       
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.6, to the extent any sublicensing fee payable to AURI pursuant to Section 4.2 is based upon a milestone payment with respect to a Licensed Product that is made in connection with an event that is substantially similar to an event requiring the payment of a milestone under this Section 4.6, LICENSEE will pay AURI the greater of: (a) the applicable percentage of such sublicensing fee pursuant to Section 4.2, and (b) the applicable milestone payment under this Section 4.6.  For clarity, AURI will be entitled to payment under either Section 4.2 or this Section 4.6, but not both, with respect

to any milestone payment received from a Sublicensee.  
           9. 
    The following is hereby added to the end of Section 12.1: 
       
  The license granted pursuant to Section 2.1 shall, with respect to the Licensed Technology, survive such expiration and become fully-paid, perpetual and irrevocable subject to AURI s retained license in Section 2.3 of this Agreement which shall remain unaffected.

    Section 12.8 is hereby deleted and replaced with the following: 
       
  12.8   Effect  . In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever, LICENSEE shall return, or at AURI s direction destroy, all plans, drawings, papers, notes, writings and other documents, samples, organisms, biological materials and models pertaining to the Licensed Patents and Licensed Technology, retaining no copies, and shall refrain from using or publishing any portion of the Licensed Patents or Licensed Technology as provided in Article 8 of this Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement, LICENSEE shall cease manufacturing, processing, producing, using, Selling, or distributing Licensed Products (other than those Licensed Products for which the license granted in Section 2.1 has become fully-paid, perpetual and irrevocable subject to AURI s retained license in Section 2.3 of this Agreement which shall remain unaffected); provided, however, that LICENSEE may continue to Sell in the ordinary course of business for a period of one (1) year reasonable quantities of Licensed Products which are fully manufactured and in LICENSEE's normal inventory at the date of termination if (a) all monetary obligations of LICENSEE to AURI have been satisfied and (b) royalties on such sales are paid to AURI in the amounts and in the manner provided in this Agreement. The provisions of Articles 9, 10, and 11 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.    
    
           11. 
    Exhibit A to the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with Exhibit A attached hereto. 
       
           12. 
    To the best of each Party s knowledge, as of the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, (a) such Party is not aware of any material noncompliance by Licensee with respect to Licensee s obligations under this Agreement and (b) such Party is not aware of any fact or circumstance that would permit AURI to terminate the Agreement or to provide a notice to Licensee of AURI s election to terminate the Agreement.       Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the Sixth Amendment Effective Date, Licensee fulfilled the obligations set forth in Section 3.1, and Licensee paid in full the initial license fee set forth in Section 4.1, and the milestone payments set forth in Sections 4.6.1.1 and 4.6.1.2 with respect to cancer. AURI acknowledges that as of the Sixth Amendment Effective Date Licensee has not previously provided AURI with annual reports regarding Licensee s (or its Affiliates  or Sublicensees ) progress in non-cancer areas of Licensed Product development as set forth in Section 3.2 of the Agreement and AURI hereby waives such obligation of Licensee prior to the Sixth Amendment Effective Date.  
       
           13. 
    In consideration of the modifications to the Agreement as set forth in this Sixth Amendment, NewLink shall pay AURI a milestone payment of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) within sixty (60) days of the Sixth Amendment Effective Date.

  Indemnification 
  9.1    Indemnification by NewLink.    NewLink hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless AURI, its officers, directors and employees and their successors, heirs and assigns (collectively, the    AURI Indemnitees   ) from and against all liabilities, damages, expenses or loss, including reasonable legal expenses and attorneys  fees, resulting directly from Third Party suits, claims, actions, proceedings and demands against a AURI Indemnitee arising from: (a) NewLink s or its Affiliates  or Sublicensees  research, development, manufacturing, use, marketing or sale of Royalty Bearing Products, practice of the Licensed Technology or use of the Test Results; or (b) NewLink s negligence, recklessness, intentional misconduct or breach of any obligation, representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or the Research Services Agreement. 
    
  9.2    Procedure.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.3(a): (i) with respect to an individual Royalty Bearing Product or country only, if the other Party s material breach giving rise to such termination right relates only to such Royalty Bearing Product or country, or (i) in its entirety only if such material breach fundamentally frustrates the objectives or transactions contemplated by this Agreement taken as a whole. 
    
    (b)      If the alleged breaching Party disputes in good faith the existence or materiality of a breach specified in a notice provided by the other Party in accordance with Section 10.3(a), and such alleged breaching Party provides the other Party notice of such dispute within [*] after receipt of such notice, then the non-breaching Party shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 10.3(a) unless and until (i) the dispute resolution process in Section 11.2 has finally determined that the alleged breaching Party has materially breached the Agreement and (ii) such Party fails to cure such breach within [*] following such final decision (or in the event that such breach is not capable of cure within such [*] period, fails to commence to cure such breach within such period and thereafter to prosecute such cure diligently to completion).

NewLink s obligation to make milestone and royalty payments to AURI pursuant to Section 4.2 and 4.3 with respect to PTEN Inhibitor Products will not be extinguished by an early termination of the Agreement (other than termination for AURI s uncured material breach) but will instead continue, on a PTEN Inhibitor Product by PTEN Inhibitor Product and country by country basis, until the later of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire Valid Claim within the PTEN Inhibitor Patents that covers such PTEN Inhibitor Product in the country in which the PTEN Inhibitor Product is sold and (ii) ten (10) years following First Commercial Sale of such PTEN Inhibitor Product in such country.

Research Services Agreement 
    
  This Research Services Agreement (   Agreement   ) is between Augusta University Research Institute, Inc. (   AURI   ) a non-profit research and educational corporation, located at Augusta University (   University   ), with principal offices at 1120 15   th    Street, Augusta, Georgia 30912-4810, and NewLink Genetics Corporation, with its principal offices at 2901 South Loop Drive, Ames, Iowa 50010 ("  NewLink  "). The parties may be referred to individually as    Party    and collectively as the    Parties  .  David H. Munn, M.D., shall serve as principal investigator (   PI   ) on behalf of AURI.  
    
  Introduction 
  During the term of this Agreement, NewLink and AURI will collaborate on a research services program for developing and executing   in vitro   and   in vivo   bioassays directed to further characterizing PTEN inhibitors identified by NewLink (   Research Services Program    
  NewLink has identified a need to conduct certain tests that: (a) require use of unique or special AURI skills, know-how and facilities that either do not exist elsewhere or are not readily accessible; and (b) involve specialized methods and know-how of a primarily technical nature (   Technical Tests    and 
  NewLink has determined that it cannot obtain equivalent Technical Tests from a commercial entity; 
  AURI has determined that AURI s performance of the Technical Tests is justified; 
  The Parties agree that the research services contemplated by this Agreement are of mutual interest and benefit to AURI and to NewLink, and will further the instructional and research objectives of AURI in a manner consistent with its status as a nonprofit, tax-exempt, research and educational institution; and 
  The Parties agree that the Technical Tests will be performed through a subcontract to University.  
  THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:  
    
  Terms and Conditions 
  1.            Performance of Technical Testing Services 
  1.1.        Technical Testing Services.    During the term of this Agreement, AURI shall develop and perform specialized assays, or shall develop the required techniques and help NewLink to perform such assays, as shall be required or desirable for the characterization of PTEN inhibitors.  These experiments shall be drawn from Exhibit A,    Technical Testing Scope of Work - Menu of Technical Tests   , as amended and updated throughout the course of the Agreement.  Exhibit A contains a general outline of the testing that may potentially be of use to NewLink; and this Exhibit shall be amended and updated before each Technical Test is first performed, to incorporate the actual agreed upon method for performing such Technical Test, to identify any Background Know-How (as defined in the License Agreement) to be used with respect to such Technical Test and to identify the types of Foreground Know-How (as defined in the License Agreement) anticipated to be generated with respect to such Technical Test.  Each set of experiments that is to be performed at AURI under this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon in advance and in writing by the Parties, on an experiment set-by-experiment set basis, with an agreed budget (supplies, costs, and personnel) developed for each set of desired experiments.  AURI shall invoice  

Exhibit 10.10 
  [*]  Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed 
   separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

NewLink for such experiments, and NewLink will pay the invoiced costs of the sets of experiments done at AURI, including associated facilities and indirect costs, in each case to the extent that such set of experiments has been satisfactorily completed and such costs do not exceed the budget therefor by more than [*], unless AURI obtained NewLink s prior written consent for such cost over-run.  For clarity, sets of experiments that are not mutually agreed upon and reduced to writing under this Agreement with an associated budget, are not required to be performed by AURI on behalf of NewLink.  AURI shall perform all work hereunder in a timely, efficient and professional manner in accordance with industry standards and applicable laws. 
  1.2.        Reporting and Ownership of Test Results.    AURI agrees to provide to NewLink, on no less than a quarterly basis or as otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing, written reports of Test Results and Foreground Know-How under this Agreement. Exhibit A shall be deemed updated to include all Foreground Know-How included in any such written report.     Test Results    shall include all data and results of experiments or other work performed by AURI under this Agreement, including raw data, blots, instrumentation printouts, graphs, tables, analytical data and observations.  Upon request by NewLink, AURI shall provide NewLink the original Test Results, and AURI shall be entitled to retain a copy thereof. NewLink shall solely own the Test Results; AURI shall assign and hereby assigns to NewLink all right, title and interest in and to the Test Results.  AURI will obtain all assignments necessary to effectuate such ownership. shall keep and maintain any AURI working notes and laboratory records associated with the experiments or other work performed by AURI under this Agreement in original form and, upon request by NewLink, shall provide NewLink or its designee with copies thereof and/or access thereto.  AURI shall not destroy such notes or records without first offering to transfer them to NewLink or its designee. 
  1.3.        Licensing.    Pursuant to the License Agreement executed concurrently with this Agreement (   License Agreement   ), NewLink has an exclusive license to Licensed Know-How and Licensed Patents (as    Licensed Know-How    and    Licensed Patents    are defined in the License Agreement), subject to AURI s right to retain a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use such intellectual property for its own noncommercial research and educational purposes and subject to AURI s additional retained rights with respect to the Background Know-How, as specified in the License Agreement. In order to facilitate the license by AURI to NewLink of Licensed Know-How, the parties agree that Exhibit A of this Research Services Agreement shall be deemed to also be incorporated into Exhibit A of the License Agreement at the time the design of a proposed experiment under this Research Services Agreement is reduced to writing and signed by both parties and that Exhibit A of the License Agreement shall be deemed to include all confidential Information (other than Test Results) identified in any report provided by AURI as having been generated by AURI pursuant to the Research Services Agreement.  
  1.4.        Interpretation and Analysis.   In no event will AURI be obligated to provide expert interpretation or analysis of Test Results under this Agreement, but if such interpretation or analysis is provided, it will be deemed to be Foreground Know-How or Licensed Patents (as applicable) and NewLink shall have an exclusive license and other rights thereto (including patent filing, prosecution and enforcement rights) as specified in the License Agreement. 
  1.5        Technical Contacts.   Each Party appoints the following individual to serve as its technical contact during performance of this Agreement. Each Party will notify the other of any change in the technical contact in accordance with the notice requirements of this Agreement. 
    For AURI:            David. H. Munn, M.D.  
    For NewLink:             Mario Mautino, Ph.D.   
  1.6.        Test Materials.   NewLink will furnish to AURI NewLink s proprietary compounds to be tested (   Test Materials   ).  If NewLink in its discretion provides AURI with any cell lines or other materials to be used in Technical Test, such cell lines or materials shall be deemed to be Test Materials.  AURI will

provide all other materials needed to perform the Technical Tests. AURI will exercise reasonable care in the handling and storage of Test Materials but will not be liable to NewLink for any loss of or damage to Test Materials unless such loss or damage is due to AURI s negligence or willful misconduct.  AURI will not provide the Test Materials to any third party or any person not directly involved in the performance of the Technical Tests, AURI will not use the Test Materials for any purposes except for the performance of the Technical Tests.  AURI will return all unused Test Materials to NewLink upon the completion of the Technical Tests or termination of this Agreement or, if earlier, upon NewLink s request.  The Test Materials shall remain solely owned by NewLink, and nothing herein constitutes a transfer of ownership rights, or grant of any other rights in the Test Materials to AURI. NewLink shall deliver the Test Materials to the following address: 
  Dr. David Munn           
  Augusta University Cancer Center, Room CN4141

Inventions    means those potentially patentable discoveries first conceived or actually reduced to practice by or on behalf of AURI in performance of this Agreement. The Parties anticipate that Inventions by PI are not likely to result from AURI performance of this Agreement. Inventorship shall be determined according to United States patent law.  However, if PI or another employee or agent of University or AURI conceives or reduces to practice any Inventions, then ownership of Inventions shall vest as follows: Inventions solely invented by PI or persons acting under the direction of PI or other employees or agents of AURI or University shall be owned by AURI; Inventions jointly invented by PI or persons acting under the direction of PI or other employees or agents of AURI or University together with  NewLink s employees, independent contractors or agents shall be jointly owned by AURI and NewLink  .    AURI shall obtain all assignments necessary to effectuate such ownership.  AURI shall promptly disclose all Inventions in writing to NewLink, shall provide all additional information reasonably requested by NewLink and shall provide all assistance reasonably requested by NewLink with respect to the filing, prosecution or enforcement of patents or patent applications claiming Inventions, which patents and patent applications are Licensed Patents under the Licensed Agreement.

  8.      Limitation of Liability; Liability to Third Parties; Representations   
  8.1.         Limitation of Liability.   Except with respect to indemnity obligatIons as set forth in SECTION 8.2 and to breachES of the confidentiality obligations AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 2, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other party for incidental, consequential, indirect, punitive or special damages arising out of or related to this Agreement, however caused, under any theory of liability, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. 
  8.2.         Liability to Third Parties.    
  (a) NEWLINK agrees to hold AURI and its trustees, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the    AURI Indemnitees   ) harmless from all liabilities, damages, and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, resulting directly from third party claims or demands asserted by third parties against a AURI Indemnitee arising from NEWLINK S use of the Test Results and/or Inventions. 
  (b)   To be eligible to be indemnified as described in Section 8.2(a), each of the AURI Indemnitees seeking to be indemnified shall provide NewLink with prompt notice of any claim (with a description of the claim and the nature and amount of any such loss) giving rise to the indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and the exclusive ability to defend such claim (with the reasonable cooperation of AURI Indemnitee(s)).  Each AURI Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel, at its own expense, if representation by the counsel of NewLink would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such AURI Indemnitee(s) and NewLink.  Neither the AURI Indemnitee(s) nor NewLink shall settle or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any claim for losses for which indemnification is sought without the prior written consent of the other (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided however, that NewLink shall have the right to settle or compromise any claim for losses without such prior written consent if the settlement or compromise provides for a full and unconditional release of the AURI Indemnitee(s) and is not materially prejudicial to any AURI Indemnitee s rights.  NewLink s obligation to indemnify the AURI Indemnitee(s) pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall not apply to the extent of any losses (a) that arise from the negligence, recklessness, or intentional misconduct of any AURI Indemnitee; or (b) that arise from the breach by AURI of any obligation, representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or the License Agreement. 
  (c)   AURI shall be responsible for its own acts in connection with this Agreement, including its negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct and its breach of any obligation, representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement.  
  8.3         Representation of AURI.   AURI represents and warrants that, pursuant to a written subcontract agreement between AURI and University, (a) as between AURI and University, AURI is the sole owner of all inventions, information, materials, data and results made, created, conceived or actually reduced to practice by or on behalf of AURI or University in pursuant to this Agreement and AURI has the right to grant to NewLink the rights and licenses thereto set forth in this Agreement or the License Agreement and (b) University is obligated to comply with AURI s obligations under this Agreement, including , but not limited to, AURI s confidentiality obligations under Section 2.
