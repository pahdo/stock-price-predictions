Tesla Motors, Inc.   
     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
 (Unaudited)  
   
 Note 1 - Overview of the Company  
 Tesla Motors, Inc. (Tesla, we, us or our) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy products. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America, Europe and Asia. The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to market, manufacture, sell and/or service our vehicles and energy products. 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 Public Offering 
 In May 2016, we completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 7,915,004 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. 
 Acquisition 
 On July 31, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SolarCity Corporation, which  designs, finances and installs solar power systems . Pursuant to the definitive agreement, each issued and outstanding share of the common stock of SolarCity would be converted into the right to receive 0.110 (the Exchange Ratio) shares of Tesla common stock.  SolarCity options and restricted stock unit awards would be converted into corresponding equity awards in respect of Tesla common stock based on the Exchange Ratio, with the awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to consummation of the Merger.  This acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt by each company, at a separate meeting of its stockholders scheduled to take place on November 17, 2016, of the affirmative vote of at least the minimum number of its non-interested stockholders as specified in the definitive agreement. 
   
 Basis of Consolidation  
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.   
 Use of Estimates  
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities and accompanying notes.  Estimates are used for, but not limited to,  determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the amortization period of these elements , residual value of operating lease vehicles, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of financial instruments, depreciable lives of property and equipment, inputs used to value stock-based compensation including volatility, expected terms of stock option awards and forfeiture rates, income taxes, and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
 Unaudited Interim Financial Statements  
 The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and other information disclosed in the related notes are unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods presented. The consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future year or interim period.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The new guidance provides a new model to determine when and over what period revenue is recognized. Under this new model, revenue is recognized as goods or services are delivered in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to collect.   In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , which clarifies the principal versus agent guidance in the new revenue recognition standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued an ASU,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which clarifies the guidance on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations in the new revenue recognition standard. In May 2016, the FASB issued an ASU,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedient  , which clarifies the transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes in the new revenue recognition standard.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017; early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method and are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
   
  In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and, if so, provide certain footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods thereafter. We do not anticipate that adopting this guidance will have an impact on the financial statements and are currently evaluating the potential impact to our footnote disclosures.  
 In April 2015, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We have retrospectively adopted this standard as of March 31, 2016, and as a result, on the December 31, 2015, consolidated balance sheet we reclassified $9.6 million as a reduction in prepaid expenses and other current assets, along with $15.0 million reduction in other assets, with a corresponding reduction in the aggregate carrying value of the Company s long term debt liabilities. Similarly, as a result of the change in carrying value of long term debt, $5.2 million was reclassified out of additional paid in capital and into mezzanine equity on the December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016 - 02,  Leases   (Topic 842) . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard will require lessees to report most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for existing leases, whereby the new rules will be applied to the earliest year presented. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
           In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718) :  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting    ( ASU   2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entitie  s, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230) .  ASU 2016-15 addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition   
 We recognize revenue for products and services when: (i) a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) pricing or fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. 
 Automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance including free internet connectivity, free access to our Supercharger network, and free future over the air software updates. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period, which is generally the eight-year life of the vehicle, except for internet connectivity which is over the free four year period. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third party pricing of similar options, and other information which may be available. 
 Starting in the third quarter of 2016, we started to separately present automotive leasing revenue and related cost of revenue. All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.  Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value guarantees. See  Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs  and  Vehicle Leasing Program  for further details.  
 Services and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services, service plans and merchandise, sales of pre-owned Tesla vehicles, sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, Tesla Energy products, and sales of non-Tesla vehicle trade-ins. 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had deferred $57.5 million, $84.7 million, $52.7 million, and $8.0 million related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and service plans, access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, and future software updates, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had deferred $53.6 million, $49.5 million, $32.4 million, and $2.7 million related to these same performance obligations, respectively.  
 Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs 
 Vehicle sales to customers with a residual value guarantee        
 Through June 30, 2016, we offered resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers who purchase vehicles and who financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, this program is available only in certain international markets.  Under this program, customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period for a determined resale value. Guarantee periods generally range from 36 to 39 months.  Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery, we are required to account for these transactions as operating leases.  The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised.  The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan.  We capitalize the cost of these vehicles to operating lease vehicles on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.    
 In cases when a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive leasing revenue. In cases when customers return the vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to pre-owned vehicle inventory. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $204.1 million and $136.8 million of the guarantees were exercisable by customers within the next twelve months.  
 10 

Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a residual value guarantee  
 We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners.  As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under  ASC 840 - Leases .  Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantees for the long-term portion and deferred revenue for the current portion.  We accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight line basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate.  We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenues during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement.  Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount, or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle.  Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive revenue.  In cases where the bank retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to costs of automotive leasing revenue .  The maximum cash we could be required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, is $742.0 million at September 30, 2016.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $1.0 billion and $527.5 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantees and $250.4 million and $120.5 million recorded in deferred revenue liability, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a total of $79.5 million and $33.6 million in account receivables from our leasing partners.  
 On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. 
 11 

Account activity related to our resale value guarantee and similar programs consisted of the following for the periods   presented (in thousands):   

Vehicle Leasing Program  
 We offer a leasing program in the United States, Canada, the UK and Germany.  Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla generally for 36 or 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenues. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had deferred $61.6 million and $25.8 million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded in automotive leasing revenue and were $31.4 million and $72.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Lease revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, were $11.5 million and $27.4 million, respectively.  

12 

Warranties   
 We provide a manufacturer s warranty on all new and certified pre-owned vehicles, production powertrain components and systems, and energy products we sell.  We accrue a manufacturer s warranty reserve which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserve in the future. The portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as current within accrued liabilities, while the remaining amount is classified as long-term within other long-term liabilities.  
 Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):  

Our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting, as costs to repair these vehicles are expensed as incurred. The warranty reserve increased primarily due to incremental vehicle deliveries, offset by actual claims and an overall decrease in accrual rates for vehicles, batteries, and drive units due to improved reliability. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, warranty costs incurred for vehicles subject to lease accounting were $7.2 million and $12.3 million, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, costs were $1.8 million and $6.0 million. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of automotive revenue and cost of automotive leasing revenue.    
 Inventory Valuation 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written off.  
 We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product. After inventory is written-down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.  
 Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.  
 Concentration of Risk  
 Credit Risk  
 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States. At times, these deposits and securities may be in excess of insured limits. We invest cash not required for use in operations in high credit quality securities based on our investment policy. Our investment policy provides guidelines and limits regarding credit quality, investment concentration, investment type, and maturity that we believe will provide liquidity while reducing risk of loss of capital. Our investments are currently of a short-term nature and include U.S. treasury bills.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our accounts receivable were derived primarily from amounts to be received from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of regulatory credits, as well as the development and sales of powertrain components and systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).   As of September 30, 2016, we have two customers who individually account for 17% and 14% of our accounts receivable, respectively.   
 13 

Supply Risk   
 The majority of our suppliers are currently single source suppliers, despite efforts to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever feasible.  The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to vehicle design changes, increased costs and delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative publicity, damage to our brand and a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.   
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to employees and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock options and ESPP are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the service period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. 
 For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable. 
 For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the implicit or derived service period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met. 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 In  November 2015, we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in Japanese yen.  The derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 months or less. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.    
 The bank counterparties in all contracts expose Tesla to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, Tesla only contracts with counterparties who meet the Company s minimum requirements under its counterparty risk assessment process. Tesla monitors ratings, credit spreads, and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, the Company will adjust its exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. 
 Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, net of any reclassifications, our available-for-sale marketable securities, and foreign currency translation adjustment that have been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).  
 Net Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock    
 Our basic and diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the number of shares underlying outstanding stock options and warrants as well as our convertible senior notes, are not included when their effect is antidilutive.  
 14 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts):  

The following table presents the potential weighted common shares outstanding that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock for the periods presented: 

Since we expect to settle the principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes in cash, we use the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of our common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $124.52, $359.87 and $359.87 per share for the convertible senior notes due 2018 (2018 Notes), convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes), and convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes).  
 Income Taxes  
 There are transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate balances of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $162.8 million and $99.3 million. $158.1 million and $95.7 million of these aggregate balances would not give rise to changes in our effective tax rate since these tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which is currently offset by a full valuation allowance.  

Note 3 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we follow a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities.  
 15 

All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market pri  ces or market prices for identical securities. Our restricted short-term marketable securities are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy.   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets that are carried at fair value was as follows (in thousands), and unrealized gains (losses) on all financial assets for all periods presented were less than $1.0 million: 

As of September 30 , 2016 , the estimated fair value of our 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes was $363.0 million (par value $224.3 million), $834.9 million (par value $920.0 million), and $1.19 billion (par value $1.38 billion). As of December 31, 2015 the estimated fair value of our 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes was $1.29 billion (par value $659.8 million), $864.8 million (par value $920.0 million), and $1.27 billion (par value $1.38 billion). These fair values represent Level II valuations. When determining the estimated fair value of our long-term debt, we used a commonly accepted valuation methodology and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk.  As of September 30, 2016, the $ 200  million carrying value of our Credit Agreement liability and $300 million carrying value under our Warehouse Agreement approximates the fair value of the borrowings based upon the borrowing rate available to us for debt with similar terms and consideration of credit and default risk using Level II inputs.   
   
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 In November 2015, we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in Japanese yen. The derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 months or less. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 
 We document each hedge relationship and assess its initial effectiveness at the inception of the hedge contract and we measure its ongoing effectiveness on a quarterly basis using regression analysis. During the term of an effective hedge contract, we record gains and losses within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We reclassify these gains or losses to cost of automotive revenue in the period the related finished goods inventory is sold to cost of automotive leasing revenue or over the depreciation period for those sales accounted for as leases. Although our contracts are considered effective hedges, we may experience small amounts of ineffectiveness due to timing differences between our actual inventory purchases and the settlement date of the related foreign currency forward contracts. Ineffectiveness related to the hedges is immaterial as of September 30, 2016.  
   
 The net notional amount of these contracts was $95.4 million at September 30, 2016. Outstanding contracts are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets or within accrued liabilities, depending on our net position. The cumulative gain of $40.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 30, 2016 is expected to be recognized within cost of automotive revenue in the next twelve months. The total fair values of foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2016 is $19.2  million and was determined using Level II inputs and recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $14.2 million and $15.5 million has been reclassified to costs of automotive revenue. 

Note 4 - Inventory  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our inventory consisted of the following (in thousands):  

16 

Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer orders, new vehicles available for immediate sale at our retail and service center locations, pre-owned Tesla vehicles, and energy products. The increase in finished goods is primarily due to 97% more vehicles in transit to customers as of September 30, 2016.  

Note 5 - Property, Plant and Equipment  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our property, plant and equipment, net, consisted of the following (in thousands):  

Construction in progress is comprised primarily of tooling and equipment related to the manufacturing of vehicles, a portion of Gigafactory construction, and related capitalized interest. Completed assets are transferred to their respective asset class and depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in progress is included in property, plant and equipment, net, and is amortized over the life of the related assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we capitalized $11.4 million and $30.4 million of interest expense. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we capitalized $11.8 million and $32.4 million of interest expense, respectively.   
 We are sometimes involved in construction at our leased facilities primarily related to retail stores, service centers, and certain manufacturing facilities. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 840,  Leases , for build-to-suit lease arrangements where we are involved in the construction of structural improvements prior to the commencement of the lease or take some level of construction risk, we are considered the owner of the assets and land during the construction period. Accordingly, upon commencement of our construction activities, we record a construction in progress asset and a corresponding financing liability. Once the construction is completed, if the lease meets certain  sale-leaseback  criteria, we will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease. If upon completion of construction, the project does not meet the  sale-leaseback  criteria, the leased property will be treated as a capital lease and included in building and building improvements in the table above. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the table above includes $443.1 million and $206.1 million of build-to-suit assets. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, corresponding financing obligations of $2.6 million and $1.3 million are recorded in accrued liabilities and $454.2 million and $201.3 million are recorded in other long-term liabilities.  
   
 Depreciation and amortization expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $126.8 million and $337.9 million. Depreciation and amortization expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was $71.8 million and $184.7 million. Total property and equipment assets under capital lease as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $80.5 million and $58.1 million. Accumulated depreciation related to assets under capital lease as of these dates were $36.1 million and $22.7 million.  
 We have incurred $608.4 million of costs for our Gigafactory as of September 30, 2016. 

17 

Note 6 - Accrued L  iabilities  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our accrued liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):  

Taxes payable includes Value Added Tax, sales tax, property tax, and income tax payables.   
 Accrued purchases reflects primarily liabilities related to the construction of the Gigafactory along with engineering design and testing accruals. As these services are invoiced, this balance will reduce and accounts payable will increase.  

Note 7 - Customer Deposits  
 Customer deposits include cash payments from customers at the time they place an order for a vehicle and additional payments up to the point of delivery including the fair value of customer trade-in vehicles that are applicable toward a new vehicle purchase. Customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery. Customer deposits are fully refundable up to the point the vehicle is placed into the production cycle. Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied to a customer s purchase balance at time of delivery.   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we held customer deposits of $690.4 million and $283.4 million.  The increase is primarily due to Model 3 deposits.   

Note 8 - Convertible and Long-term Debt Obligations  
 0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions  
 In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering.  The total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion from 2021 Notes. We incurred $14.2 million and $21.4 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of these notes. In April 2015, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which we retrospectively adopted as of March 31, 2016 and reclassified debt issuance costs in connection with the notes to related debt liability. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014.     
 18 

Each $1,000 of principal   of these notes is initially convertible into 2.7788 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of these notes ma  y convert their notes at their option on or after December 1, 2018 for the 2019 Notes and on or after December 1, 2020 for the 2021 Notes. Further, holders of these notes may convert their notes at their option prior to the respective dates above, only und  er the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2014, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecut  ive trading days of immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the applicable notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day per  iod in which the trading price for the applicable notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing sale price of our common stock for each day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock   or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, we would pay or deliver as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. Upon conversion of the 2021   Notes, we would pay the holders in cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily conversion value. If a fu  ndamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.   In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. During the third   quarter of 2016, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other conditions   allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of September 30, 2016. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible during the fourth quarter of 2016 and are classified as long-term debt. Should the closing price conditions be m  et in a future quarter, the 2019 and/or the 2021 Notes will be convertible at their holders  option during the immediately following quarter. As of September 30, 2016, the if-converted value of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes did not exceed the principal val  ue of those notes.  
 In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the notes from the respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option of $188.1 million for the 2019 Notes and $369.4 million for the 2021 Notes in stockholders  equity. The resulting debt discounts on the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.89% and 5.96%, respectively, over the contractual terms of the notes.  
 In connection with the offering of these notes in March 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $359.87 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $524.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 for the 2019 Notes and a total of approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for 2021 Notes. We received $338.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Similarly, in connection with the issuance of additional notes in April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and paid an aggregate $78.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 per share for the warrants relating to 2019 Notes, and a total of approximately 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for the warrants relating to 2021 Notes. We received aggregate proceeds of approximately $50.8 million from the sale of the warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments upon the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $359.87 to $512.66 per share in the case of warrants relating to 2019 Notes and from $359.87 to $560.64 in the case of warrants relating to 2021 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders  equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. 
   
 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions  
 In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. We incurred $12.0 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the 2018 Notes. The interest under the 2018 Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013. 
 19 

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2018 Notes is initially convertible into 8.0306 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $124.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of s  pecified events. Holders of the 2018 Notes may convert their 2018 Notes at their option on or after March 1, 2018. Further, holders of the 2018 Notes may convert their 2018 Notes at their option prior to March 1, 2018, only under the following circumstance  s: (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2013, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the   immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2018   Notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing sale price of our common stock for each day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upo  n conversion, we would pay the holders in cash for the principal amount of the 2018 Notes and, if applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a calcul  ated daily conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2018 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2018 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the   2018 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2018 Notes in connection with such a corporate event i  n certain circumstances.  
   
 In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the 2018 Notes from the host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of $82.8 million in stockholders  equity. The resulting debt discount on the 2018 Notes is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.29% over the contractual term of the 2018 Notes. 
   
 In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially (subject to certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $124.52 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $177.5 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $184.48 per share. We received $120.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2018 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders  equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. 
   
 During first three quarters of fiscal 2016, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. As such, we classified the $213.0 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes as current liabilities and classified $11.3 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2018 Notes of $224.3 million and the carrying value of 2018 Notes, as mezzanine equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. Should the closing price conditions be met in a future quarter, 2018 Notes will be convertible at their holders  option during the immediately following quarter. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repaid $421.8 million and $435.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2018 Notes pursuant to conversions by their holders.  As of September 30, 2016, we had remaining outstanding $224.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes. As of September 30, 2016, there were also outstanding a corresponding amount of convertible note hedge transactions, as well as warrants to issue up to 2.2 million shares at $184.48 per share as of September 30, 2016, in each case issued in connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes.

Convertible Senior Notes Carrying Value and Interest E  xpense   
 In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the Notes from the respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option for the 2018, 2019, and 2021 Notes in stockholders  equity. The resulting debt discounts on the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes are being amortized to interest expense at the effective interest rate over the contractual terms of the Notes.  

Asset-Based Credit Agreement 
   
 In June 2015, we entered into a senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ), which we may draw upon as needed. In October 2015, lenders increased their total funding commitments to us under the Credit Facility by up to an additional $250.0 million, subject to certain conditions, for total commitments up to $750 million. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for a $200.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $40.0 million swing-line loan sub-facility. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by a pledge of certain of our accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment, and availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves. In February 2016, we amended the Credit Agreement and increased the availability and the commitments under the Credit Agreement from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion. 
   
 Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders  prime rate  or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly. The Credit Agreement terminates, and all outstanding loans become due and payable, in June 2020.  As of September 30, 2016, we had $200.0 million in borrowings under the Credit Facility and zero borrowings under the swing-line loan sub-facility.   
   
 We are required to meet various covenants, including meeting certain reporting requirements, such as the completion and presentation of audited consolidated financial statements for our borrowings. As of September 30, 2016 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.  
   
 Loan and Security Agreement 
 On August 31, 2016, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the  Warehouse Agreement ) with Deutsche Bank as administrative agent and a committed lender.  Under the Warehouse Agreement, which will support the Tesla Finance direct vehicle leasing program, and is secured by an interest in certain leases and vehicles under such program, we may borrow up to $300.0 million in total principal amount. Subject to extension in accordance with the terms of the Warehouse Agreement, the ability to draw under the Warehouse Agreement expires on August 31, 2017, and the full amount outstanding under the Warehouse Agreement is due September 20, 2018. As of September 30, 2016, we had $300.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Warehouse Agreement. 
 Amounts drawn under the Warehouse Agreement generally bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin. We are subject to various customary events of default and financial, lease portfolio performance and other covenants and limitations, including an advance rate limit, a required reserve account,  and various performance triggers and excess concentration limits. 
 Pledged Assets 
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we have pledged or restricted $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion principally from finished goods and raw materials inventory, as well as certain property and equipment, direct lease vehicles, receivables and cash as collateral for letters of credit including our Credit Agreement, real estate leases, and insurance policies. 
 21 

Interest Expense  
 The following table presents the aggregate amount of interest expense recognized on a prior secured credit facility to support our direct leasing program, which was terminated in December 2015, the Credit Agreement, the Warehouse Agreement, the 2018 Notes, the 2019 Notes, and the 2021 Notes relating to the contractual interest coupon and amortization of the debt issuance costs and debt discount (in thousands):  

Note 9 - Equity Incentive Plans  
 In  July 2003, we adopted the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Concurrent with the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on June 28, 2010, we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan) and all remaining common shares reserved for future grant or issuance under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan were added to the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. The Plan provides for the granting of stock options, RSUs and stock purchase rights to our employees, directors and consultants. Options granted under the Plan may be either incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options may be granted only to our employees including officers and directors. Nonqualified stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted to our employees and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and are exercisable over a period not to exceed the contractual term of ten years from the date the stock options are granted. Continued vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends. As of September 30, 2016, there were 15,483,680 shares of outstanding stock awards under the Plan. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 645,553 and 2,816,785 shares were available for grant relating to stock options and RSUs.  
   
 Performance-based Stock Option Grant  
 In 2014, to create incentives for continued long term success beyond the Model S program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders  interests in the achievement of significant milestones by our Company, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted stock options to certain employees to purchase an aggregate 1,073,000 shares of our common stock. Each such grant consists of four vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of future performance milestones, assuming continued employment and service to us through each vesting date.  

1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle;      

1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon achieving aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period;      

1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle; and      

1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon achievement of annualized gross margin of greater than 30.0% in any three years.     

 As of September 30, 2016, the following performance milestone was achieved and approved by our Board of Directors.     

Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle      

 As of September 30, 2016, the following performance milestone was considered probable of achievement. 

Completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle; and      

We begin recording stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes probable. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $11.6 million and $22.8 million related to this grant. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million and $10.4 million related to this grant.  
 22 

2012 CEO Grant   
 In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock options to our CEO (2012 CEO Grant). The 2012 CEO Grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service to us through each vesting date.  
 Each of the ten vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten pre-determined performance milestones and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of $4.0 billion, as compared to the initial market capitalization of $3.2 billion measured at the time of the 2012 CEO Grant.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the market conditions for seven vesting tranches and the following five performance milestones were achieved and approved by our Board of Directors:  

Successful completion of the Model X Alpha Prototype;      

Successful completion of the Model X Beta Prototype;     

Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle;     

Successful completion of the Model 3 Alpha Prototype.      

 As of September 30, 2016, the following performance milestones were considered probable of achievement:  

Successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype;     

Completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle;     

We begin recording stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes probable. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $4.6 million for the three months period ended September 30, 2016 and $14.9 million for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 related to this grant. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $6.8 million and $9.5 million related to this grant. 
 Our CEO earns a base salary that reflects the currently applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he is subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted and currently does not accept his salary.

In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act   of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint made claims against Tesla and our CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney s fees on the basis of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr. Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions,   including with respect to the safety of Model S. This case was brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. On September 26, 2014, the trial court, upon   the motion of Tesla and Mr. Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and thereafter issued a formal written order to that effect. The plaintiffs have appealed from the trial court s order, and that appeal is pending.   
 From time to time, we have received requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We are also subject to various other legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.

        MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS   OF OPERATIONS      

 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   
 Overview  
 We design, develop, manufacture, and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, and energy products. We are currently producing and selling our Model S sedan and our Model X sport utility vehicle. We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with all-wheel drive capability, autopilot options, and free over-the-air software updates.  We commenced customer deliveries of Model X in September 2015 and continue to ramp production. We unveiled Model 3, a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market, in the first quarter of 2016 which received significant interest.  
 In addition to our automotive products, we continue to sell our energy products, the Powerwall for residential applications and the Powerpack for commercial, industrial and utility-scale applications.  We began production and deliveries of these products in the third quarter of 2015. We transitioned the production of these products from the Tesla Factory to the Gigafactory during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of our vehicles. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recognized total revenues of $2.30 billion, an increase of $1.36 billion over total revenues of $936.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, primarily driven by growth of vehicle deliveries worldwide, including increasing production and deliveries of Model X. Gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was 27.7%, an increase from 24.7% for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 
 We continue to increase our sales and service footprint worldwide and expand our Supercharging and destination charging networks. With the continued global expansion of our customer support infrastructure, selling, general and administrative expenses were $ 336.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $236.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 

Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks  
 Demand, Production and Deliveries  
 We are currently producing and selling both the Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle.  We have broadened the appeal of these vehicles by introducing new variants that improve range, performance, and value, as well as enhanced autopilot functionality, and we expect to introduce further new vehicle versions and functionality over time.  Overall, we expect that demand for our vehicles will continue to increase worldwide as more people drive and become aware of our vehicles, as we grow our customer sales, service and charging infrastructure, as we continue to offer less expensive vehicles such as Model 3, and as we continue to develop our vehicles. Additionally, we believe that demand for our energy products will continue to increase. 
 We continue to make progress in increasing vehicle production and plan to continue increasing total vehicle production to support approximately 50,000 deliveries in the second half of this year. In the third quarter of 2016, we produced approximately 25,180 vehicles, including approximately 10,450 Model X vehicles. Total third quarter production increased 37% from the second quarter.  Although our Model X production ramp has faced challenges, including supplier part shortages, we continue to make steady progress increasing Model X production. 
 In addition, we are on track to achieve volume production and deliveries of Model 3 in the second half of 2017.  We expect our production will increase considerably each year for the next several years, and are targeting an overall vehicle production level of 500,000 vehicles, including Model S, Model X and Model 3, in 2018.  Increasing production five-fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require additional capital, but this is our goal and we are working hard to achieve it.   
   In addition to expanding our vehicle production and deliveries, we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles over the next several quarters due to economies of scale, material cost reductions and more efficient manufacturing. We expect that this trend will contribute to improve total automotive gross margin over time, excluding the impact of foreign currency movements. Significant cost improvements for Model S have been achieved relating to material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions, and manufacturing efficiencies, excluding the impact of newly introduced Model S variants and Model X. However, during our product introductions over the last few years, we sometimes encountered manufacturing inefficiencies and supplier constraints which negatively impacted our gross margin. If we are not able to continue to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives or continue to ramp Model X efficiently, our ability to reach our gross margin goals would be negatively affected.  
 25 

We are expanding our sales,   service and charging infrastructure worldwide to accommodate a much larger fleet of vehicles and provide timely customer services in areas with a high concentration of Tesla customers.  In particular, we continue to open additional retail and service loca  tions and should have approximately 265 locations worldwide by the end of 2016.  Because we sell our vehicles in many countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia, and our retail and service expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in whic  h we already have a presence, we expect our long-term sales outside of North America will be over half of our worldwide total automotive revenue.     As compared to markets in the United States, we have less experience in international markets, and thus we may   face difficulties meeting our future international expansion plans with respect to timing and expected sales. If we experience unexpected difficulties or delays in finding or opening desirable locations for stores and service centers, we may not be able t  o meet our delivery plans and sales goals.   
 Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses 
 We have advanced our 500,000 total unit build plan by two years to 2018.  Given this plan, we continue to invest heavily in capital expenditures.  Our capital expenditure needs include expenditures for the tooling, production equipment and construction of the Model 3 production lines, equipment to support cell production at the Gigafactory, as well as new retail locations service centers and Supercharger locations. 
 We currently expect operating expenses to grow by approximately 30% in 2016 as compared to 2015, excluding any potential impact from the future SolarCity acquisition.  This increase is driven by engineering, design, and testing expenses related to Model 3 supplier contracts and higher sales and service costs associated with expanding our geographic presence. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but decline over time as a percentage of revenue as we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure. Over time, we also expect total operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue.   
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the net book value of our Supercharger network was $193.9 million and $166.6 million, and as of September 30, 2016 our Supercharger network included 715 locations globally. We plan to continue investing in our Supercharger network for the foreseeable future, including in North America, Europe and Asia, and expect such spending to continue to be a minimal portion of total capital spending during 2016. During 2016, we expect that this investment will grow our Supercharger network over 40%. We allocate Supercharger related expenses to cost of total automotive revenues and selling, general, and administrative expenses. These costs were immaterial for all periods presented. 
 Customer Financing Options 
 We offer loans and leases in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions. We offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and as of September 30, 2016 had approximately 24,400 vehicles under this program. We recently discontinued the resale value guarantee in North America, but continue to offer it in selected European and Asian markets. Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the next 12 months  total $204.1 million  in value and relate to approximately 4,390 vehicles. 
 Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods as they are considered leases for accounting purposes. 
 While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates, or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows. Alternatively, in cases where customers retain their vehicles past the expiration of the guarantee period, the remaining deferred revenues and costs will be recognized at no gross profit. 
 Based on current market demand for our cars, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts. Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted materially. 
 26 

We currently offer leases in the U.S. dire  ctly from our captive financing entity, as well as through a leasing partner. Leasing through Tesla Finance is now available in 39 states and the District of Columbia. We also offer financing arrangements through entities in Canada, Germany and the U.K.  A  s of September 30, 2016, we have active leases for approximately 9,070 vehicles through our captive financing entities and approximately 13,990 vehicles through our leasing partner. Leasing through both our captive financing entities and our leasing partne  r exposes us to residual value risk and will adversely impact our near-term operating results by requiring the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. In addition, for leases offered directly from our captive financing en  tities (but not for those offered through our bank partner), we only receive a limited portion of cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk.  We plan to continue expanding our financing offerings, including our lease finan  cing options and the financial sources to support them, and to support the overall financing needs of our customers. To the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive, our sales, financial results, and   cash flow could be negatively impacted.    
 The Gigafactory and Manufacturing 
 We are developing the Gigafactory as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material, cells, modules and battery packs in one location. We broke ground on the Gigafactory in June 2014 and began assembling our energy products in the first portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2015.  We currently expect to produce cells at the Gigafactory beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 for use initially in our energy products and later for our vehicles. Our revised vehicle build plan also includes an adjustment of our cell production plans at the Gigafactory.  We continue to invest in construction of the building and utilities at the Gigafactory and in production equipment for battery, module and pack production. We are responsible for the overall management of the Gigafactory and will engage with partners who have significant experience in battery cell and material production. Panasonic has agreed to partner with us on the Gigafactory with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at the Gigafactory at negotiated prices.  As these terms convey a right to use the production related assets as defined within ASC 840    Leases , we will consider these leased assets beginning with the start of cell production in 2016. This will result in us recording the value of such assets within property, plant, and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations. For all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at the Gigafactory, we will record the value of such assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Based on our current assessment, as of September 30, 2016, approximately $300 million is expected to be recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet by fourth quarter of 2016.  
 Although we continue to remain on track with our progress at the Gigafactory, given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating the Gigafactory exceeding our current expectations and the Gigafactory taking longer to bring online than we currently anticipate. In addition, we continue to expand production capacity at our Fremont facility and are exploring additional production capacity in Asia and Europe.    
   
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.    
 For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to the  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  section of our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, please refer to Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which also includes discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements that may impact us.

Results of Operations   
 Revenues  

Automotive revenue includes revenues related to sale of new Model S and Model X vehicles, including internet connectivity, Supercharger access, and specified software updates for cars equipped with Autopilot hardware, as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers.  Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for cars sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating lease under lease accounting, and Model S and Model X leasing revenue.  
 Services and other revenue consists of sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, maintenance and development services, energy products, and pre-owned vehicles.  
 Automotive revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 149%, to $1.9 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to a 132% increase in vehicle deliveries from approximately 7,220 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately 16,790 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The increase in vehicle deliveries is primarily due to the introduction of Model X as well as increased production and sale of Model S.  In addition, there was an increase in average selling price of 5.3% primarily due to the introduction of Model X which are higher priced vehicles compared to Model S, partially offset by an increase in sales of lower priced 60 kWh vehicles.  Revenue recognized from the sale of regulatory credits increased by $114.7 million from three months ended September 30, 2015 to the corresponding period in 2016. 
 Automotive revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 59%, to $3.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily related to a 52% increase in vehicle deliveries from approximately 22,450 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately 34,140 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The increase in volume is primarily due to the introduction of Model X.  Further, there was an increase in average selling price of 5.1% primarily due to the introduction of Model X which are higher priced vehicles compared to Model S. Revenue recognized from the sale of regulatory credits increased by $113.9 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the corresponding period in 2016.  
 Automotive leasing revenue increased $147.7 million, or 177%, to $231.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased $300.4 million, or 145%, to $507.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase during both periods was primarily due to a 119% increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with a resale value guarantee from approximately 22,000 on a cumulative basis through September 30, 2015, to approximately 48,000 on a cumulative basis through September 30, 2016.  In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $55.0 million in automotive leasing revenue upon the expiration of resale value guarantees.   
 Service and other revenue increased $65.5 million, or 78%, to $149.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $21.9 million in energy product sales, an increase of $21.2 million in pre-owned vehicle sales, an increase in maintenance service revenue of $13.6 million, and an increase of $10.0 million in sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers.  Service and other revenue increased $151.2 million, or 73%, to $358.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was related primarily to an increase of $59.7 million in pre-owned vehicle sales, an increase of $53.3 million in maintenance service revenue, and an increase of $47.0 million in energy product sales.  
 28 

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit   

Cost of automotive revenues includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including amortized tooling costs, royalty fees, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.  Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred.  Cost of services and other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and energy products, costs associated with providing maintenance and development    services , and cost to acquire and certify pre-owned vehicle.   
 Cost of automotive revenues increased $772.6 million, or 133%, to $1.4 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to a 132% increase in vehicle deliveries from 7,220 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately 16,790 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of the introduction of Model X and increased Model S deliveries. Cost of automotive revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 60%, to $2.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily related to a 52% increase in vehicle deliveries from approximately 22,450 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately 34,140 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the introduction of Model X. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in warranty estimate related to improved reliability of our vehicles.   
 Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $115.8 million, or 251%, to $162.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased $191.9 million, or 162%, to $310.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase is primarily due to a 119% increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantee from approximately 22,000 on a cumulative basis through September 30, 2015, to approximately 48,000 on a cumulative basis through September 30, 2016 under our leasing program and programs with a resale value guarantee.  In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $55.0 million in cost of automotive leasing revenues upon the expiration of resale value guarantees. 
 Cost of services and other revenue increased $68.1 million, or 89%, to $144.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $20.1 million in cost of pre-owned vehicle sales, an increase of $23.3 million of energy related product cost of sale, and an increase of $18.8 million in cost to provide maintenance service.  Cost of services and other revenue increased $146.0 million, or 73%, to $345.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in cost of services and other was driven primarily by an increase of $58.5 million in cost of pre-owned vehicle sales, an increase of $48.4 million in cost of energy product sales, and an increase of $42.4 million in cost to provide maintenance services.   
 Gross margin  
 Gross margin increased 3.0 percentage points to 27.7% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in regulatory credits sold to other automotive manufacturers, an increase in manufacturing efficiencies, and an updated warranty estimate due to improved reliability of our vehicles.  
 Gross margin decreased 0.2 percentage points to 24.7% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the introduction of Model X which had a lower margin as we ramped up production, partially offset by an increase in regulatory credits sales and an updated warranty estimate due to improved reliability of our vehicles. 
 29 

Research and Development Expenses   

Research and development (R D) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, supply chain, quality, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense.  
 R D expenses increased $35.5 million, or 20%, to $214.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.   The increase in R D expenses consisted primarily of a $17.5 million increase in outside services for engineering, design and tooling for Model 3, a $16.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to an 11% increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants, a $14.8 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to headcount increase as we expand our business in the U.S. and internationally, partially offset by a $23.2 million decrease in expensed materials related to our Model X development, which was primarily incurred in 2015.   
 R D expenses increased $60.8 million, or 12%, to $588.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in R D expenses consisted primarily of a $49.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to increased headcount and number of awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants, a $52.3 million increase in employee and labor related expenses, a $13.1 million increase in outside services, partially offset by a $51.5 million decrease in expensed materials related to our Model X development, which was primarily incurred in 2015.  
 Selling, General and Administrative 

Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our Tesla stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as litigation settlements and fees for professional and contract services.  
 SG A expenses increased $100.4 million, or 42%, to $366.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in our SG A expenses represents additional investment made by us to support the growing sales activities worldwide and the expansion of our business, including increased headcount to support an expanded retail, service and Supercharger footprint as well as the general growth of the business.  The increase in our SG A expenses consisted primarily of a $56.4 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to a 57% increase in headcount as we expand our business in the U.S. and internationally, a $29.1 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related costs to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence, and a $12.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to increased number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and existing employees.  
 SG A expenses increased $342.6 million, or 54%, to $976.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   The increase in our SG A expenses represents additional investment made by us to support the growing sales activities worldwide and the expansion of our business, including increased headcount to support an expanded retail, service and Supercharger footprint as well as the general growth of the business.   Specifically, the increase consisted primarily of a $199.0 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to a 57% increase in our headcount, a $95.6 million increase in office, information technology and facilities-related, and a $46.1 million increase in stock-based compensation related to increased number of awards granted for new hire and existing employees.

Interest Expense   

Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $46.7 million and $133.7 million, as compared to $29.3 million and $80.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing increases of 59% and 67%, respectively. These  increases as compared to the same periods in 2015 was due to an increase in interest expense on vehicles sales that we account for as collateralized borrowing, increased interest expense on build-to-suit leases, and on higher balances of outstanding debt. 
 Other Expense, Net  

Other expense, net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates.  
 Other expense was $11.8 million and $10.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $15.4 million and $24.5 million during the same period in 2015, representing decreases of 24% and 59%, respectively.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a $7 million loss recognized on the conversion of our 2018 Notes.  The remainder of the change in other expense, net, was primarily result of fluctuations in gains (losses) from foreign currency exchange. 
 Provision for Income Taxes  

Our provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $8.1 million and $15.6 million, compared to $1.8 million and $8.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing increases of 356% and 96%, respectively. The increases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to an increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $3.1 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents, which included $2.4 billion of money market funds.  This balance included $200 million drawn under our asset based line of credit and an additional $300 million drawn under our Warehouse Agreement which we entered into in August 2016 to support the Tesla Finance direct leasing program.  Amounts held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $634.1 million as of September 30, 2016, and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, Hong Kong dollars, euros and Japanese yen.  
 31 

Sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles, as well as customer   deposits for vehicles, sales of regulatory credits, proceeds from retail financing activities, sales of energy products, and non-warranty repair and maintenance services. In the short term, we expect that our current sources of liquidity, including cash an  d cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating and retail financing activities, will provide us with adequate liquidity based on our current plans. We may raise funds in the future, including through potential equity   or debt offerings, subject to market conditions and recognizing that we cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. The amount and timing of funds that we may raise is undetermined and would vary based on   a number of factors, including our liquidity needs as well as access to current and future sources of liquidity.  
 These current sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund our ongoing operations and research and development projects, the initial investments in tooling and manufacturing capital for our planned Model 3; the continued construction of our Gigafactory; and the expansion of our retail stores, service centers and Supercharger network.  We advanced our 500,000 total unit build plan by two years to 2018, which is approximately double our prior growth plan.  Given this plan, we are currently in the process of evaluating our capital expenditure needs, but expect it will be approximately $1.8 billion for the full year of 2016.   
 As of September 30, 2016, we have two credit facilities available: (1) senior secured asset-based revolving Credit Agreement ( Credit Agreement ) up to the lesser of $1.0 billion or the value of the secured assets as determined monthly pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and (2) a Loan and Security Agreement ( Warehouse Agreement ) of borrowing up to $300 million to support our vehicle leasing program.  As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding amounts under the credit facilities are $200 million and $300 million under the Credit Agreement and the Warehouse Agreement, respectively.   
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid $421.8 million and $435.5 million for certain conversions of our 2018 Notes, reducing the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2018 Notes to $224.3 million .    
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we increased our funding limit by over 80% with a banking partner for vehicle leasing, where we receive cash for the full price of the vehicles upon delivery.  We plan to add a new vehicle leasing partner in the fourth quarter of 2016.   
 In addition, on July 31, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding common stock of SolarCity Corporation in exchange for Tesla common stock.  If the acquisition is completed, the operation of the combined company could require additional capital depending on future conditions.   
 Summary of Cash Flows (in thousands) 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  
 Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as manufacturing, research and development and selling, general and administrative. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory, personnel related expenditures, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities.  
 Our operating cash inflows include cash from sales of our vehicles, customer deposits for vehicles, including Model 3, sales of regulatory credits, sales of powertrain components and systems, and energy products. These cash inflows are offset by payments we make to our suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process, employee compensation, operating leases and interest expense on our financings.  
 32 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $324.4 million and was primarily a result of net loss incurred of $553.6 mil  lion, increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $697.5 million as our business expands, an increase in customer deposits of $409.1 million primarily as a result of Model 3 reservations, an increase in resale value guarantee of $322.2 million   and deferred revenue of $256.2 million as the number of vehicle deliveries with resale value guarantee increased.  These increases were partially offset by an increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of $1.8 billion as we expand our program for   direct lease and vehicles with resale value guarantee.  Cash provided by operating activities also included non-cash adjustments of $1.0 billion.       
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in operating activities was $494.7 million and was primarily a result of net loss incurred of $568.3 million, and an increase of inventories and operating lease vehicles of $1.1 billion as we expanded our program for direct lease and vehicles with resale value guarantee.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in resale value guarantee of $249.5 million and deferred revenue of $186.3 million as the number vehicles with resale value guarantee increased.  Cash used by operating activities also included non-cash adjustments of $551.3 million. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities  
 Cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations, including investments in manufacturing equipment and tooling, the continued construction of our Gigafactory, and our stores, service centers and Supercharger network infrastructure.  Cash used in investing activities was $821.7 million and $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Cash flows from investing activities and variability between each year related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $759.2 million and $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
 In 2014, we began construction of our Gigafactory facility in Nevada.  Tesla s contribution to total capital expenditures are expected to be about $2.0 billion. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we used cash of $222.1 million towards Gigafactory construction and expect to spend a total of approximately $550.0 million during 2016. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $2.4 billion and $1.3 billion. Cash flows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of $1.7 billion net proceeds from our May 2016 public offering of 7,915,004 shares of common stock, proceeds from issuance of debt of $1.7 billion which consisted of $1.3 billion of borrowing under our Credit Agreement, $300 million borrowing Warehouse Agreement, and proceeds received from vehicle sales to our bank leasing partners of $557.7 million. These increases were partially offset by repayment of borrowing under our Credit Agreement of $1.1 billion and  settlement of $435.5 million for certain conversions of our 2018 Notes .  Cash flows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted primarily of $738.3 million net proceeds from August 2015 public offering of 3,099,173 shares of common stock and $360.0 million received from vehicle sales to our bank leasing partners.   
 0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions  
 In 2014, we issued $920.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.38 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from 2019 Notes and $1.36 billion from 2021 Notes. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum for the 2019 and 2021 Notes and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014.  
 In connection with the offering of these notes in 2014, we purchased convertible note hedges for an aggregate $603.4 million and sold warrants for an aggregate $389.2 million. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments upon the conversion of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes.  
 During the third quarter of 2016, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of September 30, 2016. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible during the third quarter of 2016 and are classified as long-term debt. Should the closing price conditions be met in the third quarter of 2016 or a future quarter, the 2019 Notes and/or the 2021 Notes will be convertible at their holders  option during the immediately following quarter.  
 33 

1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions   
 In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. The interest under the 2018 Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013.  
 In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for an aggregate $177.5 million and sold warrants for an aggregate $120.3 million. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments upon the conversion of the 2018 Notes.  
 During the third quarter of 2016, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the third quarter of 2016. As such, we classified the $213.0 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes as current liabilities and classified $11.3 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2018 Notes of $224.3 million and the carrying value of 2018 Notes, as mezzanine equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016. Should the closing price conditions be met again in a future quarter, the 2018 Notes will be convertible at their holders  option during the immediately following quarter.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid a total of $435.5 million related to conversions of the 2018 Notes .  
 For more information on the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   
 Contractual Obligations    
 We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, including certain debt financing arrangements and leases, primarily for stores, service centers, certain manufacturing and corporate offices. These also include, as part of our normal business practices, contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation contracts.  

(1)    
 
 Amounts do not include future cash payments for purchase obligations which were recorded in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities at September 30, 2016.    

(2)    
 
 These totals represent a quantification of aggregate amounts pursuant to purchase orders issued under binding and enforceable agreements with all vendors as of September 30, 2016, as well as any other estimable and calculable purchase obligations pursuant to such agreements, including any additional amounts we may have to pay vendors if we do not meet certain minimum purchase obligations. Where the timing of payments are not known or estimable, we have included the amount only in the total column.    

 34 

(3)      
 
        In 2014, Panasonic agreed to partner with us on the Gigafactory with investments in production equipment that it will use to   manufacture and supply us with battery cells. The parties had agreed to one such investment to be made by Panasonic, with additional investments to be made from time to time if and as agreed to by the parties. As of September 30, 2016, the quantities, cos  t and timing of potential purchases we may make under this arrangement were subject to a number of factors, such as future vehicle demand, that could not be determined with certainty. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, any obligation to make payments   to Panasonic pursuant to this arrangement was subject to the achievement of certain technological and engineering milestones and other contingent events. Based solely on certain preliminary assumptions made at the time the arrangement was entered into in 2  014 for purposes of reference and further ongoing discussion as of September 30, 2016, the potential battery cell purchases that we may have to make from Panasonic pursuant to and during the term of the one investment agreement existing at September 30, 20  16 would equal approximately $1.7 billion in the aggregate. Additionally, as the timing of our purchases were unknown as of September 30, 2016, we have included the amount only in the total column.     

(4)      
 
  During the third quarter of 2016, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the fourth quarter of 2016. As such, we classified the $224.3 million principal balance of our 2018 Notes as current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and have included related contractual payments in the three months ended December 31, 2016 category in the table above.     

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     

 Foreign Currency Risk  
 We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries and against the U.S. dollar. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, revenues and expenses may be significantly impacted and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany balances. As of September 30, 2016, our largest currency exposures are from the euro, Chinese yuan, Hong Kong dollars, and Japanese yen. We recorded foreign exchange loss of $3.9 million in other income (expense), net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.  
 We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies as of September 30, 2016 to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $259.0 million, recorded to other income (expense), net, principally from intercompany and cash balances.  
 In November 2015, we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in Japanese yen. The derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 months or less. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. We document each hedge relationship and assess its initial effectiveness at the inception of the hedge contract and we measure its ongoing effectiveness on a quarterly basis using regression analysis. During the term of an effective hedge contract, we record gains and losses within accumulated other comprehensive loss. We reclassify these gains or losses to costs of automotive sales in the period the related finished goods inventory is sold or over the depreciation period for those sales accounted for as leases. Although our contracts are considered effective hedges, we may experience small amounts of ineffectiveness due to timing differences between our actual inventory purchases and the settlement date of the related foreign currency forward contracts. Ineffectiveness related to the hedges is immaterial as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016 we had recorded a cumulative gain of $19.2 million to AOCI related to our outstanding foreign currency cash flow hedges. If the U.S. dollar had strengthened by 10% as of September 30, 2016, the gain recorded in AOCI related to our cumulative foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been reduced by approximately $10.4 million. 
   
 35 

Interest Rate Risk   
 We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2016. A significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents.  
 As  of September 30, 2016, we had $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding, which are fixed rate instruments. Therefore, our results of operations are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates. However, the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2016.

   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES     

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

P    ART II. OTHER   INFORMATION   

I  TEM 1.   
 
       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS     

 Securities Litigation  
 In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint made claims against Tesla and our CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney s fees on the basis of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr. Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions, including with respect to the safety of Model S. This case was brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. On September 26, 2014, the trial court, upon the motion of Tesla and Mr. Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and thereafter issued a formal written order to that effect. The plaintiffs have appealed from the trial court s order, and that appeal is pending. 
 Litigation Relating to the Pending SolarCity Acquisition  
 Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging Tesla s proposed acquisition of SolarCity (the  SolarCity Acquisition ). These lawsuits are captioned as  City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund  v.  Elon Musk, et al. , C.A, No. 12711-VCS;  Ellen Prasinos  v.  Elon Musk, et al. , C.A. No. 12723-VCS;  Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, et al.  v.  Elon Musk, et al. , C.A. No. 12740-VCS;  P. Evan Stephens  v.  Elon Musk, et al ., C.A. No. 1275-VCS;  Pyare Diwana  v.  Elon Musk, et. al ., C.A. No. 12796-VCS;  Nguyen  v.  Elon Musk, et. al ., C.A. No. 12804-VCS; and  Wolf  v.  Elon Musk, et. al ., C.A. No. 12805-VCS (collectively, the  Actions ). Each of the Actions names as defendants the members of Tesla s board of directors, and certain of the Actions also name as defendants D Subsidiary, Inc., Tesla s wholly-owned subsidiary which would merge with and into SolarCity, SolarCity, certain members of SolarCity s board of Directors, Evercore Group L.L.C., Tesla s financial advisor in connection with the SolarCity Acquisition, and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. The Actions seek to assert claims derivatively on behalf of Tesla, alleging, among other things, that the members of Tesla s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the SolarCity Acquisition and, in some cases, that SolarCity and members of SolarCity s board of directors, Evercore, and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties and that certain individual defendants would be unjustly enriched by the SolarCity Acquisition. Certain of the Actions also assert putative class action claims against the members of Tesla s board of directors, including on the ground that the preliminary joint proxy statement/prospectus filed on August 31, 2016, including as amended, allegedly failed to disclose material facts in connection with the SolarCity Acquisition. The Actions seek, among other relief, damages in an unspecified amount, rescission of the SolarCity Acquisition, and attorneys  fees and costs. Certain of the plaintiffs have filed motions for a preliminary injunction to prevent Tesla from consummating the SolarCity Acquisition or any vote thereon and motions for expedited proceedings. On September 23, 2016, the Court set a schedule for consolidation of the Actions and determination of a plaintiffs  leadership structure, and the Court scheduled a hearing for October 14, 2016, to consider any motion for expedited proceedings. On October 10, the Court entered orders consolidating the Actions and appointing lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. On October 11, 2016, lead counsel informed the Court that they do not intend to move for expedited proceedings, and the Court canceled the previously scheduled hearing to consider any such motion. Tesla believes that the Actions are without merit. 
 Other Matters  
 From time to time, we have received requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We are also subject to various other legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.

ITEM 1A.   
 
        RI  SK FACTORS      

 You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company.  In addition, you should read and consider the risks associated with the proposed SolarCity Acquisition, which can be found in our Registration Statement on Form S-4 (No. 333-213390) in the section entitled  Risk Factors,  which section, other than the introductory paragraph and the paragraphs entitled  Risks Related to the Business of the Combined Company Following the Merger  Tesla s stock price may be negatively impacted by risks and conditions that apply to Tesla, which are different from the risks and conditions applicable to SolarCity  and  Other Risk Factors of Tesla and SolarCity,  is incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. Such risk factors form a part of this Quarterly Report. Moreover,  risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry    
 We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, significant delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch and production ramp of new vehicles and other products such as our energy products, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 
 We have experienced delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models in the past, such as production ramp delays for Model S in 2012 and the All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S, and the launch and ramp of Model X. For example, while we commenced Model X deliveries late in the third quarter of 2015, at times we encountered unanticipated challenges, such as certain supply chain constraints, in ramping production of Model X vehicles that forced us to decrease the production of these vehicles from our initial expectations. If unexpected issues arise or recur with respect to any of our production vehicles, we may experience further delays. In addition, since our vehicle models share certain production facilities with the other models, the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact the production of other models. 
 We may also experience similar delays or other complications in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicles, such as Model 3, and other products such as our energy products. Any significant additional delay or other complication in the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, including complications associated with expanding our production capacity, supply chain or regulatory approvals, could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.  
 We may experience delays in realizing our projected timelines and cost and volume targets for the production, launch and ramp of our Model 3 vehicle, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.  
 Our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to develop, manufacture, market and sell the Model 3 vehicle, which we intend to offer at a lower price point and to produce at significantly higher volumes than our present production capabilities for the Model S or Model X vehicles. We unveiled a prototype of Model 3 in March 2016 and have announced our goal to achieve volume production and deliveries of this vehicle in late 2017. 
 We have no experience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we anticipate for Model 3, and to be successful, we will need to  develop efficient, automated, low-cost manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains necessary to support such volumes.  Additionally, various aspects of the Model 3 component procurement and manufacturing plans are still being determined. While critical long lead time equipment and components have been sourced, we are currently evaluating, qualifying and selecting some of our suppliers for the planned production of Model 3. We will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that Model 3 is in compliance with our quality standards and applicable regulations prior to beginning mass production and delivery of the vehicles. Moreover, our Model 3 production plan will also require significant investments of cash and management resources.  
 Our production plan for Model 3 is based on many key assumptions, including: 

that we will be able to develop, build and equip a new dedicated final assembly line for high volume production of Model 3 at the Tesla Factory without exceeding our projected costs and on our projected timeline;     

that we will be able to continue to build and bring online the Gigafactory in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells and integrate such cells into finished battery packs for Model 3, all at costs that allow us to sell Model 3 at our target gross margins;     

that the equipment and processes which we select and install for Model 3 production will be able to accurately manufacture high volumes of Model 3 vehicles within specified design tolerances and with high quality;     

 38 

that we will be able to continue to engage suppliers for the necessary components o  n terms and conditions that are acceptable to us and that we will be able to obtain components on a timely basis and in the necessary quantities to support high volume production;     

that we will be able to complete our final tooling, production planning and validation for Model 3 and the delivery of final component designs to our suppliers in a timely manner; and     

that we will be able to attract, recruit, hire and train skilled employees, including employees on the production line, to operate our planned high volume Model 3 production facilities at the Tesla Factory and the Gigafactory.     

 If one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect, our ability to successfully launch Model 3 on time and at volumes and prices that are profitable, as well as our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition, may be materially and adversely impacted. 
 We may be unable to meet our growing vehicle production and delivery plans, both of which could harm our business and prospects. 
 Our plans call for significant increases in vehicle production and deliveries to high volumes in a short amount of time. Our ability to achieve these plans will depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to add production lines and capacity as planned while maintaining our desired quality levels and optimize design and production changes, and our suppliers  ability to support our needs. Due to the complexity of our supply chain, if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our production plans, or change components or suppliers, we may have to incur unexpected costs to maintain, store and pay for components in excess of our needs or capabilities. We have limited experience developing, manufacturing, selling and servicing, and allocating our available resources among, multiple products simultaneously. If we are unable to realize our plans, or experience any delays or disruption in our production of our vehicles, our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially damaged.  
 In addition, we have used and may use in the future a number of new manufacturing technologies, techniques and processes for our vehicles, which we must successfully introduce and scale for high volume production. For example, we have introduced aluminum spot welding systems and high-speed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle parts. Our vehicles also have unique design features, such as a 17 inch display screen, dual motor drivetrain and autopilot hardware introduced in Model S and falcon-wing doors and other unique features introduced in Model X, each of which poses different manufacturing challenges. 
 Concurrent with the significant planned increase in our vehicle production levels, we will also need to continue to significantly increase deliveries of our vehicles. We have limited experience in delivering a high volume of vehicles, and no experience in delivering vehicles at the significantly higher volumes we anticipate for Model 3, and we may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans into both existing markets as well as new markets into which we expand. If we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goals globally, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 
 Our long-term success will be dependent upon our ability to achieve market acceptance of our vehicles, including Model S and Model X, and new vehicle models such as Model 3. 
 There is no guarantee that Model S, Model X or our future vehicles such as Model 3 will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public, especially in the long-term. Although we have successfully grown demand for Model S to date and have seen strong initial demand for Model X and Model 3, and we believe that we will be able to continue to grow demand for these vehicles, there is no guarantee that future demand for Model S or Model X, or new vehicle models such as Model 3, of which we have unveiled only a prototype to date, will meet consumer expectations. To the extent that our vehicles do not meet such expectations, our future sales could be harmed. 
 While we believe that there will continue to be separate and strong demand for each of our vehicles, we have limited experience in selling multiple vehicle models at the same time. Although we believe that each of our vehicles and their variants meet a distinct segment of the automotive market, if our vehicles in fact compete with one another in the market, then our ability to sell each vehicle model at planned quantities or prices may be impacted. 
 39 

Future problems or delays in bringing the Gigafactory online and operating it in line with our expectations could negatively affect the production and profitability of our products, such as   Model 3 or energy products.  
 To lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume, we intend to integrate the production of lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs for our vehicles, including Model 3, and energy products at our new Gigafactory. We have no direct experience in the production of lithium-ion cells. Although we continue to remain on track with our progress at the Gigafactory, given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating the Gigafactory exceeding our current expectations and the Gigafactory taking longer to bring online than we currently anticipate. Also, our recently revised vehicle build plan includes an adjustment of our plans at the Gigafactory. In order to build our Model 3 vehicles at our planned volume and target gross margin, we must have significant battery cell production from our Gigafactory. If we are unable to complete building the Gigafactory in a timely manner, and attract, hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel to work there in order to produce high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells at reasonable prices, our ability to supply battery packs to our vehicles, especially Model 3, and other products according to our schedule and/or at a price that allows us to sell them at our target gross margins and in the quantities we estimate could be negatively impacted. Any such future problems or delays with the Gigafactory could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 
 If our vehicles or other products that contain our vehicle powertrains or battery packs fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed. 
 If our vehicles, vehicles that contain our powertrains or our energy products were to contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, our ability to develop, market and sell our products could be harmed. For example, the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex and could conceivably contain defects and errors. Issues experienced by customers have included those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery in the Model S and the seats and doors in the Model X. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our vehicles as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not be up to the satisfaction of our customers. While we have performed extensive internal testing, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics of our battery packs, powertrains, vehicles and energy products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to consumers.  
 Any product defects or any other failure of our products to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our Model X vehicles have not yet been evaluated by NHTSA for a star rating under the New Car Assessment Program, and while based on our internal testing we expect to obtain comparable ratings to those achieved by Model S, there is no assurance this will occur.  
 We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver, or their refusal to deliver, necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels, and volumes acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.    
 Our current products contain numerous purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers, the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers despite efforts to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever feasible. Furthermore, we do not maintain long-term agreements with a number of our suppliers. This limited supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the production of our products. We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delays due to supply chain disruptions with respect to our current products and future products we may produce, such as those we have experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our slower-than-planned Model S and Model X ramps.  
 Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, labor issues, wars, governmental changes, natural disasters such as the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan and other factors beyond our and our suppliers  control, could also affect our suppliers  ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Moreover, any significant unanticipated demand may require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time, and in the past  we have also replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards.  While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources of supply for most of our components in a relatively short time frame, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles.  The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to vehicle design changes and delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative publicity, damage to our brand and a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.  
 40 

Changes in our supply chain have also resulted in th  e past, and may result in the future, in increased cost. We have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made, and we may experien  ce similar cost increases in the future. Certain suppliers, including for Model X, have experienced delays in meeting our demand or quality requirements, or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements. Additionally, we are negotiating w  ith existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier co  sts, our operating results will suffer.   
 Moreover, we have signed an agreement with Panasonic to be our partner in the Gigafactory and be responsible for, among other things, manufacturing cells from there for use in our products. If we encounter unexpected difficulties with our current suppliers, including Panasonic, and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers, we could experience production delays and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing, servicing and supporting our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 
 We expect the foregoing discussion to apply generally to Model 3. However, because we plan to produce Model 3 at significantly higher volumes than Model S or Model X, the negative impact of any delays or other constraints with respect to our suppliers for Model 3 could be substantially greater than any such issues experienced with respect to Model S, Model X or our energy products. As some of our current suppliers may not have the resources, equipment or scalability to provide components for the Model 3 in line with our requirements, we may need to engage a significant number of new suppliers with whom we have relatively little or no experience, and such suppliers may have to ramp to achieve our needs in a short period of time. There is no assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able to meet our cost, quality and volume needs. 
 Our future growth is dependent upon consumers  willingness to adopt electric vehicles, especially in the mass market demographic which we are targeting with Model 3. 
 Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular, especially in the mass market demographic which we are targeting with Model 3.  
 If the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, and could be affected by numerous external factors, such as:  

p  erceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;      

perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;      

competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles;      

volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;      

government regulations and economic incentives; and     

access to charging facilities.     

 If we fail to scale our business operations and otherwise manage future growth effectively as we rapidly grow our company, especially internationally, we may not be able to produce, market, sell and service our products successfully. 
 Any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We continue to expand our operations significantly, especially internationally, including by a planned transition to high volume vehicle production and the worldwide sales and servicing of a significantly higher number of vehicles than our current vehicle fleet in the coming years, with the launch and ramp of Model 3. Furthermore, we are developing and growing our energy product business worldwide, including in countries where we have limited or no previous operating experience in connection with our vehicle business. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage our expansion and growth successfully. We may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to control expenses and avoid cost overruns and other unexpected operating costs; establish sufficient worldwide sales, service and Supercharger facilities in a timely manner; adapt our products to meet local requirements; implement the required infrastructure, systems and processes; and find and hire a significant number of additional manufacturing, engineering, service and administrative personnel.  
 41 

If we are unable to continue to reduce the manufacturing costs of Model S and Model X or control manufacturing costs   for Model 3, our financial condition and operating results will suffer.   
 As we have gradually ramped production of Model S and Model X, manufacturing costs per vehicle have decreased.  While we expect ongoing cost reductions to be realized by both us and our suppliers, there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals. We incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our vehicles, assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel. We may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in increasing the production capability of our vehicle manufacturing facilities, such as for Model 3. Furthermore, if we are unable to achieve production cost targets on our Model X and Model 3 vehicles pursuant to our plans, we may not be able to meet our gross margin and other financial targets. 
 Furthermore, many of the factors that impact our manufacturing costs are beyond our control, such as potential increases in the costs of our raw materials and components, such as lithium-ion battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels. If we are unable to continue to control and reduce our manufacturing costs, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed.  
   
 Although we are significantly dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of the Model S and Model X in the near term, our future success will be dependent upon our ability to design and achieve market acceptance of Model 3 and future vehicles with broad public appeal.  
 We currently generate a significant percentage of our revenues from the sale of our Model S and Model X vehicles. The Model 3, for which we are planning to achieve volume production and deliveries in late 2017, requires significant investment prior to commercial introduction, and there is no guarantee that it will be commercially successful. The market for vehicles in the price range we expect for Model 3 is larger, but more competitive, than the markets for Model S and Model X. There can be no assurance that Model 3 or our future electric vehicles will meet the expectations of our customers or of a broad customer base. To the extent that we are not able to build the production Model 3 to the expectations created by the prototype we unveiled in March 2016, including the announced vehicle specifications and cost to customers, customers may cancel their reservations, our future sales could be harmed and investors may lose confidence in us. Furthermore, historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. To the extent our product cycles do not meet consumer expectations, our future sales may be adversely affected. 
 Reservations for Model 3 may be cancelled prior to their sale and are fully refundable to customers, and significant cancellations could harm our financial condition, business, prospects and operating results.  
 We have received a significant number of reservations for Model 3, all of which are subject to customer cancellations up until such time that the customer enters into a purchase agreement. As Model 3 will have a significantly lower price point than our previous vehicles and we do not expect to achieve volume production and deliveries of Model 3 before late 2017, we will for a lengthy period of time be subject to a number of factors that may result in cancellations of these reservations, including potential changes in customer financial position and preferences, competitive developments, and any unanticipated deviations from the expected price point, vehicle features or performance characteristics. There can be no assurance that any reservation will ultimately result in the sale of a vehicle, or that our number of reservations at any given time will accurately reflect the future demand for and sales of the Model 3. Furthermore, all amounts received by us in connection with reservations taken prior to the ramp of our vehicles have historically been refundable. Given the substantial number of Model 3 reservations, significant cancellations could harm our financial condition, business, prospects and operating results. 
 We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price to decline.  
 We occasionally provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding sales and production, as well as anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows. Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes and average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs, and planned cost reductions. If our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.  
 42 

Our vehicles make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame, and such events have raised concerns, and future events may lead to additional concerns, about the batteries us  ed in automotive applications.   
 The battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells.  
 While we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could subject us to lawsuits, product recalls, or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve our vehicles, could seriously harm our business. 
 In addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at the Tesla Factory and plan to produce high volumes of cells and battery modules and packs at our Gigafactory. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor s electric vehicle or energy product may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products. Such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.  
 We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial results. 
 Our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched. As we have increased Model S deliveries in markets outside of the United States, we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro, Chinese renminbi, Norwegian kroner, British pound and Canadian dollar. Any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically experienced. In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer. Moreover, while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure, it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact. As a result, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Our resale value guarantee and leasing programs for our vehicles expose us to the risk that the resale values of vehicles returned to us are lower than our estimates and may result in lower revenues, gross margin, profitability and liquidity.  
 We have provided resale value guarantees to many of our customers, under which such customers may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined resale values. Customers can lease our vehicles through both leasing partners and from us directly, through our captive finance companies. The resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs may be lower than our estimates, which are based on a limited secondary market for our vehicles. If the volume of vehicles returned to us is higher than our estimates and/or we are not able to resell them timely or at all, our liquidity could be negatively impacted. In cases where customers retain their vehicles past the guarantee period, our gross margin will be negatively impacted as all remaining revenues and costs related to the vehicle will be recognized at no gross profit.  
 We apply lease accounting on sales of vehicles with a resale value guarantee and on leases made directly by us or by our leasing partners. Under lease accounting, we recognize the associated revenues and costs of the vehicle sale over time rather than fully upfront at vehicle delivery. As a result, these programs generate lower revenues in the period the car is delivered and higher gross margins during the period of the resale value guarantee as compared to purchases in which the resale value guarantee does not apply. A higher than anticipated prevalence of these programs could therefore have an adverse impact on our near term revenues and operating results. Moreover, unlike the sale of a vehicle with a resale value guarantee or programs with leasing partners which do not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery, under a lease held directly by us, we may receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. To the extent we expand our leasing program without securing external financing or business partners to support such expansion, our cash flow and liquidity could also be negatively impacted. 
 43 

If we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual, financing and credit risks related to our direct vehicle leasing programs, our business may suffer.   
 We offer vehicle financing arrangements through our local subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Germany and the UK, including leasing directly through certain of those subsidiaries. The profitability of the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual values, secure adequate financing and/or business partners to fund and grow this program, and manage customer credit risk. If actual residual values of our vehicles are below our estimates, we may suffer lower profitability or potentially have losses. If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal funds, or partners or other external financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers, we may be unable to grow our sales. For example, in certain cases purchasing lease contracts from us is at the discretion of our partners and there is no guarantee that our partners will accept such contracts at the volumes and times requested by us. Additionally, if we do not properly screen customers for their creditworthiness, we may be exposed to excessive credit risks and associated losses. Furthermore, if our leasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth. Finally, if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties, either of which may harm our business. 
 Increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials, in particular for lithium-ion cells, could harm our business. 
 We may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials. Any such increase, supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, nickel and copper. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithium-ion cells. These risks include: 

the inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the numbers of lithium-ion cells we require;     

disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by battery cell manufacturers;     

an increase in the cost of raw materials used in the cells; and     

fluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as our battery cell purchases for Model S and Model X are currently denominated in Japanese yen.      

 Our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy products. While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs, we have fully qualified only a very limited number of suppliers for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers. In particular, we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in battery packs for our production vehicles. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendors could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or prices charged to us, such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased raw material costs could result in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand, image, business, prospects and operating results. 
 We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims. 
 Product liability claims could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected resulting in personal injury or death. We also may face similar claims related to any misuse or failures of new technologies that we are pioneering, including autopilot in our vehicles and our energy products. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles and energy products delivered to date and limited field experience of our products. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. In most jurisdictions, we self-insure against the risk of product liability claims, meaning that any product liability claims will have to be paid from company funds, not by insurance. 
 44 

The automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry. We currently face competition from new and established U.S. and international competitors and expect to face com  petition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.   
 The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. There is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete. Many established and new automobile manufacturers such as BMW, Daimler, General Motors and Toyota, as well as other large companies, have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do and almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, upon the launch of our Model 3 vehicle, we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entry-level premium sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes.  
 Demand in the automobile industry is volatile, which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and adversely affect our operating results.  
 Volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods. As a current low volume vehicle producer, we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully transition to a high volume producer with the production of the Model 3. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers. 
 If we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among consumers, analysts and within our industry, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and stock price may suffer materially. 
 Consumers may be less likely to purchase our products now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts and other parties in our liquidity and long-term business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors, such as our limited operating history, unfamiliarity with our products, competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles and our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations. Many of these factors are largely outside our control, and any negative perceptions about our long-term business prospects, even if exaggerated or unfounded, would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed. 
 Our plan to expand our network of Tesla stores and galleries, service centers and Superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles or availability of Superchargers.  
 Our plan to expand our network of Tesla stores, galleries, service centers and Superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our vehicles. This ongoing global expansion, which includes planned entry into markets in which we have limited or no experience selling, delivering or servicing vehicles, and which may pose legal, regulatory, cultural and political challenges that we have not previously encountered, may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating.  Furthermore, the increasing number of Model S and Model X vehicles, as well as the significant increase in our vehicle fleet size that we expect from Model 3, will require us to continue to increase the number our Supercharger stations significantly. If we fail to do so, our customers could become dissatisfied, which could adversely affect sales of our vehicles.  We will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale and service of our vehicles and operation of Superchargers in those jurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. If we experience any delays or cannot meet customer expectations in expanding our network of Tesla stores, galleries, service centers and Superchargers, this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.  
 45 

We face risks associated with our international operations and expansion, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions a  nd establishing ourselves in new markets, all of which could harm our business.  
 We currently have international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions that are subject to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Additionally, as part of our growth strategy, we will continue to expand our sales, service and Supercharger locations internationally. We have limited experience, however, selling and servicing our products internationally, as well as limited experience installing and operating Superchargers internationally. Furthermore, international expansion requires us to make significant expenditures, including the establishment of local operating entities, hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of generating any revenue.  
 We are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention. These risks include  conforming our vehicles to various international regulatory and safety requirements, difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations, challenges in attracting customers, foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, our ability to enforce our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls, and preferences of foreign nations for domestically produced vehicles.  
 Additionally, as we have expanded into new international markets, we historically faced challenges with ensuring that our charging equipment works successfully with the charging infrastructure in such markets, including in Norway and China. If customers experience problems with the way our charging equipment works with the local charging infrastructure, or we are unable to adapt our equipment to resolve such problems, then the viability and acceptance of our vehicles in such markets could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. 
 The unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives in the U.S. and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles could have some impact on demand for our vehicles. 
 We currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles. In the United States and abroad, such incentives include, among other things, tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees, the 25% value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. Notably, the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of incentives that are provided to gas-powered vehicles through the oil and gas industries.  Nevertheless, even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted.  For example, on January 1, 2016, a previously available incentive in Denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired and was replaced with a newly phased-in incentive that is less generous than the incentive that it replaced. Moreover, under current regulations, a $7,500 federal tax credit available in the United States for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles with at least 17 kWh of battery capacity, such as our vehicles, will begin to phase out with respect to any vehicles delivered in the second calendar quarter following the quarter in which we deliver our 200,000th qualifying vehicle in the United States. In addition, California implemented regulations phasing out a $2,500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for high-income consumers, which became effective in March 2016. In certain circumstances, there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interests to bring about such developments, which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles. 
 If we are unable to attract and/or retain key employees and hire qualified personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed. 
 The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services, and negatively impact our business, prospects and operating results. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, and JB Straubel, our Chief Technical Officer.  
 None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Key talent may leave Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive expe  rience. Currently in California, there is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles, software engineers, manufacturing engineers and other skilled employees. This competition affects both our abilit  y to retain key employees and hire new ones. Our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner, especially to support our expansion plans and ramp to high-volume manufacture of vehicles, and retain current em  ployees. Additionally, we compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities. Difficulties in retaining current employees   or recruiting new ones could have an adverse effect on our performance.  
 We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer. 
 We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of our Board of Directors and largest stockholder. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies, a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, and Chairman of SolarCity, a solar provider.  
 We are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities.  
 As an automobile manufacturer, we are subject to complex environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the United States and abroad, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials. The costs of compliance, including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended laws, may be significant. We may also face unexpected delays in obtaining permits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities, which would hinder our operation of these facilities. Such costs and delays may adversely impact our business prospects and operating results. Furthermore, any violations of these laws may result in substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, third party damages, or a suspension or cessation of our operations. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.    
 It is common for employees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the United States mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies  operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. 
 Our vehicles are subject to substantial regulation, which is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.  
 Motor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state, and local laws. We incur significant costs in complying with these regulations, and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to such regulations. We are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the import, sale and service of automobiles internationally. For example, in countries outside of the United States, we are required to meet vehicle-specific safety standards that are often materially different from U.S. requirements, thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.  
 Additionally, our vehicles are equipped with a range of autopilot features that assist drivers, relieving them of certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel. Autopilot is a completely new feature with which U.S. and foreign regulators have limited experience. Any current or future proposed regulations in this area, if passed, could impact whether and how our customers are able to use our vehicles equipped for autopilot, and which, depending on the severity of the regulations, could adversely affect our business. 
 47 

We are subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws.   
 Our privacy policy is posted on our website, and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages and other costs. We may also incur substantial expenses and costs in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, in particular data protection laws in the EU, which are currently in a state of transition. Although we take steps to protect the security of our customers  personal information, we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers  personal information. A major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles, and harm to our reputation and brand. 
 We may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions, which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance.  
 Any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. For example, we recently initiated a Model S recall in November 2015 after we discovered a single field unit with a front seat belt issue, and a Model X recall in April 2016 after an internal test revealed unintended movement in the third row seats during a collision.  None of our past recalls have been related to our electric powertrain, and none of the underlying issues has resulted in a vehicle crash or personal injury reported to us. In the future, we may at various times, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our vehicles or our electric powertrain components that we provide to other OEMs, including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers, prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets, as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance. 
 If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Warranty reserves include management s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future. Subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery, we provide four year or 50,000 mile limited warranties for the purchasers of new Model S and Model X vehicles and pre-owned Model S vehicles certified and sold by us. These limited warranties also cover the drive unit for eight years and the battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, depending on the size of the vehicle s battery and/or the date of delivery, although the battery s charging capacity is not covered under these warranties or any Extended Service plan. 
 In addition, customers of new Model S and Model X vehicles have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the limited warranty for their new vehicles to cover additional services for an additional four years or 50,000 miles, provided it is purchased within a specified period of time. The limited warranties and Extended Service plans we offer for the Model S and Model X are subject to certain limitations, exclusions or separate warranties, including certain wear items, such as tires, brake pads, paint and general appearance, and battery performance, and is intended to cover parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems, powertrain and brake system. Additionally, in 2013, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the customer ownership experience, we expanded the battery pack warranty and also eliminated the annual service requirement that was needed to keep the limited warranty on new Model S and Model X vehicles in effect. Should this change in warranty coverage lead to an increase in warranty claims, we may need to record additional warranty reserves, which would negatively affect our profitability.

We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems   and use security measures designed to protect our systems against breaches and cyber-attacks  . If these efforts are not successful, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results and reputation could be harmed.   
 We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems, including implementing new internally developed systems, to assist us in the management of our business. In particular, our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development, maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the U.S. and abroad, which include product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. The implementation, maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement, manufacturing execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service vehicles, or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations. We also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against system security risks, data breaches and cyber-attacks. 
 We cannot be sure that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented, maintained or expanded as planned. If we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired, and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information could be compromised and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions. 
 Our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks. 
 We may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. While we currently maintain general liability, automobile, property, workers  compensation, and directors  and officers  insurance policies, as a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 Our financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to fluctuations in our operating costs. 
 We expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we, among other things, design, develop and manufacture Model 3, energy products and other future products, increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facilities to produce vehicles at higher volumes, including ramping up the production of Model X, develop the Gigafactory, open new Tesla service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities, open new Supercharger locations, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short-term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time. 
 Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles  systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business. 
 Our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality of our vehicles. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our vehicles and their systems. However, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, vehicles and systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles  functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our vehicles via our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerabilities. Accordingly, we have received reports of potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them. However, there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful. 
 49 

Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings. In addition, regardless of their veracity, report  s of unauthorized access to our vehicles, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles, their systems or data are capable of being  hacked,  could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, pro  spects, financial condition and operating results.   We have been the subject of such reports in the past.  
 We may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. 
 The design, manufacture, sale and servicing of automobiles and energy products is a capital intensive business. Until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows, we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles and/or energy products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments. We need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations, continue research and development projects, establish sales and service centers, build and deploy Superchargers, develop the Gigafactory and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicles and energy products. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 
   
 We may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles.  
 We sell our vehicles directly to consumers. We may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the United States as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales model. In certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses, we have opened galleries, which are not full retail locations. 
 The application of these state laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict. Laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so. 
 In addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills and regulations that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. We have also filed a lawsuit in federal court in Michigan challenging the constitutionality of the state s prohibition on direct sales as applied to our business. 
 Internationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. 
 We may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs.  
 Others, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive communications from holders of patents or trademarks regarding their proprietary rights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise assert their rights and urge us to take licenses. In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party s intellectual property rights, we may be required to  cease making, selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, pay substantial damages, seek a license, if available, from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, redesign our products; and/or establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services.  
 In the event that we were required to take one or more such actions, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention. 
 50 

Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters.  
 Our corporate headquarters, the Tesla Factory and the Gigafactory are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada. If major disasters such as earthquakes or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly, our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. We may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness. 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding in aggregate principal amounts $224.3 million of the 2018 Notes, $920.0 million of the 2019 Notes and $1.38 billion of the 2021 Notes.  In addition, we have established a senior secured asset based revolving credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) that allows us to borrow, under certain circumstances, up to $1.0 billion.  As of September 30, 2016, we had $200.0 million in borrowings under the credit facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement. Our substantial indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions.  Finally, during the third quarter of 2016, we also entered into a warehouse credit facility (the  Warehouse Facility ) for a principal amount of up to $300 million.  As of September 30, 2016, we had borrowed $300 million under this facility.  
 Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon conversion of the notes, or to refinance the notes or our borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the Warehouse Facility, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes, the Credit Agreement or the Warehouse Facility, and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the notes or existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the notes, the Credit Agreement, the Warehouse Facility or future indebtedness. 
 Pursuant to their terms, holders may convert their Notes at their option at any time prior to the final three-month period of the scheduled term of the respective Notes only under certain circumstances. For example, holders may generally convert their Notes at their option during a quarter (and only during such quarter) if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for such series of Notes on each applicable trading day. As a result of this conversion feature, the 2018 Notes have been convertible at their holders  option during each quarter commencing with the fourth quarter of 2013, except the first quarter of 2014. Neither this nor any other conversion feature has been met with respect to the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, and consequently the 2019 Notes and 2021 have not been convertible at their holders  option. Upon conversion of the notes, we will be obligated to make cash payments in respect of the principal amounts thereof, and we may also have to deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock, in respect of the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on the notes. For example, as of September 30, 2016, we have repaid in cash approximately $436 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes. Any further conversions of the notes prior to their maturity, or acceleration of the repayment of the notes or future indebtedness after any applicable notice or grace periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, holders of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted. In addition, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to purchase notes at a time when the purchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. 
 51 

Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.   
 The terms of our Credit Facility contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things,  incur additional debt or issue guarantees, create liens, repurchase stock or make other restricted payments, and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio.   
 As a result of these  covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us. In addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.   
 We may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions, which would intensify the risks discussed immediately above. 
 We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our Credit Facility, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing our convertible senior notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes and under the Credit Agreement when due. If we incur any additional debt, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify. 
 The classification of our convertible senior notes may have a material effect on our reported financial results. 
 As described in the Risk Factor   Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness,   our 2018 Notes have been historically, and our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes may become in the future, convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances. If holders elect to convert their notes, we could be required to pay them significant amounts in cash and/or deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock. Certain holders with respect to a significant portion of our 2018 Notes have exercised their conversion rights, and other holders of our notes may do so in the future. Even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, the notes become convertible prior to their scheduled maturity dates, we would be required to reclassify such notes and the related debt issuance costs as current liabilities and certain portions of our equity outside of equity to mezzanine equity, which would have an adverse impact on our reported financial results for such quarter, and could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. 
 Risks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock 
 The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile. 
 The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced an intra-day trading high of $269.34 per share and a low of $141.05 per share over the last 52 weeks. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies  stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. For example, a shareholder litigation like this was filed against us in 2013. While the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs  complaint with prejudice, this litigation (if the trial court s order is successfully appealed) or others like it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources. 
 52 

Conversion of our converti  ble senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.  
 The conversion of some or all of our convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the notes. As described in the Risk Factor   Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt,   our convertible senior notes have been historically, and may become in the future, convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances. If holders elect to convert their notes, we could be required to pay them significant amounts in cash and/or deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock. Certain holders with respect to a significant portion of our 2018 Notes have exercised their conversion rights, and other holders of our notes may do so in the future. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. 
 The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible senior notes may affect the value of the notes and our common stock. 
 In connection with each issuance of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlay the applicable notes. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable notes. We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates. 
 In addition, the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the applicable notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes. 
 We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the prices of the notes or the shares of our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the hedge counterparties have engaged or will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. 
 Mr. Musk has pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain bank borrowings. If Mr. Musk were forced to sell these shares pursuant to a margin call that he could not avoid or satisfy, such sales could cause our stock price to decline. 
 Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third party participants in such offerings and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially and Mr. Musk were unable to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged shares, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. 
 Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a takeover attempt. 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In addition, the terms of the convertible senior notes require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.

   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

The Warehouse SUBI Collection Account shall be an Eligible Account used only for the collection of the amounts and for application of such amounts as described in  Section 2.04  of this Agreement.  The Warehouse SUBI Collection Account will be an Eligible Account established pursuant to a Control Agreement with respect to which the Administrative Agent shall, at all times, be an Entitlement Holder or purchaser with Control and will bear a designation to clearly indicate that the funds and Financial Assets deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Administrative Agent.

  SUBI Servicing Agreement (but may, at the Administrative Agent s option, retain the services of   [***]   as subservicer), and (ii) following the occurrence of an Event of Default (and in no event before the occurrence of an Event of Default), the Administrative Agent shall, at the request, or may with the consent, of the Group Agents, exercise its rights and remedies under the Control Agreements relating to the Reserve Account and the Warehouse SUBI Collection Account and as otherwise contemplated herein.  In addition, following the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Loan Balance shall accrue interest at the Default Rate in accordance with   Section 2.02  .    
 (b)  In addition to all rights and remedies under this Agreement or otherwise, the Administrative Agent shall have all other rights and remedies provided under the Relevant UCC and under other applicable laws, which rights shall be cumulative.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an Event of Default has occurred and has not been waived, the Administrative Agent may, without being required to give any notice (except as herein provided or as may be required by mandatory provisions of law), sell the Collateral or any part thereof in any commercially reasonable manner at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, and at such price or prices as the Administrative Agent may deem satisfactory.  The Borrower will execute and deliver such documents and take such other action as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems necessary or advisable in order that any such sale may be made in compliance with applicable law.  Upon any such sale, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to deliver, assign and transfer to the purchaser thereof the Collateral so sold.  Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the Collateral so sold to it absolutely and free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity or right of redemption of the Borrower which may be waived, and the Borrower, to the extent permitted by applicable law, hereby specifically waives all rights of redemption, stay or appraisal which it has or may have under any law now existing or hereafter adopted.  The Administrative Agent, instead of exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, shall, at the direction, or may with the consent, of the Group Agents proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose the security interests in the Collateral and sell the Collateral, or any portion thereof, under a judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent jurisdiction.

 (i)  to demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for any and all monies due or to become due thereon or by virtue thereof, 
 (ii)  to settle, compromise, compound, prosecute or defend any action or proceeding with respect thereto, 
 (iii)  to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise deal in or with the Collateral or the proceeds or avails thereof, as fully and effectually as if the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof, and

    (iv)    to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to make any allowance and other adjustments with reference thereto;  
  provided  that the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower at least ten (10) days prior written notice of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition of any of the Collateral is to be made.  The Borrower agrees that such notice constitutes  reasonable authenticated notification  within the meaning of Section 9-611(b) of the UCC (or other section of similar content of the Relevant UCC). 
 (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if at any time the rights, powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent following the occurrence of an Event of Default conflict (or are inconsistent) with the rights and obligations of the Servicer, the rights, powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent shall supersede the rights and obligations of the Servicer to the extent of such conflict (or inconsistency), with the express intent of maximizing the rights, powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent following the occurrence of an Event of Default. 
 (e)  The Administrative Agent agrees with the Borrower, with respect to any Control Agreement and the related deposit or securities account, that the Administrative Agent will not deliver a  Notice of Exclusive Control  or  Access Termination Notice  (as defined in such Control Agreement) to the applicable securities intermediary or account bank except after an Event of Default has occurred that has not been waived. 
 (f)  The parties hereto acknowledge that this Agreement is, and is intended to be, a contract to extend financial accommodations to the Borrower within the meaning of Section 365(e)(2)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any amended or successor provision thereof or any amended or successor code).

No Group Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Servicer Default, Default or Event of Default unless such Group Agent has received notice from the Administrative Agent, any other Group Agent, any Lender, the Servicer or the Borrower stating that a Servicer Default, Default or Event of Default has occurred hereunder and describing such Servicer Default, Default or Event of Default.  If a Group Agent receives such a notice, it shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders in its Group and to the Administrative Agent (but only if such notice received by such Group Agent was not sent by the Administrative Agent).  A Group Agent may take such action concerning a Servicer Default, Default or Event of Default as may be directed by Committed Lenders in its Group representing a majority of the Commitments in such Group (subject to the other provisions of this  Article X ), but until such Group Agent receives such directions, such Group Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as such Group Agent deems advisable and in the best interests of the Conduit Lenders and Committed Lenders in its Group. 
   SECTION 10.08   Non-Reliance on Group Agent and Other Parties .  Except to the extent otherwise agreed to in writing between a Lender and its Group Agent, each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Group Agent for its Group nor any of such Group Agent s directors, officers, agents or employees has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by such Group Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Tesla Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by such Group Agent.  Each Lender represents and warrants to the Group Agent for its Group that, independently and without reliance upon such Group Agent, any other Group Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, it has made and will continue to make its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, prospects, financial and other conditions and creditworthiness of the Tesla Parties and the Warehouse SUBI Assets and its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to take, or omit, action under any Transaction Document.  Except for items expressly required to be delivered under any Transaction Document by a Group Agent to any Lender in its Group, no Group Agent shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender in its Group with any information concerning the Tesla Parties or any of their Affiliates that comes into the possession of such Group Agent or any of its directors, officers, agents, employees, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

Any Group Agent may, upon at least thirty (30) days  notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Servicer and the Lenders in its Group, resign as Group Agent for its Group.  Such resignation shall not become effective until a successor Group Agent is appointed in the manner prescribed by the relevant Liquidity Agreement (if any) or, in the absence of any provisions in such Liquidity Agreement providing for the appointment of a successor Group Agent, until a successor Group Agent is appointed by the Conduit Lender(s) in such Group (with the consent of Committed Lenders representing a majority of the Commitments in such Group) and such successor Group Agent has accepted such appointment.  If no successor Group Agent shall have been so appointed within thirty (30) days after the departing Group Agent s giving of notice of resignation, then the departing Group Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders in its Group, appoint a successor Group Agent for such Group, which successor Group Agent shall have short-term debt ratings of at least  A-1  from S P and  P-1  from Moody s and shall be either a commercial bank having a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000 or an Affiliate of such an institution.  Upon such acceptance of its appointment as Group Agent for such Group hereunder by a successor Group Agent, such successor Group Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the resigning Group Agent, and the resigning Group Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Transaction Documents.  After any resigning Group Agent s resignation hereunder, the provisions of   Article XI   and this   Article X   shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was a Group Agent.  
   SECTION 10.10   Reliance on Group Agent .  Unless otherwise advised in writing by a Group Agent or by any Lender in such Group Agent s Group, each party to this Agreement may assume that (i) such Group Agent is acting for the benefit and on behalf of each of the Lenders in its Group, as well as for the benefit of each assignee or other transferee from any such Person, and (ii) each action taken by such Group Agent has been duly authorized and approved by all necessary action on the part of the Lenders in its Group.

   (c)  Promptly upon receipt by an Indemnified Party under this  Section 11.01  of notice of the commencement of any suit, action, claim, proceeding or governmental investigation against such Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Borrower or TFL (each an   Indemnifying Party  ) under this Section, promptly notify the applicable Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement. Such Indemnified Party s failure or delay to so promptly notify such Indemnifying Party shall not limit the obligations of such Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party in respect of such claim except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced in its defense of such claim by such failure or delay.  The applicable Indemnifying Party may participate in and assume the defense of any such suit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation at its expense, and no settlement thereof shall be made without the approval of such Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party.

  After notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its intention to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and so long as the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense thereof in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any legal expenses of counsel for such Indemnified Party unless there shall be a conflict between the interests of the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party, in which case such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel to represent it at the Indemnifying Party s expense.  If the Indemnifying Party shall have made any indemnity payments pursuant to this   Section 11.01   and such Indemnified Party thereafter collects any of such amounts from others, such Indemnified Party shall promptly repay such amounts to the Indemnifying Party, without interest (except to the extent interest is received by such Indemnified Party).  
   SECTION 11.02   Tax Indemnification .   
 (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 (b)  The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 (c)  The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of another Lender Party, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
   (d)  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of  Section 12.10(h)  relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to

  such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d).  
 (e)  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this  Section 11.02 , the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 (f) (i)  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments made hereunder shall deliver to the Servicer, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Servicer, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Servicer, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Servicer, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Servicer, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in  Section 11.02(f)(ii)(A) ,  (ii)(B) , and  (ii)(D)  below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  
 (ii)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: 
 (A)  any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Servicer, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Servicer, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax.   
   (B)  Any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time

 (2)  executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; or 
 (3)  in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a certificate substantially to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN-E. 
 (C)  Any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
   (D)  If a payment made to a Recipient under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Recipient were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Recipient shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply

  with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Recipient has complied with such Recipient s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.    
 Any Administrative Agent or Group Agent that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Servicer executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Person is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax (in each case, if such form was not provided pursuant to  Section 11.02(f)(ii)(A)  above).  Any Administrative Agent or Group Agent that is not a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Servicer (and in the case of a Group Agent, to the Administrative Agent) two duly completed executed originals of Form W-8IMY certifying that it is a  U.S. branch  and that the payments it receives for the account of others hereunder are not effectively connected with the conduct of its trade or business in the United States and that such Form W-8IMY evidences its agreement with the Borrower to be treated as a  United States person  with respect to such payments (in each case, pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.1441-1T(b)(2)(iv)). 
 Each Recipient agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.   
   SECTION 11.03   Additional Costs .   
   (a) The Borrower shall pay to each Indemnified Party from time to time as specified in   Section 11.04 , such amounts reasonably necessary to compensate it for any increase in costs which are attributable to its funding a Loan or being committed to fund the same under this Agreement, or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Indemnified Party hereunder, under a Loan in respect of any such purchase or funding obligation (such increases in costs, payments and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called   Additional Costs  ) resulting from any Regulatory Requirement and which (i) imposes any tax on, or changes the method or basis of taxation of, any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement in respect of any such purchase or funding (in each case) excluding (x) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, (y) Connection Income Taxes, and (z) Indemnified Taxes, (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, deposit insurance or assessment, capital or similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or credit extended by such Indemnified Party or (iii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities);  provided  that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate an Indemnified Party pursuant to this  Section 11.03  for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than twelve (12) months prior to the date that such Indemnified Party notifies the Borrower of the Regulatory Requirement giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Indemnified Party s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Regulatory Requirement giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the twelve-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). Each of the Borrower and the Servicer acknowledges that any Indemnified Party may implement, as an internal institutional

  matter, measures in anticipation of a final or proposed Regulatory Requirement (including, without limitation, the imposition of internal charges on such Indemnified Party s interest or obligations under this Agreement) and may commence recognizing the incurrence of charges by and seeking compensation under this Section 11.03(a) in connection with such measures, in advance of the effective date of such final or proposed Regulatory Requirement, and each of the Borrower and the Servicer agrees that such charges or compensation shall be payable, but only to the extent funds are then or thereafter become available therefor pursuant to Section 2.04(c) of this Agreement following demand therefor without regard to whether such proposed Regulatory Requirement has been adopted or whether such effective date has occurred.  
 (b) If any Indemnified Party has or anticipates having any claim for Additional Costs from the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.03(a), and such Indemnified Party believes that having the facility evidenced by this Agreement publicly rated by a credit rating agency would reduce the amount of such Additional Costs (such amount    Reduction Amount  ) by an amount deemed by such Indemnified Party to be material, such Indemnified Party shall provide written notice to the Borrower and the Servicer (a   Ratings Request  ) that such Indemnified Party intends to request public ratings of the facility from a credit rating agency selected by such Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to the Servicer (the   Facility Rating  ).  The Borrower and the Servicer agree that they shall cooperate with such Indemnified Party s efforts to obtain a Facility Rating within 60 days of such request, and shall provide the applicable credit rating agency (either directly or through distribution to the Administrative Agent or such Indemnified Party), any information requested by such credit rating agency for purposes of providing and monitoring the Facility Rating.  The Indemnified Party requesting the ratings shall pay the initial fees payable to the credit rating agency for providing the rating and all ongoing fees payable to the credit rating agency to the extent not paid by the Servicer. The Servicer shall pay such ongoing fees payable to the credit rating agency for its continued monitoring of the rating up to the Reduction Amount.  Nothing in this Section 11.03(b) shall preclude any Indemnified Party from demanding compensation from the Issuer pursuant to Section 11.03(a) hereof at any time and without regard to whether a Facility Rating shall have been obtained, or shall require any Indemnified Party to obtain any ratings on the facility prior to demanding any such compensation from the Borrower.  Any Facility Rating obtained pursuant to this Section 11.03(b) is exclusively for purposes of Section 11.03 and shall not amend or modify any other term or provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. 
   SECTION 11.04   Procedures for Indemnification; Etc . 
   (a)  Each Indemnified Party agrees to promptly notify the Borrower or TFL, as the case may be, of (i) any event of which it has knowledge which will entitle such Person to compensation or indemnification from the Borrower or TFL and (ii) any potential tax assessment of which it has knowledge by any tax authority for which the Borrower may be liable pursuant to  Section 11.02(c)  or  11.03 . Such Indemnified Party s failure or delay to so promptly notify such Indemnifying Party shall not limit the obligations of such Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party in respect of such claim except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced in its defense of such claim by such failure or delay.  Any such notice claiming compensation or indemnification hereunder shall, if applicable, set forth in reasonable detail and in good faith the amount or amounts to be paid to such Indemnified Party hereunder and shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount,

  such Indemnified Party may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  The Borrower or TFL, as the case may be, shall pay each claim for compensation for which it is liable under   Section 11.02(c)   or   11.03   on the first Payment Date which is at least ten (10) days after notice of such claim is given to the Borrower or TFL, as the case may be.  
 (b)  Each Indemnified Party agrees that it will use reasonable efforts to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any claim for indemnity pursuant to  Section 11.02  or  11.03  including, subject to applicable law, a change in the funding office of such Indemnified Party;  provided ,  however , that nothing contained herein shall obligate such Indemnified Party to take any action that imposes on such Indemnified Party any material additional costs or any legal or regulatory burdens, nor which, in such Indemnified Party s sole discretion, would have an adverse effect on its business, operations or financial condition. 
 (c)  If any Indemnified Party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to  Section 11.02  or  Section 11.03 , it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under  Section 11.02  or  Section 11.03  with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Indemnified Party, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Official Body with respect to such refund),  provided  that the Borrower, upon the request of such Indemnified Party, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Official Body) to such Indemnified Party in the event such Indemnified Party is required to repay such refund to such Official Body.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will any Indemnified Party be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place such Indemnified Party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Indemnified Party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.

 (1)  except for an assignment by a Committed Lender to any Lender or any Affiliate of any Committed Lender, each such assignment shall require the prior written consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed;  provided ,  however , that such consent of the Borrower shall not be required if an Event of Default, Default or Servicer Default has occurred and is continuing); 
 (2)  each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement; 
 (3)  the amount being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than the lesser of (x) $5,000,000 and (y) all of the assigning Committed Lender s Commitment; and,

  remaining portion of an assigning Committed Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Committed Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

 (e)   Register .  The Administrative Agent shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain at its address referred to on the signature page of this Agreement (or such other address of the Administrative Agent notified by the Administrative Agent to the other parties hereto) a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Committed Lenders and the Conduit Lenders, the Commitment Amount of each Committed Lender and the aggregate outstanding principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans of each Conduit Lender and Committed Lender from time to time (the   Register  ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Servicer, the Administrative Agent, the Group Agents, the Conduit Lenders and the Committed Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Committed Lender or Conduit Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Servicer, any Group Agent, any Conduit Lender or any Committed Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
 (f)   Procedure .  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement executed and delivered by an assigning Committed Lender and an Eligible Assignee or assignee Committed Lender, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement has been duly completed, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register, and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and the Servicer.

Each Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more Eligible Assignees (each, a   Participant  ) participating interests in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the Loans.  Notwithstanding any such sale by such Lender of participating interests to a Participant, (i) such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance hereof and thereof, and (iii) the Borrower and the Servicer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Loans.  Each Lender agrees that any agreement between such Lender and any such Participant in respect of such participating interest shall not restrict or condition such Lender s right to agree to any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification of this Agreement.  The Borrower and the Servicer agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of  Article XI  (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under  Section 11.02(f)  to the same extent as if such Participant were a Lender and had acquired such participation pursuant to an assignment), it being understood that the documentation required under  Section 11.02(f)  shall be delivered to the participating Lender to the same extent as if such Participant was a Lender

  and had acquired such Participation pursuant to an assignment;   provided   that all such amounts payable by the Borrower or the Servicer to any such Participant shall be limited to the amounts which would have been payable to such Lender selling such participating interest had such interest not been sold;   provided further   that such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of   Section 11.04   as if it were a Lender.  
  (h)    Participant Register  .  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the    Participant Register      provided   that no Committed Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any this Agreement) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  
 (i)   Assignments by Agents .  This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Administrative Agent and each Group Agent herein shall be assignable by the Administrative Agent or such Group Agent, as the case may be, and its successors and assigns;  provided  that in the case of an assignment to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Administrative Agent or such Group Agent, so long as no Event of Default, Default or Servicer Default has occurred and is continuing, such assignment shall require the Borrower s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 (i) The Borrower may, from time to time, with the written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Group Agent, add additional Persons as Lenders (either to an existing Group or by creating new Groups). Each new Lender (or Group) shall become a party hereto, by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, an assumption agreement (each, an    Assumption Agreement  ) in the form of  Exhibit N  hereto (which Assumption Agreement shall, in the case of any new Lender or Lenders, be executed by each Person in such new Lender s Group).   
   (ii) The Borrower may, from time to time, with the written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Group Agent, request that the then existing Committed Lenders increase their respective Commitment Amounts (and accordingly the Facility Limit) on a pro rata basis according to their respective Percentages of the aggregate amount of increases in Commitment Amounts requested.  Each existing Committed Lender may in its discretion agree to all or

  part of such pro rata increase of its Commitment.  If any existing Committed Lender does not agree to increase its Commitment Amount or agrees to increase its Commitment Amount by an amount that is less than its Percentage of the aggregate amount of increases in Commitment Amounts requested by the Borrower, then the Borrower may effect such portion of the requested increase in Commitment Amounts not agreed to by an existing Committed Lender by adding additional Persons as Lenders (either to an existing Group or by creating new Groups) to undertake Commitments or obtaining the agreement of another existing Committed Lender to increase its Commitment Amount on a greater than pro rata basis;   provided  ,   however  , that the Commitment of any existing Lender may only be increased with the prior written consent of such Lender.

    eOriginal, Inc. Authoritative Copy System Description  
 Utilizing eOriginal SmartSign    Web Signature Solution 
   
 The eContract  Processes Background  
 The  eOriginal, Inc. Authoritative Copy System (the    System   ) licensed by or on behalf of Originator enables the fully electronic creation, execution and management of Authoritative Copies and uses  a combination of technological and administrative features in order to: (i) designate a single copy of the Record or Records comprising an  eContract  as being  the  Authoritative Copy of such eContract; (ii) manage access to and the rendering of the Authoritative Copy; (iii) identify each entity  who has authorized access to the System, (each such entity, a    System User     (iv) identify which System User or third party that is not a System User (each such third party, a   Non-System User  ) is the Owner of Record  of the Authoritative Copy ; and (v) provide a means for transferring record ownership of, and the exclusive right of access to, the Authoritative Copy from the  current  Owner of Record to a successor Owner of Record  (the processes performed by the System to execute the functions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v) are collectively referred to as the    eContract Processes   ) . The System comprises a Production System and a Back-up System. The Production System is accessible to System Users as described herein and represents that portion of the System of which the Vault is a part. The Production System is backed-up onto the Back-up System as described in Section J .1.  below .  The System gives each System User and each Authoritative Copy a unique identification number and maintains such unique identification numbers in the System s administrative database.  
 The System enables the fully electronic creation, execution and management of Authoritative Copies, including ancillary electronic Records which amend, modify, support and/or supplement Authoritative Copies (collectively,   eDocuments  ), and the logical association of each of the eDocuments with the applicable Authoritative Copy. The System also enables the conversion of Authoritative Copies and related eDocuments from electronic media to paper media, and the conversion of Chattel Paper and ancillary documents from paper media to electronic media for management within the System as Authoritative Copies and eDocuments.

    TESLA FINANCE CREDIT AND COLLECTIONS POLICY  
 1.  MISSION AND PHILOSOPHY 
 The purpose of the credit and collections policy is to provide Tesla Finance LLC (also referred to as Tesla Finance or TFL) with an organized and repeatable practice of credit adjudication and portfolio management practices in support of Tesla vehicle sales and profitability, brand experience and loyalty. TFL underwrites credit decisions on behalf of, and acts as the servicer for, Tesla Lease Trust (TLT). This policy helps establish authority, rules, process and the framework to originate, manage, and liquidate the lease portfolio effectively. It is based on sound and established lending and collection practices while operating within the limitations of regulatory requirements. It is, however, not a comprehensive interpretation of specific laws and regulations governing the business but is, rather, a high- to medium-level discussion of intent, practice, and compliance. 
 While certain roles have specific functional responsibilities, risk management generally is a shared responsibility across the organization. Although credit and collections are distinctly separate functions in the product lifecycle, it is imperative that there be full alignment, communication, and transparency on overall goals, actions, and performance of the portfolio. This is accomplished through a regular and frequent feedback loop between the two functions at the appropriate levels.  
 This policy is intended to serve as a basic and practical manual. However, no document can fully replace: prudent business judgment; sound assessment of a borrower s ability, capacity, and willingness to pay; or effective decision making about a specific credit request or delinquency resolution activity that is appropriate to the situation and the needs of both the borrower and TFL. The roles and incentives of the various functions are designed to provide the appropriate alignment, unity of purpose, and check and balance to maximize the benefit to the company. 
 2.  CREDIT POLICY 

A.   
 
 Covered Products    

   The Tesla Lease product covers individual and joint consumer leasing, small business leasing and commercial leasing. Consumer leasing is intended for consumers   individually and jointly   who wish to lease their Tesla vehicle. Small business leasing is intended for owners and principals of small and medium sized enterprises who wish to lease a vehicle jointly with their business. This may allow the flexibility to deduct some or all of lease payments from business income taxes (customers are always encouraged to consult with a tax professional to understand their own particular situation and eligibility). The lessee will be the business and the co-lessee will be the business owner or principal. Credit worthiness will be solely evaluated based on the co-lessee, who is the business owner or principal. Commercial leasing is a product offered to  
 [***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 
 
 Confidential Treatment Requested by Tesla Motors, Inc. 
   
  well established and significant sized businesses who wish to lease in the company s name only and with no co-buyer. This allows for the corporate tax benefits of leasing and these vehicles are often for the use of C-suite executives. This product is offered on a limited basis upon request.   

B.   
 
 General Policy Statement    

 TFL s policy is to review and consider all applications for Leases submitted on the MyTesla portal and processed through the Loan/Lease Origination System (LOS) using an appropriate risk/reward balance. The goal of credit decisioning is to approve credit applications with an acceptable probability of payment by considering the following: 

A complete credit application,     

A thorough credit review and analysis in support of the four facets of a good credit approval (Ability, Stability, Credit History, and Deal Structure), and     

Proper communication, follow up, and documentation.     

C.   
 
 Risk Framework and Appetite    

 TFL accepts risks generally in line with those of other U.S. captive auto finance companies. Our approach to risk management is based on these guiding principles: 

Innovative support of Tesla sales, profitability, and brand experience     

Strike appropriate risk/reward balance     

Forward looking analytics with timely feedback loop     

Robust governance and compliance     

Overall - Sound business judgment rules!     

 Credit Risk Appetite:  Credit risk is the possibility of losses stemming from the failure of lessees to meet their financial obligations under the lease agreement. Overall, TFL s credit risk appetite for the lease portfolio is defined by a [***] of [***] and [***] of [***]. The credit policy parameters (discussed in section 2F) with [***] on [***] and [***] of [***] of [***] along with the [***] are setup to ensure that risk exposure and portfolio performance are at acceptable levels.  
 Concentration Risk:  Our leasing portfolio concentration follows that of our general business model distribution with new Tesla vehicles including Model S and Model X. Our model mix is expected to shift and grow with the introduction of new products, such as Model III. Sales are [***] in [***] and this distribution will be monitored and managed dependent on business and market conditions.   
 [***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 
 
 Confidential Treatment Requested by Tesla Motors, Inc. 
   
    Qualitative Risk factors:   The qualitative elements of the risk appeti  te framework define, in general,   the   positioning that TFL s   management wishes to adopt or maintain in the course of its business model. Generally speaking, the framework is based on maintaining the following qualitative objectives:  

A [***] and predictable risk profile based on a simple and transparent business model, focused primarily on retail customers,     

A stable and consistent credit policy and practice to generate growth, earnings and manage volatility,       

An independent risk function with active involvement of senior management that guarantees a strong risk culture focused on protecting and ensuring an adequate return on capital, and     

Focus on the business model and products that TFL knows sufficiently well and has the management capacity (people, systems, processes) to execute successfully.        

D.   
 
 Credit Department Roles and Responsibilities    

 The credit function is headed by the President of Tesla Finance. Credit Analysis is performed by the Underwriting Department and is authorized to make credit decisions per the credit criteria specified in this policy.  
 The Underwriting Department evaluates and identifies the risk and merits of each application on a case by case basis. The Credit Analysts are experienced and trained professionals whose primary role is to make a credit decision after conducting a full analysis of the applicant s credit worthiness within established underwriting guidelines in compliance with fair lending and other applicable regulations. Credit Specialists are a part of the broader Financial Services team and function as the primary interface with the customer, Sales Advisors and Delivery Specialists in the field, and internal teams on matters related to contracts, documents, communication and follow-up. The department is required to consult with, and escalate, deals to more senior members of the Underwriting team on approvals above the specified limits.

E.   
 
        CREDIT DECISIONING     

i.   
 
 Complete Credit Application:     

 To enable a well-rounded credit decision, a complete credit application refers to thorough and accurate information as it pertains to the applicant s income, financial resources and assets, employment and residence history, credit obligations and payment history, and the amount of credit desired as it relates to the vehicle configuration and options. The application specifically needs to contain: 

Information regarding the applicant(s)      

Valid SSN (US), SIN (Optional in Canada) or Tax ID number     

Asset and debt (liability) information     

Vehicle price details     

Any trade-in, capitalized tax or additional down payments that impact the capitalized cost     

 The credit application information is supplemented with the consumer credit bureau record of the applicant s credit borrowing and payment history. 
 For the purposes of this policy, a credit application is considered incomplete when there is insufficient information to make a fully informed credit decision. Common reasons contributing to an incomplete credit application are: 

SSN is not accurate or does not match true applicant      

Applicant / co-applicant did not have sufficient time, desire, or available information to complete all sections at  credit application or upon follow up     

 An incomplete credit application can be decisioned as pending (Manual Review) or declined with  Credit Application Incomplete  noted in the adverse action letter. If the applicant provides the requested information, the credit department can continue to process the application through the normal process. If the applicant does not provide the requested information after reasonable attempts to obtain this information are exhausted, the adverse action notice should be sent and no further action is needed.  
   Requesting information from the applicant/co-applicant:  When insufficient information is received, or additional information is needed to support the credit decision process, the credit department may follow up with the applicant(s), their legally authorized representatives, or Tesla sales /delivery personnel as appropriate. The credit department associates may not ask, discuss, infer, or consider prohibited bases such as an applicant s Race, Color, Religion, Ethnic  Origin, Age (if legally eligible to contract), Sex and marital status, public assistance usage with the applicant or any other individual involved in the credit transaction. Inquiries regarding the applicant s

  immigration status are permissible only to ascertain TFL s rights and remedies regarding contractual repayments and end of lease termination activities.     This policy applies to all verbal, written, in person, and electronic communication methods used during the process.  

ii.   
 
 Credit Bureau History:     

 Credit history is a measure of the borrower s creditworthiness evidenced through their current and past borrowing and payment performance. An accurate and valid SSN is crucial for pulling the right credit record. For Canadian customers, while having an accurate SIN is helpful for locating a credit file, consumers are not required to provide one. The major components of the consumer bureau report are: 

FICO Score     

Length and performance of tradelines     

Inquiries     

Bankruptcy and public record information     

 TFL uses the [***], a score [***]. TFL s primary source for [***] is [***] in the United States. 

iii.   
 
 Lease  [***]  System:      

 The advantages of using [***] and grades in lending include consistency, a quick turnaround, and uniform risk assessment and monitoring. [***] are [***] into [***] based on [***] and [***] the [***] into [***] as shown below. 
 [***] 

iv.   
 
 Unscored Applications    

 An unscored credit file signifies that there is not enough information available to compute a statistically-valid credit score or that there was no credit bureau record found. Applicants without a FICO score will be considered but supplemental documentation will likely be required including but not limited to: proof of income, proof of assets, and/or proof of home ownership and/or a higher down payment to mitigate a lack of established credit history. Unscored applications may occur when a customer is new to the country, when they have not used credit actively in for many years, or when the applicant is a business. 

v.   
 
 Credit Analysis:    

   A thorough credit analysis covers all the information provided on the credit application, vehicle pricing, and the credit bureau report. In addition, there may be discussions with the applicant regarding, but not limited to, verification of income and residence, contact

i.   
 
 Adverse Action Reasons:    

 The LOS displays the designated decline reasons or stipulations selected at the time the application is decisioned. For consistency and accuracy the credit department will check only [***] reasons for the credit request denial or counter from the list below. 
 [***] 
 The [***] is a critical, but not the only, component of sound judgmental credit decisioning. 

F.   
 
 Lending  [***] , Authority and Exceptions    

 Lease Credit Approval Authority:  
   
 [***] 

Authority levels will be assigned based on experience and performance and represent the maximum an analyst is permitted to approve     

If multiple applicants,   [***]   is based on   [***]   of the   [***]     

Exceptions above these guidelines must be approved by   [***]   of   [***]

 [***] and [***] will generally require additional support, but will be considered for approval if [***] indicate [***]. In many cases [***] may be required, but in order to provide [***] experience consistent with the Tesla brand, Credit Analysts operate with the goal of identifying and documenting [***] while [***]. As part of this process, applications are reviewed for [***] supporting [***]. This includes: [***]. It is the responsibility of the Credit Analyst to determine what is [***] in the context of a credit request. All findings will be well documented within the LOS. 

ii.   
 
 Unscored    

 See above. 

iii.   
 
 Commercial Leasing    

 Commercial leases will be underwritten based on the strength of the commercial entity since there is no consumer co-buyer as there is in small business leases.  
 General characteristics of companies that will be considered for a commercial lease include: 
 [***] 
 Commercial Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria and compared to the industry average as reported by [***]: 
 [***] 
 Supplemental information may be requested and will be considered if provided such as trade references and bank ratings. 

iv.   
 
 Auto Decisioning    

 Automated decisioning serves to improve efficiency and maintain uniformity of decisions across applications. Automated decisioning has been set up within TFL s LOS. The logic generally checks the same variables evaluated in judgmental credit decisions made by a live analyst.  
 [***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 
 
 Confidential Treatment Requested by Tesla Motors, Inc. 
   
    It is important to note that auto approvals eliminate the need for manual review of the strongest segment of applications. This allows Credit Analysts to spend more time working on and investigating the remaining deals requiring a judgmental credit decision.  
 Auto decisioning is maintained by TFL s LOS System Administrator and will be reviewed periodically to ensure decisions are consistent with the Credit Policy. Accordingly, the System Administrator may update and adjust the logic, with authorization from TFL s President, to remain in line with business needs while remaining compliant the Credit Policy and lending regulations. 
 Auto Approval Logic: 
   
 [***] 
 Auto Decline Logic: 
   
 [***] 

In the case of a joint consumer applicant, [***] must [***] or [***] to result in an automated decision     

v.   
 
 High Credit Risk Applications:    

 All credit applications with [***] are generally considered high risk and require the following investigations: 

Proof of Employment      

Proof of Income/assets     

Proof of Residence     

Personal Cell number     

References     

vi.   
 
 Potential Skip/Fraud Applications:    

 Fraud detection is a challenging and rapidly changing phenomenon in lending businesses that requires an agile and measured response. To minimize the approval of potential fraudulent and skip hazards, the analyst must perform a careful examination of any credit application that often indicate one or more of the following characteristics: 

Unverifiable, unsubstantiated, and questionable information     

Aliases commonly used and reversed     

References with incomplete information     

 [***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 
 
 Confidential Treatment Requested by Tesla Motors, Inc. 

Short time in residence and employment     

Inconsistencies or facts not adding up to the overall application profile     

 Proper diligence should be used in analyzing the above factors in compliance with all applicable laws.  

vii.   
 
 Down Payment and Trade-ins:     

 A down payment serves to improve TFL s equity position in the vehicle, lower the applicant debt and payment to income ratios and increases the applicant s vested interest in the transaction. There are no mandatory down payment requirements other than the deposits for ordering the vehicle and for the leasing program. Security deposits are not currently required in the leasing program. However, the credit decision may include a stipulation of additional down payment to qualify the customer for the lease. 
 A net negative down payment exists when the value of the trade-in adds to the capitalized cost of the leased vehicle and there is not an adequate cash down payment to offset the amount. When this condition exists, the credit analyst must evaluate the potential impact to TFL s equity position. 

viii.   
 
 Exception Authority and Process:    

 TFL may consider applications from borrowers whose credit profile does not fit within the provisions of this lending policy on a case by case basis.  Any exception to this policy must be for the clear benefit of TFL, meet the standards for review and approval of exception leases established by this policy, and be approved by [***] and documented in the LOS. A written justification that clearly sets forth all the relevant credit factors that support the underwriting decision is needed to support the application approval.  
 Additionally, it is the responsibility of the risk department to: 

Monitor compliance with this policy,     

Track the aggregate level of exceptions to help detect shifts in the risk characteristics of that element(s) within the lending portfolio, and     

Regularly analyze aggregate exception levels and report them to Senior Management.  An excessive volume or a pattern of exceptions may signal an unintended or unwarranted relaxation of TFL s underwriting standards.     

   When viewed individually, underwriting exceptions may not appear to increase risk significantly. However, when aggregated, even well mitigated exceptions increase portfolio risk to TFL, especially under adverse business and economic conditions. When higher risk approvals are made from on an exception basis from sound and normal underwriting policies, it is policy to make them only in limited amounts and only when  
 [***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 
 
 Confidential Treatment Requested by Tesla Motors, Inc. 
   
  robust risk management practices are in place to manage and control the higher risk.   Exceptions are   [***]   and will   [***]   based on   [***].  
 Applicants with [***] present a significant default risk.  TFL will consider applicants with [***] with [***], and strong supporting evidence that [***]. Exceptions may be made if the applicant [***]. Adequate documentation to support such an approval is required which should include a direct in depth conversation with the applicant to gather all the material facts. 
 G.  Fair Lending and Regulatory Compliance 

i.   
 
 General Policy Statement:    

 It is TFL s policy to follow sound lending practices in letter and spirit to comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws. The Credit department will be trained and required to comply with all applicable regulations at the federal, state, and local level. In regards to Fair Lending, we will not discriminate in our treatment of any credit applications with respect to the following prohibited basis: 

(1)   
 
  race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);     

(2)   
 
  because all or part of the applicant s income derives from any public assistance program; or    

(3)   
 
  because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.    

 In addition to Fair Lending, the following regulations generally apply to TFL s leasing activities: 

Consumer Leasing Act (Reg. M)     

FCRA and Adverse Action Notice     

OFAC     

Red Flag / ID theft     

California Credit Score Disclosure      

Information Security (Safeguards Rule)     

Service Providers / Vendor Management     

 [***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 
 
 Confidential Treatment Requested by Tesla Motors, Inc. 
   
    In accordance with the Fair Lending program and other regulatory compliance, it is the company s policy to:   

Maintain up to date regulatory policy statements,     

Perform and document periodic  training for all employees involved with any aspect of the lending transactions,     

Perform ongoing monitoring for compliance with regulatory policies, procedures and practices,     

Conduct a regular assessment of the marketing of leasing products, and     

Perform meaningful oversight of compliance by Senior Management.     

ii.   
 
 Applicant Notification Letters:    

 The credit department will issue an adverse action notice within 30 days of the decision on each application that is declined or conditionally approved. The LOS generates the adverse action letter which informs the applicant s rights under law including the right to obtain specific adverse action reasons by writing to us within 30 days. 
 In addition, all California applicants will receive the California Credit Score Disclosure Notice indicating the credit score, the source of that score, and information about where their score falls with respect to other consumers. 

iii.   
 
 Audit Policy:    

 The business activities of Tesla Finance are subject to periodic audits in accordance with Tesla Motors Audit Committee rules and risk assessment results. This review may cover all leases or include a sample over a predetermined period, current, past due and liquidated leases.  In addition, a sample of smaller leases may also be examined to ensure compliance and flag major departure from established policy and procedures. 

iv.   
 
 Records Retention:    

 The following documents will be held for a period not less than required by relevant statutes   in electronic format, where possible: 

Original credit application,   

Credit report obtained from a credit reporting agency,   

Copies of all legal notices sent to the applicant,

    3.    COLLECTIONS POLICY  
 A.  General Policy Statement 
 The performance of a lending portfolio is subject to individual, maturation, seasonal, economic, and collateral factors. The role of the collections function is to satisfactorily resolve the delinquency situation taking into account the customer s situation, TFL s risk exposure, and overall portfolio performance goals. At a high level the primary collections goals are to: 

Provide outstanding customer service in line with Tesla brand values and expectations,     

Minimize collection costs by identifying the most effective ways to allocate resources,      

Increase collections effectiveness by assessing the cost versus benefit at the lease level,      

Increase total recovered dollars by optimizing early to late stage collection activities while determining the ideal contact method and collection strategy, all at the lease level, and     

Determine the ideal repossession and recovery strategy     

 B.  Loss Mitigation Department Roles and Responsibilities 
 To successfully achieve each of the above goals, the Loss Mitigation department at TFL s servicer, [***], maintains timely, professional, compliant, and effective collection practices. The importance of immediate collection follow-up on a delinquent account cannot be over-emphasized. Account profitability is affected by more than the potential loss due to repossession. The use of a servicing partner is an important complement to the lease origination function. Employing the expertise of a well-established servicer relieves the company of the many details of this function and can effectively minimize losses, provide outstanding customer service, and reduce the costs of collection.   
 Daily collections efforts are performed by the servicer s Loss Mitigation Team and managed by the Customer Service and Operations Lead at Tesla. The Loss Mitigation Team is currently comprised of trained collection representatives, each of whom is trained in customer service, client interaction and collections. Leads or Supervisors oversee the daily actions of up to five representatives, with a manager for every two or three leads/supervisors. Each of these functional managers has been at the servicer for more than 10 years, and has worked with the Tesla Roadster lease program from inception. 
   Tesla s Customer Service and Operations Lead maintains frequent (often daily) interaction with the servicer s Loss Mitigation Manager and is kept abreast of lease level collection efforts through shared reporting and bi-monthly review. The CSO Lead remains the servicer s primary point of contact for escalations that require expedient  
 [***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 
 
 Confidential Treatment Requested by Tesla Motors, Inc. 
   
  treatment. While the CSO Lead acts as the servicer s primary escalation point, it is the CSO Lead s responsibility to report abnormal risk exposure to the President of TFL.   
 C.  Collections Treatment Strategy and Plan 
 The timing and intensity of collections activity is determined by the delinquency stage, risk exposure, and the customers  ability and willingness to fulfill the agreed upon course of action. A combination of relationship building, customer service, and assertive collection skills are critical in an effective collector. The collections process will generally escalate from customer service (how can we help?) towards a front-line collections (when can we expect payment?) approach as the customer s delinquency and risk of default increases.   
 All past due lease accounts are evaluated on their payment due date and assigned a specific collection strategy which includes payment notices, emails and telephone follow-up calls as part of the delinquency lifecycle activity stream. 

i.   
 
 Initial Delinquency/Customer Service Call:    

 Unless the situation requires it, [***] an account would be worked is [***]. At this point, Tesla s customer service team will perform courtesy calls to ensure billing related questions (the most common reason for early stage delinquency) are resolved.  

ii.   
 
 Formal Daily Collection Activity:    

 Once account becomes  delinquent  [***], Tesla will turn over formal collections activity to our servicer s Loss Mitigation Team. The team is composed of representatives assigned the responsibility of handling outbound and inbound calls. Representatives handling outbound calls review collection lists and place calls to delinquent accounts. Representatives should attempt to address customer delinquency on a one-call resolution basis.  
 The Work List sequences accounts for follow-up by the associate based upon the review date and payment due date. This list displays the first  available  account on the collection list and requires the associate to work the account before moving on to the next account requiring collection activity.

 Given the size, quality and expected performance of our portfolio, all delinquent accounts are [***] on [***].[***] customers will be handled differently than those [***] of the [***]. Customized data driven optimization strategies at the account level incorporating [***] will be deployed over time. Overall, the risk approach to collections is based on a matrix of risk/exposure levels and delinquency stage.  
   
 [***] 
   
 The low end of the risk spectrum is handled through [***] progressing to and culminating in [***] approach. 

iv.   
 
 Delinquency Lifecycle Activity:    

 The following sequence of activities will drive the collection efforts throughout the delinquency lifecycle.   
 [***] 
 [***] 
 [***]    
 [***]    
   
 A late fee of 5% of the contractual base monthly payment (or as limited by state laws) of any amount not received 10 days after the due date will be collected.  
 Collections Authority and Exceptions: 
 [***] Contact will be performed by Tesla s customer service and operations team.

   In unique situations where collections activity may deviate from the standard collections timeline, the CSO Lead may authorize collection notices to be mailed in advance or

The recovery strategy will aim to minimize loss, protect the asset/equipment, and maintain positive customer experience. 

v.   
 
 Customer Contact and Documentation Policy:        

 All forms of communication (telephone, general correspondence, email) between TFL, the servicer and customers should be performed in an appropriate professional manner. Representatives are not to demonstrate conduct that is annoying, illegal, or harassing. 
 Representatives must utilize effective and professional telephone skills when contacting customers. When speaking with the customer, representatives must identify themselves and state they are calling on behalf of Tesla Finance. 
 Representatives must not indicate they are calling on behalf of Tesla Finance when speaking to a party other than the debtor or when leaving voice messages.  
 Representatives should communicate in a clear, confident and polite manner and treat all customers fairly, courteously and equitably. Upon assuming control of the conversation, representatives should employ the following guidelines: 

Determine the customer's financial situation.     

Demonstrate understanding by allowing the customer the opportunity to propose solutions to the delinquency. Customers are more likely to follow through on their own proposals or promises rather than those suggested by the   representative.     

Explore viable short-term and long-term solutions to the delinquency.     

Offer the customer satisfactory payment arrangements to remit the full amount due, including late charges.*     

Obtain a specific and detailed payment commitment from the customer for bringing the account current  .     

Emphasize to the customer the importance of keeping the payment arrangements.     

Follow-up on promises or commitments to pay on agreed upon dates.     

Promote positive customer relations.     

 *Once payment arrangements are obtained, the loss mitigation representative should ensure the appropriate system entry notes and update tasks are accomplished.

vi.   
 
        T  elephone Collection Policy  :     

 TFL collection procedures emphasize the use of the telephone as the primary means for contacting delinquent customers. Telephone contact is timely and often provides for immediate results. When conducting telephone collections, it is policy to treat all delinquent customers in a fair manner and comply with all regulations. A delinquent customer is entitled to receive helpful assistance in a courteous manner. 
 Objectives: 
 The representative's main objectives in contacting the customer should be: 

Verify pertinent customer information such as current home address, home and/or business telephone number, and employment status.     

Obtain the reason(s) for delinquency.     

Obtain a firm commitment from the customer on payment arrangements for bringing the account   current and keeping the account current until account liquidation.     

 It is essential that the reason for delinquency is determined, notated on the system, and the account delinquency is resolved on the initial customer contact (once and done). 
 Basic Guidelines for Effective Customer Interaction: 
 Each customer has a reason(s) for delinquency; therefore, the representative must evaluate and work each account on an individual basis. The representative must maintain a positive and professional approach in resolving the delinquency situation of each account. The basic guidelines are as follows: 

Focus on Specifics - The representative must focus on the specifics of the delinquency situation. A customer may overreact to the most business like collection contact by raising his/her voice or by using profanity. Representatives should not take these actions personally and never reply in kind.     

Build and Maintain Self-Confidence and Self-Esteem   Representatives must emphasize the benefits of keeping the account in good standing, without engaging in any threats, implied or otherwise.     

Build and Maintain a Positive, Constructive Relationship   Representatives must advise the customer of their intention to help resolve the situation.     

 D.  Bankruptcy Handling 
   Filing of the bankruptcy petition requires (with limited exceptions) TFL to cease or "stay" further action to collect their claims. Once filed, the petition prohibits actions to accelerate, set-off, enforce a statutory, or otherwise collect the debt. The petition also  
 [***] Information has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential Treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.

  prohibits post-bankruptcy contacts with the   lessee   (i.e., "dunning" letters.) The stay remains in effect until the bankruptcy court releases the   lessee s   property from the estate, dismisses the bankruptcy case, and approves a creditor's request for termination of the stay or the   lessee   obtains or is denied a discharge.      
 E.  Repossession and Reinstatement 
 Unless [***], the repossession of a leased vehicle [***] action considered to resolve the situation. However, repo assignment should happen [***]. All repo assignments must be approved by the President of TFL. TFL will comply with all applicable state level laws regarding cure notices, reporting delinquency to bureaus, and right to reinstate. Repossessed vehicles may be sold at public auction to reduce TFL s exposure to loss. The President of TFL will decide how repossessed equipment is sold.  
 F.  Charge-off Policy 
 The general policy is to charge-off [***]. The following conditions should generally result in a charge-off: 
 [***]

 (2) To ensure that those reputable debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively dis-advantaged, and 
 (3) Promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses. 
 The FDCPA defines activities that are harassing, deceptive, or otherwise unacceptable. The representatives are not permitted to engage in any conduct that would mislead, harass, or abuse any person. Some examples of such conduct include: 

The use or threat of violence, or other criminal means to harm the customer, the customer's reputation, or the customer's property.     

Collecting any amount unless authorized by the contract or applicable law.

EXHIBIT 99.1 
   
 RISK FACTORS  
 Risks Related to the Merger  
 The Exchange Ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the stock prices of either Tesla or SolarCity.  
 Upon closing of the Merger, each share of SolarCity Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.110 shares of Tesla Common Stock with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. This Exchange Ratio is fixed in the Merger Agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either Tesla Common Stock or SolarCity Common Stock. Because the Exchange Ratio is fixed, changes in the price of Tesla Common Stock prior to the Merger will affect the value of the merger consideration that SolarCity stockholders will receive on the date of the Merger. In addition, Tesla will issue an amount of shares of Tesla Common Stock in the Merger based on the number of shares of SolarCity Common Stock outstanding as of the effective time of the Merger, and the amount of shares of Tesla Common Stock issued in the Merger will not change based on the price of the shares of Tesla Common Stock or SolarCity Common Stock as of the date of the Merger or their relative price, or any changes in their price or relative price prior to the Merger.  
 Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors (many of which are beyond our control), including the following:  

changes in our respective businesses, operations and prospects;     

changes in market assessments of the business, operations, and prospects of either company;     

investor behavior and strategies, including market assessments of the likelihood that the Merger will be completed;     

interest rates, general market and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the price of Tesla s and SolarCity s common stock; and     

federal, state, and local legislation, governmental regulation, and legal developments in the jurisdictions in which SolarCity and Tesla operate.     

 The price of Tesla Common Stock at the closing of the Merger may vary from its price on the date the Merger Agreement was executed, on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and/or on the dates of the special meetings of Tesla and SolarCity. As a result, the market value represented by the Exchange Ratio will also vary. For example, based on the range of closing prices of Tesla Common Stock during the period from June 21, 2016, the last full trading day before Tesla s public announcement of its intent to acquire SolarCity, through October 10, 2016, the latest practicable date before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the Exchange Ratio represented a market value ranging from a low of $21.96 to a high of $22.46 for each share of SolarCity Common Stock.  
 The ability of Tesla and SolarCity to complete the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the absence of antitrust challenges from governmental entities, which may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on Tesla or SolarCity or could delay or cause us to abandon the Merger.  
 Notification and Report Forms required by the HSR Act were filed with the DOJ and the FTC on August 15, 2016. The FTC granted early termination of the applicable HSR Act waiting period to the parties on August 24, 2016. The DOJ, the FTC and others, however, may still challenge the Merger on antitrust grounds at any time before or after the completion of the Merger, any of the DOJ, the FTC or another person could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including without limitation seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger, conditionally approve the Merger upon the divestiture of assets of Tesla or SolarCity, subject the consummation of the Merger to regulatory conditions or seek other remedies. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, it will not succeed. The Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms, and the Merger may not be completed.  

Completion of the Merger is subject to a number of other conditions that must be fulfilled, including, among others, the conditions that (i) the Tesla Merger and Share Issuance Proposal be approved by (a) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority o  f the total votes of shares of Tesla Common Stock cast in person or by proxy at the special meeting to approve the Tesla Share Issuance pursuant to the NASDAQ Market Rules and (b) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Tesla Com  mon Stock cast in person or by proxy at the Tesla Special Meeting that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the Excluded Tesla Parties, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement; (ii) the SolarCity Merger Proposal be approved by (a) the affirmativ  e vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SolarCity Common Stock entitled to vote in person or by proxy at the special meeting pursuant to Delaware law and (b) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of SolarC  ity Common Stock cast in person or by proxy at the SolarCity Special Meeting that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the Excluded SolarCity Parties, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement; (iii) the absence of certain continuing defaults or m  andatory prepayment events under SolarCity s indebtedness; and (iv) SolarCity having a specified level of accounts payable. These conditions may not be fulfilled, and if this occurs, the Merger may not be completed. In addition, if the Merger is not comple  ted by April 30, 2017, either Tesla or SolarCity may choose not to proceed with the Merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the Merger, before or after stockholder approval. In   addition, Tesla or SolarCity may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances. See    The Merger Agreement Conditions to the Completion of the Merger    beginning on page 129 and    The Merger Agreement Termination of the Merger Agreeme  nt    on beginning on page 131 for a fuller description of these circumstances.   
 Any delay in completing the Merger may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from the transaction.  
 The Merger is subject to a number of conditions beyond Tesla s and SolarCity s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. Tesla and SolarCity cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. There can be no assurance that either Tesla or SolarCity or both parties will waive any condition to closing that is not satisfied. Furthermore, the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals and the time required to satisfy any other conditions to the closing could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause Tesla not to realize some or all of the benefits that it expects to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe. See the section entitled   The Merger Agreement Conditions to the Completion of the Merger   beginning on page 129.  
   
 Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business and financial results of Tesla and SolarCity.  
 If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Tesla or SolarCity may be adversely affected and Tesla and SolarCity will be subject to several risks, including the following:  

being required, under certain circumstances, to pay a termination fee of $78.2 million, in the case of a payment by Tesla to SolarCity, and $78.2 million or $26.1 million, in the case of a payment by SolarCity to Tesla (see    The Merger Agreement Expenses and Termination Fees    beginning on page 132);     

having to pay certain costs relating to the proposed Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees;     

under the Merger Agreement, each of Tesla and SolarCity being subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain business strategies; and     

the focus of management of each of the companies on the Merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that may be beneficial to each company.     

If the Merger does not occur, Tesl  a and SolarCity may incur these costs without realizing any of the benefits of the Merger being completed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, Tesla and/or SolarCity may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from their respe  ctive customers and employees. Tesla and/or SolarCity could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against Tesla or SolarCity to perform their respective obligations under the Mer  ger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, Tesla and SolarCity cannot assure their respective stockholders that these risks will not materialize or will not materially affect the business, financial results and stock prices of SolarCity or Tesla.   
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquiror or could result in any competing proposal being offered at a lower price than it might otherwise be.  
 The Merger Agreement contains  no shop  provisions that, after the expiration of the  go-shop  period, which concluded on September 14, 2016, with no parties qualifying as Excluded Parties, subject to limited exceptions, restrict SolarCity s ability to solicit, encourage, facilitate or discuss competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of SolarCity. Further, even if the SolarCity Board withdraws or modifies its recommendation of the SolarCity Merger Proposal, it will still be required to submit the matter to a vote of the SolarCity stockholders at the SolarCity Special Meeting unless the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. In addition, Tesla generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the Merger and the Merger Agreement in response to any competing Acquisition Proposals that may be made before the SolarCity Board may withdraw or modify its recommendation. In some circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, one of the parties may be required to pay a termination fee to the other party. Tesla is subject to similar  no shop provisions  with respect to competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of Tesla. For additional information, see the sections entitled   The Merger Agreement SolarCity Go-Shop   beginning on page 126,    No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals   beginning on page 126,    Termination Rights in Response to a Superior Proposal; Changes in Board Recommendations   beginning on page 128 and    Termination of the Merger Agreement   beginning on page 131.  
 These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquiror from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than that market value proposed to be received or realized in the Merger, or might result in a potential competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.  
   
 Tesla s Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that a state court within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between Tesla and its stockholders, which could limit stockholders  ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Tesla or its current or former directors, officers or employees.  
 Tesla s Amended and Restated Bylaws (  Tesla s Bylaws  ) provide that unless Tesla consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Tesla, any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of Tesla to Tesla or its stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or Tesla s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (  Tesla s Charter  ) or Tesla s Bylaws, any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or any action asserting an  internal corporate claim  as that term is defined by Section 115 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the   DGCL  ). The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with Tesla or its current or former directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against Tesla and its current or former directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in Tesla s Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, Tesla may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm its business, results of operations, and financial condition.  

SolarCity s Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended to d  ate, provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between SolarCity and its stockholders, which could limit stockholders  ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for di  sputes with SolarCity or its current or former directors, officers or employees.   
 SolarCity s Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended to date (  SolarCity s Bylaws  ), provide that unless SolarCity consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the   Delaware Court of Chancery  ) (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, any state or federal court located within the State of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of SolarCity, any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or agent of SolarCity to SolarCity or its stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or SolarCity s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (  SolarCity s Charter  ) or SolarCity s Bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. SolarCity s Bylaws further provide that any acquiror of SolarCity s capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to (i) this provision, (ii) the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or any state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, as applicable), and (iii) having service of process made upon such stockholder. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with SolarCity or its current or former directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against SolarCity and its current or former directors, officers, employees or agents. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in SolarCity s Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, SolarCity may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm its business, results of operations, and financial condition.  
 The Merger will involve substantial costs.  
 Tesla and SolarCity have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expenses relating directly to the Merger and the Tesla Share Issuance, including debt refinancing costs, fees and expenses payable to financial advisors, other professional fees and expenses, insurance premium costs, fees and costs relating to regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing costs and other transaction-related costs, fees and expenses. If the Merger is not completed, Tesla and SolarCity will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received by either company.  
   
 The pendency of the Merger and related uncertainty could adversely affect the relationships of Tesla and SolarCity with employees, customers, commercial partners, financing parties and other third parties.  
 Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, customers, commercial partners and other third parties may have an adverse effect on SolarCity and Tesla. These uncertainties may cause customers, suppliers commercial partners, financing parties and others that deal with SolarCity or Tesla to seek to change, delay or defer decisions with respect to existing or future business relationships. Retention, hiring and motivation of certain current and prospective employees by SolarCity or Tesla may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as they may experience uncertainty about their future roles with SolarCity or Tesla. If key employees, customers, commercial partners, financing parties and other third parties terminate or change, or seek to terminate or change, their existing relationships with SolarCity or Tesla, SolarCity s business or Tesla s business, and the Combined Company s business as a result, could be harmed.  
 The consummation of the Merger may permit counterparties to other agreements to terminate those agreements.  
 SolarCity is party to certain agreements that give the counterparties to such agreements, including investors and commercial partners, certain rights, including notice, consent and other rights in connection with  change of control  transactions or otherwise, that may give rise to a default by SolarCity under the agreements or a right by the counterparty to terminate the agreement. Under certain of these agreements, the Merger may constitute a  change of control  or otherwise give rise to consent or termination rights and, therefore, the counterparties may assert their rights in connection with the Merger and claim a default of the agreement by SolarCity and/or terminate the agreements, which may adversely affect business and operations of Tesla and the value of Tesla s common stock following the Merger.  

The fairness opinions obtained by the Tesla Board and the SolarCity Special Committee from their respective financial advisors will not be updated to reflect changes in circumstances between signing the Merg  er Agreement and the completion of the Merger.   
 Neither the Tesla Board nor the SolarCity Special Committee has obtained an updated fairness opinion as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus from Evercore, Tesla s financial advisor, or Lazard, the SolarCity Special Committee s financial advisor. Changes in the operations and prospects of Tesla or SolarCity, general market and economic conditions, and other factors that may be beyond the control of Tesla and SolarCity and on which the fairness opinions were based, may alter the value of Tesla or SolarCity or the price of shares of Tesla or SolarCity Common Stock by the time the Merger is completed.  
 The fairness opinions do not speak as of the time the Merger will be completed or as of any date other than the dates of such opinions. Neither Tesla nor SolarCity anticipates asking their respective financial advisors to update their fairness opinions. The fairness opinions of Evercore and Lazard are included as  Annexes C    and    D , respectively, to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the fairness opinions that the Tesla Board received from its financial advisor and a summary of the material financial analyses it provided to the Tesla Board in connection with rendering such opinions, see the section entitled   The Merger Opinion of Tesla s Financial Advisor   beginning on page 74. For a description of the opinion that the SolarCity Special Committee received from its financial advisor and a summary of the material financial analyses such financial advisor provided to the SolarCity Special Committee in connection with rendering such opinion, see the section entitled   The Merger Opinion of the Financial Advisor to the SolarCity Special Committee   beginning on page 88.  
 For a description of the factors considered by the Tesla Board in determining to approve the Merger and the Tesla Share Issuance, see the section entitled   The Merger Tesla s Reasons for the Merger and Tesla Share Issuance; Recommendation of the Tesla Board of Directors   beginning on page 70. For a description of the factors considered by the SolarCity Board in determining to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger, see the section entitled   The Merger SolarCity s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the SolarCity Special Committee and Board of Directors   beginning on page 83.  
   
 Certain directors and executive officers of Tesla and SolarCity have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Tesla s stockholders and SolarCity s stockholders generally.  
 Certain executive officers of Tesla and SolarCity participated in the negotiation of the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Tesla Board, with two directors recusing themselves, approved the Merger Agreement and the Tesla Share Issuance and determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and the Tesla Share Issuance, are advisable and in the best interests of Tesla and its stockholders. The Special Committee and the SolarCity Board, upon the recommendation of the Special Committee approved the Merger Agreement and determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of SolarCity and its stockholders. In considering these facts and the other information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should be aware that certain of Tesla s directors and executive officers and certain of SolarCity s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Tesla s or SolarCity s stockholders. For example, some Tesla directors and executive officers own shares in SolarCity and serve on the SolarCity Board, and some SolarCity directors own shares of Tesla and serve on the Tesla Board. See the sections entitled   Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management/Directors of Tesla   beginning on page 172 and   The Merger Interests of Tesla s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger   beginning on page 106 and   Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management/Directors of SolarCity   beginning on page 175 and   The Merger Interests of SolarCity s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger   beginning on page 108.  

SolarCity stockholders will not be entitled to dissenters  or appraisal rights in the Merger.   
 Dissenters  or appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders of a corporation to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a Merger, and to demand that such corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the DGCL, stockholders do not have appraisal rights if the shares of stock they hold, at the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders to act upon the Merger or consolidation, are either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appraisal rights are available if stockholders are required by the terms of the Merger Agreement to accept for their shares anything other than (a) shares of stock of the surviving corporation, (b) shares of stock of another corporation that will either be listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (c) cash instead of fractional shares or (d) any combination of clauses (a)-(c).  
 Because SolarCity Common Stock is listed on NASDAQ, a national securities exchange, and is expected to continue to be so listed on the record date, and because the Merger otherwise satisfies the foregoing requirements, holders of SolarCity Common Stock will not be entitled to dissenters  or appraisal rights in the Merger with respect to their shares of SolarCity Common Stock.  
 Pending litigation against Tesla could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the Merger or a judgment resulting in the payment of damages.  
 Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging the Merger. These lawsuits are captioned as  City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund  v.  Elon Musk, et al. , C.A, No. 12711-VCS;  Ellen Prasinos  v.  Elon Musk, et al. , C.A. No. 12723-VCS;  Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, et al.  v.  Elon Musk, et al. , C.A. No. 12740-VCS; and  P. Evan Stephens  v.  Elon Musk, et al. , C.A. No. 1275-VCS;  Pyare Diwana  v.  Elon Musk, et al.,  C.A. No. 12796-VCS;  Nguyen  v . Elon Musk, et al.,  C.A. No. 12808-VCS; and  Wolf  v.  Elon Musk, et al.,  C.A. No. 12805-VCS (collectively, the   Actions  ), naming as defendants the Tesla Board, and certain of the Actions also name as defendants Merger Sub, SolarCity, and certain members of the SolarCity Board, Evercore, and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Other potential plaintiffs may also file additional lawsuits challenging the proposed Merger. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain.  
 If any Action is not resolved, the lawsuit(s) could prevent or delay completion of the Merger and result in substantial costs to Tesla and SolarCity, including any costs associated with the indemnification of its respective directors and officers. One condition to closing the Merger is the absence of any law, order, judgment or other legal restraint by a court or other governmental entity that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the closing of the Merger. If any lawsuit is filed challenging the Merger and is successful in obtaining an injunction preventing the parties to the Merger Agreement from consummating the Merger, such injunction may delay or prevent the Merger. As such, if plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe. Additionally, if the Merger is completed, Tesla would assume the risks and liabilities associated with litigation that SolarCity and certain members of the SolarCity Board are party to, and Tesla has agreed to indemnify the directors and officers of SolarCity following the completion of the Merger for liability arising out of the fact that each such person was a director or officer of SolarCity prior to the date of the Merger Agreement.  
 The defense or settlement of these Actions and any future additional litigation could be time-consuming and expensive, divert the attention of Tesla management and/or SolarCity management away from their regular business, and, if any one of these Actions or any future litigation is adversely resolved against either Tesla or SolarCity, could have a material adverse effect on their respective financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of Tesla or the Combined Company if resolved after the Merger is completed. For more information, see   The Merger Litigation Relating to the Merger .   

Until the completion of the Merger or the termination of the Merg  er Agreement in accordance with its terms, in consideration of the agreements made by the parties in the Merger Agreement, Tesla and SolarCity are each prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be be  neficial to Tesla or SolarCity and their respective stockholders.   
 Until the Merger is completed, the Merger Agreement restricts each of Tesla and SolarCity from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party, and requires each of Tesla and SolarCity to operate in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices. SolarCity is subject to a number of customary interim operating covenants relating to, among other things, its capital expenditures, incurrence of indebtedness, entry into or amendment of certain types of agreements, equity grants and changes in employee compensation. These restrictions may prevent Tesla and/or SolarCity from making appropriate changes to their respective businesses or pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. See   The Merger Agreement Conduct of Business   beginning on page 122 for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to Tesla and SolarCity, respectively.  
 Risks Related to the Business of the Combined Company Following the Merger  
 Tesla is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Tesla and SolarCity.  
 Tesla is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the business, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems of SolarCity with those of Tesla. There are a large number of systems that must be integrated, including management information, purchasing, administrative, accounting and finance, sales, marketing, billing, payroll and benefits, installation, engineering, infrastructure and regulatory compliance, among others. While Tesla has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. These integration expenses likely will result in Tesla taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the Merger, but the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present, and if such charges are greater than expected, they could offset the cost synergies that Tesla expects to achieve from the Merger.  
   
 Following the Merger, the Combined Company may be unable to integrate successfully the businesses of Tesla and SolarCity and realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.  
 The Merger involves the combination of two companies which currently operate as independent public companies. Following the Merger, the Combined Company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations. The Combined Company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. Potential difficulties the Combined Company may encounter in the integration process include the following:  

the inability to successfully combine the businesses of Tesla and SolarCity in a manner that permits the Combined Company to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the Merger, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Merger not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;     

lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either of the two companies deciding not to do business with the Combined Company;     

complexities associated with managing the combined businesses;     

integrating personnel from the two companies;     

creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;     

potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Merger; and     

performance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management s attention caused by completing the Merger and integrating the companies  operations.     

In addition, Tesla and   SolarCity have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the diversion of each company s management s attention, the disruption or interruption of,   or the loss of momentum in, each company s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or our abil  ity to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger, or could reduce the earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the Combined Company.   
 Activities undertaken during the pendency of the Merger to complete the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement may divert management attention and resources.  
 If the efforts and actions required of Tesla and SolarCity in order to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, such efforts and actions could result in the diversion of each company s management s attention and resources or the disruption or interruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company s ongoing businesses, which could adversely affect the business and financial results of Tesla or SolarCity, as applicable.  
 In connection with the Merger and the continuing operations of the Combined Company following the Merger, Tesla may refinance a significant amount of indebtedness and otherwise require additional financing; it cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain the necessary funds on favorable terms or at all.  
 Tesla may elect to refinance certain of SolarCity s indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, Tesla may need or want to raise additional funds for the operations of the Combined Company following the Merger. Tesla and SolarCity have been and may continue to be engaged in discussions with certain potential financing sources, including with respect to one or more credit facilities to be entered into by Tesla or SolarCity at the time of the closing of the Merger, funds from which would be used in part to make any such refinancing and to provide a source of additional funds and liquidity for the operations of the Combined Company following the Merger. However, the ability of the Combined Company to obtain such financing will depend on, among other factors, prevailing market conditions at the time of the closing of the Merger and other factors beyond the control of the Combined Company. There is no assurance that the Combined Company will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to the Combined Company, or at all.  
 In connection with the Merger, Tesla or one of its subsidiaries will be subject to significant additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect Tesla, including by decreasing Tesla s business flexibility and increasing Tesla s interest expense.  
 As of June 30, 2016, Tesla s consolidated indebtedness was approximately $3.7 billion, and SolarCity s consolidated indebtedness was approximately $3.3 billion. If the Merger is completed, Tesla expects that certain entities forming part of the Combined Company will be subject to most of the consolidated indebtedness of SolarCity, and the Combined Company may have to incur additional indebtedness in connection with any extinguishment of certain of such debt in connection with the closing of the Merger, as well as for its ongoing business needs. As a result, it is expected that the Combined Company will be subject to substantially increased indebtedness in comparison to Tesla s indebtedness on a recent historical basis. This increased indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Tesla s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing Tesla s interest expense. In addition, the amount of cash required to pay interest on the Combined Company s indebtedness following completion of the Merger, and thus the demands on the Combined Company s cash resources, will be greater than the amount of cash required to service the indebtedness of Tesla prior to the transaction. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the Merger could therefore reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.  

Tesla s and SolarCity s operations require substantial ongoing capital, and if financing is not availabl  e to the Combined Company on acceptable terms, if and when needed, its operations, growth and prospects could be negatively affected.   
 Tesla s and SolarCity s respective businesses are capital intensive. Following the Merger, the Combined Company is expected to incur significant costs on an ongoing basis to continue its operations, develop and manufacture its current or future products, and to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments. For example, the Combined Company may need or seek to raise capital from third-party fund investors and lenders to help finance the deployment of SolarCity s existing residential and commercial solar energy systems. If it is unable to do so when needed, or on desirable terms, to enable our customers  access to our solar energy systems with little or no upfront cost, it may be unable to finance installation of our customers  systems, or its cost of capital could increase and its liquidity may be constrained, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.  
 Tesla may also need or want to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes in connection with the Merger. Tesla s ability to raise capital from third-party fund investors and lenders to fund its operations and growth, or to refinance its existing indebtedness, will depend on, among other factors, Tesla s financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Tesla s control, such as any decisions by credit ratings agencies with respect to credit ratings that they may maintain with respect to Tesla. Any concerns regarding Tesla s business and liquidity, uncertainty regarding the timing and completion of the Merger and the capital structure of SolarCity and Tesla following the Merger and general market conditions could negatively impact Tesla s ability to access the capital markets or to raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all.  
   
 Current Tesla and SolarCity stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the Combined Company after the Merger and will exercise less influence over the Combined Company s management.  
 Current Tesla stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Tesla Board and other matters affecting Tesla. Current SolarCity stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the SolarCity Board and on other matters affecting SolarCity. Immediately after the Merger is completed, it is expected that current Tesla stockholders will own approximately 93.1% of the Tesla Common Stock and current SolarCity stockholders will own approximately 6.9% of the outstanding shares of Tesla Common Stock after the completion of the Merger, based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding of Tesla and SolarCity as of September 23, 2016, the record date for the special meetings.  
 As a result of the Merger, current Tesla and SolarCity stockholders will have less influence on the Combined Company s management and policies than they now have on the management and policies of Tesla and SolarCity, respectively.  

Future equity issuances could result in dilution of the Tesla Com  mon Stock, which could cause the price of Tesla Common Stock to decline, and future sales of Tesla Common Stock could depress the market price of Tesla Common Stock.   
 Tesla may from time to time in the future issue additional shares of common stock, including to finance the business of the Combined Company following the Merger. Such future issuances may be at prices that are below the prevailing or historical market price of Tesla Common Stock. Actual or anticipated issuances or sales of substantial amounts of common stock could cause the market price of Tesla Common Stock to decline and make it more difficult for Tesla to sell equity securities in the future at a time and on terms that Tesla deems appropriate. The issuance of any shares of Tesla Common Stock in the future (including after the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the date of the Tesla or SolarCity Special Meetings and prior to the completion of the Merger) also would dilute the percentage ownership interest held by stockholders prior to such issuance and would reduce the percentage ownership that SolarCity stockholders would have owned in Tesla upon completion of the Merger, and any such dilution may reduce the value of the consideration that SolarCity stockholders will receive in the Merger. Further, Tesla s ability to complete any future capital raise, including any offering of shares of Tesla Common Stock, on commercially reasonable terms is dependent on market conditions and factors which may be beyond Tesla s control, including actual or anticipated fluctuations in Tesla s operating results, changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or Tesla s ability to meet those estimates, the operating performance and stock price of comparable companies, changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which Tesla operates, and domestic and worldwide economic conditions.  
 The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data for Tesla included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is preliminary, and Tesla s actual financial position and operations after the Merger may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma financial data included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.  
 The unaudited pro forma financial data for Tesla included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what Tesla s actual financial position or operations would have been had the Merger been completed within the expected time frame. Tesla s actual results and financial position after the Merger may differ materially and adversely from the unaudited pro forma financial data included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to record the SolarCity identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill. The purchase price allocation reflected in this document is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of SolarCity as of the date of the completion of the Merger. Further, the Combined Company expects to recognize a significant amount of additional goodwill in the Merger. The goodwill will be subject to annual impairment assessments and a material charge may be necessary if the results of operations and cash flows are unable to support the goodwill subsequent to the Merger. For more information see the section entitled   Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information   beginning on page 141.  

The prospective financial forecasts for SolarCity included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus reflect SolarCity management estimates and SolarCity s actual performance may differ materially from the prospective financial forecasts included in th  is joint proxy statement/prospectus.   
 The prospective financial forecasts for SolarCity included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are based on assumptions of, and information available to, SolarCity at the time such prospective financial forecasts were prepared. SolarCity does not know whether the assumptions made will prove correct. Any or all of such information may turn out to be wrong. Such information can be adversely affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond SolarCity s control. Further, prospective financial forecasts of this type are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to factors such as company performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions, as well as changes to the business, financial condition or results of operations of SolarCity, including the factors described under   Other Risk Factors of Tesla and SolarCity   beginning on page 48 and   Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   beginning on page 34, which factors and changes may cause the prospective financial forecasts or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result of these contingencies, there can be no assurance that the prospective financial forecasts of SolarCity will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. In view of these uncertainties, the inclusion of the prospective financial forecasts of SolarCity in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that the Tesla Board, the SolarCity Board, Tesla, SolarCity, Merger Sub, Evercore, Lazard or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results.  
 The prospective financial forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance with U.S. GAAP, published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information.  
 In addition, the prospective financial forecasts have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date the prospective financial forecasts were prepared or as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For more information see the section entitled   The Merger Certain Tesla and SolarCity Unaudited Prospective Financial Information   beginning on page 99.  
 The Combined Company s future results will suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the Merger.  
 Following the Merger, the size and scope of operations of the business of the Combined Company will increase beyond the current size and scope of operations of either Tesla s or SolarCity s current businesses. In addition, Tesla may continue to expand its size and operations through additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Tesla s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage its expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the Tesla will be successful or that it will realize the expected economies of scale, synergies and other benefits currently anticipated from the Merger or anticipated from any additional acquisitions or strategic transactions.  
 The trading price of Tesla Common Stock is likely to continue to be volatile.  
 The trading price of Tesla Common Stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond Tesla s control. Tesla s Common Stock has experienced an intra-day trading high of $271.57 per share and a low of $141.05 per share over the last 52 weeks. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies  stock, including Tesla s, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. For example, a stockholder litigation like this was filed against Tesla in 2013. While the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs  complaint with prejudice, this litigation (if the trial court s order is successfully appealed) or others like it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of the attention and resources of Tesla s management.  

The shares of Tesla Common Stock to be received by SolarCity stockholders as a result of the Merger will have different rights from the shares of SolarCity Common Stock currently he  ld by SolarCity stockholders.   
 Upon completion of the Merger, SolarCity stockholders will become Tesla stockholders and their rights as stockholders will be governed by Tesla s Charter and Tesla s Bylaws. The rights associated with Tesla Common Stock are different from the rights associated with SolarCity Common Stock. See the section entitled   Comparison of the Rights of Holders of Tesla Common Stock and Holders of SolarCity Common Stock   beginning on page 156 for a discussion of the different rights associated with Tesla Common Stock.  
 The market price of Tesla s common stock may decline in the future as a result of the Merger.  
 The market price of Tesla Common Stock may decline in the future as a result of the Merger for a number of reasons, including if the integration of Tesla and SolarCity is unsuccessful (including for the reasons set forth in the preceding risk factor) or if Tesla fails to achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts. These factors are, to some extent, beyond the control of Tesla.  
 The Merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution to Tesla s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Tesla Common Stock.  
 Tesla currently anticipates that the Merger will be accretive to earnings per share in 2016, assuming refinancing of SolarCity s outstanding debt at or around the closing of the Merger and excluding one-time costs. This expectation, however, is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change, including the currently expected timing of the Merger. Tesla could also encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors such as a delay in the closing of the Merger and/or the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Merger. All of these factors could cause dilution to Tesla s earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger and cause a decrease in the market price of Tesla Common Stock.
