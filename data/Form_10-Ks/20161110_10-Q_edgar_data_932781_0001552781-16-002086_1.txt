1 - Basis of Presentation     

In the opinion
of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets, and the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in shareholders  equity, and the cash flows of First Community Corporation (the  Company ),
present fairly in all material respects the Company s financial position at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and
the Company s results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

In the opinion
of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly present the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations
have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are presented in accordance with
the instructions for Form 10-Q. The information included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be referred
to in connection with these unaudited interim financial statements.     

Note
2   Earnings Per Common Share    

The following
reconciles the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per common share computation:  

(In thousands
except average market price)   

In the fourth
quarter of 2011, we issued $2.5 million in 8.75% subordinated notes maturing December 16, 2019. On November 15, 2012, the subordinated
notes were redeemed in full at par. Warrants for 107,500 shares of common stock at $5.90 per share were issued in connection with
the issuance of the subordinated notes. At September 30, 2016 there were 97,180 warrants outstanding. These warrants expire on
December 16, 2019 and are included in dilutive securities in the table above.  

The Company
has issued a total of 138,000 restricted shares to its employees and non-employee directors under the terms of its compensation
plans and employment agreements. The employee shares cliff vest over a three-year period, and the non-employee director shares
vest one year after issuance. The unrecognized compensation cost at September 30, 2016 for non-vested shares amounts to $313 thousand.  

In 2006,
the Company established a Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan, whereby a director may elect to defer all or any part
of their annual retainer and monthly meeting fees payable with respect to service on the board of directors or a committee of
the board. Units of common stock are credited to the director s account at the time compensation is earned and are included
in dilutive securities in the table above. At September 30, 2016 there were 99,638 units issued under the Plan. The accrued liability
at September 30, 2016 amounted to $936.7 thousand and is included in  Other liabilities  on the balance sheet.  

Note
3 Investment Securities    

The amortized
cost and estimated fair values of investment securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized below:  

   AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE:   

HELD-TO-MATURITY:   

During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company received proceeds of $33.2 million and $17.1 million, respectively,
from the sale of investment securities available-for-sale.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, gross realized
gains totaled $601 thousand and there were no gross realized losses.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, gross
realized gains totaled $271 thousand and there were no gross realized losses.  During the three months ended September 30,
2016, the Company received proceeds of $19.1 million from the sale of investment securities available-for-sale, gross realized
gains totaled $478 thousand and there were no gross realized losses.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, there
were no sales of investment securities.  

At September
30, 2016, corporate and other securities available-for-sale included the following at fair value: mutual funds at $818.1 thousand,
foreign debt of $60.3 thousand, and corporate preferred stock in the amount of $950.0 thousand. At December 31, 2015, corporate
and other securities available-for-sale included the following at fair value: mutual funds at $839.2 thousand, foreign debt
of $60.3 thousand, and corporate preferred stock in the amount of $416.8 thousand.  

Other investments,
at cost, include Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) stock in the amount of $1.7 million and $1.8 million at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Note
3 Investment Securities    

The following
tables show gross unrealized losses and fair values, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities
have been in a continuous loss position, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. There were no held-to-maturity securities
with gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2016.  

Note
3 Investment Securities - continued     

Government
Sponsored Enterprise, Mortgage-Backed Securities:  The Company owned mortgage-backed securities ( MBSs ), including
collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), issued by government sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) with
an amortized cost of $152.6 million and $146.9 million and approximate fair value of $153.8 million and $146.3 million at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of the MBSs issued by GSEs
were classified as  Available for Sale.  Unrealized losses on certain of these investments are not considered to be
 other than temporary,  and we have the intent and ability to hold these until they mature or recover the current
book value. The contractual cash flows of the investments are guaranteed by the GSE. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities
would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the Company s investment. Because the Company does not intend
to sell these securities and it is more likely than not the Company will not be required sell these securities before a recovery
of its amortized cost, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider the investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired
at September 30, 2016.  

   Non-agency
Mortgage-Backed Securities:  The Company held private label mortgage-backed securities ( PLMBSs ), including CMOs,
at September 30, 2016 with an amortized cost of $445.4 thousand and approximate fair value of $441.3 thousand. The Company held
PLMBSs, including CMOs, at December 31, 2015 with an amortized cost of $554.8 thousand and approximate fair value of $556.3 thousand.  

State
and Local Governments and Other:  Management monitors these securities to identify any deterioration in the credit quality.
Included in the monitoring is a review of the credit rating, a financial analysis and certain demographic data on the underlying
issuer. The Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.  

The following
sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities at September 30, 2016 by contractual maturity. Expected
maturities differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay the obligations with or without
prepayment penalties. MBSs are based on average life at estimated prepayment speeds.  

Note
4 Loans    

Loans
summarized by category as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015 are as follows:  

Note

The detailed
activity in the allowance for loan losses and the recorded investment in loans receivable as of and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:

Loans
outstanding to bank directors, executive officers and their related business interests amounted to $8.3 million and $6.9 million
at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. Repayments on these loans during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 were $716 thousand and loans made totaled $139 thousand. Repayments on these loans during the nine months ended September
30, 2015 were $1.3 million and loans made totaled $4.1 million. Related party loans are made on substantially the same terms,
including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons and
generally do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability.   

Note
4 Loans-continued    

The
detailed activity in the allowance for loan losses as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months
ended September 30, 2015 is as follows:  

The following
table presents at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 loans individually evaluated and considered impaired under Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 310  Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.  Impairment includes performing troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).  

Note
4 Loans-continued    

The following
tables are by loan category and present at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 loans individually
evaluated and considered impaired under FASB ASC 310  Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.  Impairment
includes performing TDRs.

Note

The Company
categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, including:
current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends,
among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed
on a monthly basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:  

Special
Mention . Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If
left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s
credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient
risk to warrant adverse classification.  

Substandard .
Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the
collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of
the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are
not corrected.  

Doubtful .
Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic
that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values,
highly questionable and improbable.  

Loans not
meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered as pass rated
loans. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans
by class of loans is shown in the table below. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no loans were classified as doubtful.  

Note
4 Loans-continued    

At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, non-accrual loans totaled $3.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively.  

TDRs that
are still accruing and included in impaired loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to $1.8 million and
$1.6 million, respectively. TDRs in non-accrual status at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to $1.3 million and
$1.8 million, respectively.  

Loans greater
than 90 days delinquent and still accruing interest were $98.7 thousand as of September 30, 2016. There were no loans greater
than 90 days delinquent and still accruing interest as of December 31, 2015.  

Note 4 Loans-continued    

We account
for acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations , which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting.
All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses related to the acquired
loans is recorded on the acquisition date because the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit
risk.  

Acquired
credit-impaired loans are accounted for under the accounting guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated
credit quality, found in FASB ASC Topic 310-30,  Receivables Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit
Quality,  and initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over
the life of the loans. Loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of credit deterioration are considered impaired.
Loans acquired through business combinations that do not meet the specific criteria of FASB ASC Topic 310-30, but for which a
discount is attributable, at least in part to credit quality, are also accounted for under this guidance. Certain acquired loans,
including performing loans and revolving lines of credit (consumer and commercial), are accounted for in accordance with FASB
ASC Topic 310-20, where the discount is accreted through earnings based on estimated cash flows over the estimated life of the
loan.  

Purchase
credit impaired ( PCI ) loans acquired totaled $4.2 million at estimated fair value, and acquired performing loans
totaling $102.3 million at estimated fair value were not credit impaired. The gross contractual amount receivable for PCI loans
and acquired performing loans was approximately $5.7 million and $116.0 million, respectively, as of the acquisition date. For
the acquired performing loans, the best estimate at acquisition date of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected is
$825 thousand. Determining the fair value of PCI loans at acquisition required the Company to estimate cash flows expected to
result from those loans and to discount those cash flows at appropriate rates of interest. For such loans, the excess of cash
flows expected to be collected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is recognized as interest income over the remaining
lives of the loans and is called the accretable yield. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and
the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition reflects the impact of estimated credit losses and is called the nonaccretable
difference. In accordance with GAAP, there was no carry-over of previously established allowance for credit losses from the acquired
company.  

In
conjunction with the acquisition of Savannah River Financial Corporation of Augusta, Georgia, the bank holding company for
Savannah River Banking Company ( Savannah River ), on February 1, 2014, the acquired PCI loan portfolio was
accounted for at fair value as follows:

A summary
of changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows (in thousands):

  The
following tables are by loan category and present loans past due and on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015:  

Note
4 Loans-continued    

  The Company
reviews TDRs in accordance with applicable regulatory and accounting guidance.  

There were
no loans determined to be TDRs that were restructured during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 or the
three month period ended September 30, 2016.  

The following
table, by loan category, presents one loan determined to be a TDR during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The loan
was modified to extend the term of the loan due to financial hardship of the borrower. The loan was subsequently paid off in June
2016.  

During the
three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no loans determined to be TDRs in the previous twelve
months that had payment defaults. Defaulted loans are those loans that are greater than 89 days past due.  

In the determination
of the allowance for loan losses, all TDRs are reviewed to ensure that one of the three proper valuation methods (fair market
value of the collateral, present value of cash flows, or observable market price) is adhered to. All non-accrual loans are written
down to their corresponding collateral value. All troubled TDR accruing loans that have a loan balance that exceeds the present
value of cash flows will have a specific allocation. All nonaccrual loans are considered impaired. Under ASC 310-10, a loan is
impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due including both principal and interest
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  

Note
5 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

In
May 2014, the FASB issued guidance to change the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the
new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount
equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance will be effective for the Company for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will apply the guidance using a modified retrospective approach. The Company
does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In
January 2015, the FASB issued guidance to eliminate from U.S. GAAP the concept of an extraordinary item, which is an event or
transaction that is both (1) unusual in nature and (2) infrequently occurring. Under the new guidance, an entity will no longer
(1) segregate an extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations; (2) separately present an extraordinary item on its
income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; or (3) disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data
applicable to an extraordinary item. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning
of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In

analysis required under U.S. GAAP. Although the amendments are expected to result in the deconsolidation of many entities, the
Company will need to reevaluate all its previous consolidation conclusions. The amendments became effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect these amendments
to have a material effect on its financial statements.

amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In
August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. As a result of the deferral,
the guidance in ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company

amounts that occur after the effective date. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB amended the Income Taxes topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to simplify the presentation of

of financial position. The amendments will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company will apply the guidance prospectively. The Company does
not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In
January 2016, the FASB amended the Financial Instruments topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to address certain aspects
of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the guidance
by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments
related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values will be applied prospectively to equity investments that
exist as of the date of adoption of the amendments. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on
its financial statements.  

In

In
March 2016, the FASB amended the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to clarify that a change
in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument does not, in and of itself,

upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of
the equity method. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

Note
5 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements-continued    

In
March 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to

material effect on its financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions
including the income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on
the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the guidance simplifies two areas specific to entities other than public business entities
allowing them to apply a practical expedient to estimate the expected term for all awards with performance or service conditions
that have certain characteristics and also allowing them to make a one-time election to switch from measuring all liability-classified
awards at fair value to measuring them at intrinsic value. The amendments will be effective for the Company for annual periods

for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have
a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

Note
6   Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

The Company
adopted FASB ASC Fair Value Measurement Topic 820, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received
for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level l   
       Quoted
                                         prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level 2   
       Observable
                                         inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
                                         quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or
                                         can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
                                         assets or liabilities.  

Level 3   
      Unobservable
    inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted
    cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires
    significant management judgment or estimation.   

FASB ASC
825-10-50  Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments , requires the Company to disclose estimated fair
values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set forth below.  

Cash
and Short Term Investments     -  The carrying amount of these financial instruments (cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
bank balances, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell) approximates fair value. All mature within
90 days and do not present unanticipated credit concerns and are classified as Level 1.  

Investment
Securities   -    Measurement is on a recurring basis based upon quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques
such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for prepayment assumptions, projected credit losses, and liquidity. Level
1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, or by dealers or brokers in active
over-the-counter markets. Level 2 securities include MBSs issued both by government sponsored enterprises and PLMBSs. Generally
these fair values are priced from established pricing models. Level 3 securities include corporate debt obligations and asset backed
securities that are less liquid or for which there is an inactive market.  

Loans
Held for Sale     -  The Company originates fixed rate residential loans on a servicing released basis in the secondary
market. Loans closed but not yet settled with an investor, are carried in the Company s loans held for sale portfolio. These
loans are fixed rate residential loans that have been originated in the Company s name and have closed. Virtually all of
these loans have commitments to be purchased by investors at a locked in price with the investors on the same day that the loan
was locked in with the company s customers. Therefore, these loans present very little market risk for the Company and are
classified as Level 2. The carrying amount of these loans approximates fair value.  

Loans
-  The fair value of loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar
loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities and are classified as
Level 2. As discount rates are based on current loan rates as well as management estimates, the fair values presented may not
be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale. Loans which are deemed to be impaired are primarily valued on a
nonrecurring basis at the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. Such fair values are obtained using
independent appraisals, which the Company considers to be Level 3 inputs.   

Note
6   Fair Value of Financial Instruments - continued    

Other
Real Estate Owned (OREO)   -  OREO is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value on a non-recurring basis. Fair
value is based upon independent appraisals or management s estimation of the collateral and is considered a Level 3 measurement.  

Accrued
Interest Receivable  - The fair value approximates the carrying value and is classified as Level 1.  

Deposits
-  The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and money market accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting
date. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposits is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates
currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Deposits are classified as Level 2.  

Federal
Home Loan Bank Advances   -  Fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows using current market rates for borrowings
with similar terms and are classified as Level 2.  

Short
Term Borrowings   -  The carrying value of short term borrowings (securities sold under agreements to repurchase and demand
notes to the Treasury) approximates fair value. These are classified as Level 2.  

Junior
Subordinated Debentures -  The fair values of junior subordinated debentures is estimated by using discounted cash flow analyses
based on incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. These are classified as Level 2.  

Accrued
Interest Payable   - The fair value approximates the carrying value and is classified as Level 1.  

Commitments
to Extend Credit  - The fair value of these commitments is immaterial because their underlying interest rates approximate market.

The Company
has a large percentage of loans with real estate serving as collateral. Loans which are deemed to be impaired are primarily valued
on a nonrecurring basis at the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. Such fair values are obtained using independent
appraisals, which the Company considers to be Level 3 inputs. Third party appraisals are generally obtained when a loan is
identified as being impaired or at the time it is transferred to OREO. This internal process consists of evaluating the underlying
collateral to independently obtained comparable properties. With respect to less complex or smaller credits, an internal evaluation
may be performed. The independent and internal evaluations are generally updated annually. Factors considered in determining the
fair value include geographic sales trends, the value of comparable surrounding properties as well as the condition of the property.
The aggregate amount of impaired loans was $5.7 million and $6.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.

Note
8   Subsequent Events     

Subsequent
events   are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued.
Recognized subsequent events are events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the
date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements.  Nonrecognized
subsequent events are events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose
after that date.  Management has reviewed events occurring through the date the financial statements were available to be
issued and no subsequent events occurred requiring accrual or disclosure.  

Item 2.       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This
report contains statements which constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may relate to, among
other matters, the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business of our Company.
Forward-looking statements are based on many assumptions and estimates and are not guarantees of future performance. Our actual
results may differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, as they will depend on many factors about
which we are unsure, including many factors which are beyond our control. The words  may,   would,   could, 
 should,   will,   expect,   anticipate,   predict,   project, 
 potential,   continue,   assume,   believe,   intend,   plan, 
 forecast,   goal,  and  estimate,  as well as similar expressions, are meant to identify
such forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from
those anticipated in our forward-looking statements include, without limitation, those described under the heading  Risk
Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  SEC ) and the following:  

credit
                                         losses as a result of, among other potential factors, declining real estate values, increasing
                                         interest rates, increasing unemployment, changes in customer payment behavior or other
                                         factors;

   Overview   

  The
following discussion describes our results of operations for the nine months and three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the nine month and three month periods ended September 30, 2015 and also analyzes our financial condition as of September 30,
2016 as compared to December 31, 2015. Like most community banks, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our
loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on which we pay interest.
Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income
on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits.
Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing
liabilities.  

  There
are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that
may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating
earnings. In the following section we have included a discussion of this process, as well as several tables describing our allowance
for loan losses and the allocation of this allowance among our various categories of loans.  

  In
addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers.
We describe the various components of this non-interest income, as well as our non-interest expense, in the following discussion.  

The
following discussion and analysis identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results
during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in
conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report.  

   Critical
Accounting Policies    

  We
have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant
accounting policies are described in the footnotes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016
and our notes included in the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.  

Certain
accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain
assets and liabilities. We consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgment and assumptions
we use are based on historical experience and other factors, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because
of the nature of the judgment and assumptions we make, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could
have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.  

Allowance
for Loan Losses   

We
believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgment and estimates
used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Some of the more critical judgments supporting the amount of our
allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit worthiness of borrowers, the estimated value of the underlying collateral,
the assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses, the impact of current events, and
conditions, and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses. Under different conditions or using different assumptions,
the actual amount of credit losses incurred by us may be different from management s estimates provided in our consolidated
financial statements. Refer to the portion of this discussion that addresses our allowance for loan losses for a more complete
discussion of our processes and methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses.  

Goodwill
and Other Intangibles   

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated
for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment
loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value. Qualitative factors are assessed
to first determine if it is more likely than not (more than 50%) that the carrying value of goodwill is less than fair value.
These qualitative factors include but are not limited to overall deterioration in general economic conditions, industry and market
conditions, and overall financial performance. If determined that it is more likely than not that there has been a deterioration
in the fair value of the carrying value than the first of a two-step process would be performed. The first step, used to identify
potential impairment, involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill.
If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the
carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to
measure the amount of impairment.  

If
required, the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step
indicated impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated
in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first
step, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting
unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill
assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds
the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss cannot exceed the
carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal
of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. Management has determined that the Company has four reporting units (See Note
8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  

Core
deposit intangibles consist of costs that resulted from the acquisition of deposits from Savannah River and First South. Core
deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in this transaction. These costs
are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the deposit accounts acquired on a method that we believe reasonably approximates
the anticipated benefit stream from the accounts. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness.  

Income
Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities   

Income
taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes
currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities,
including available-for-sale securities, allowance for loan losses, write downs of OREO properties, accumulated depreciation,
net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, and pension plan and post-retirement
benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will
either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be
realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is  more likely than not  that a deferred tax asset
will not be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the
provision for income taxes. We file a consolidated federal income tax return for the Bank. At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, we were in a net deferred tax asset position.  

Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment    

We
evaluate securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis. Consideration is given to (1) the length
of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of
the issuer, (3) the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments, (4) the anticipated outlook for changes
in the general level of interest rates, and (5) our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is more-likely-than-not
that the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value (See Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements).  

Business
Combinations, Method of Accounting for Loans Acquired   

We
account for acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations , which requires the use of the acquisition method
of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses related
to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date because the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions
regarding credit risk.  

Acquired
credit-impaired loans are accounted for under the accounting guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated
credit quality, found in FASB ASC Topic 310-30,  Receivables Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit
Quality.  and initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over
the life of the loans. Loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of credit deterioration are considered impaired.
Loans acquired through business combinations that do not meet the specific criteria of FASB ASC Topic 310-30, but for which a
discount is attributable, at least in part to credit quality, are also accounted for under this guidance. Certain acquired loans,
including performing loans and revolving lines of credit (consumer and commercial), are accounted for in accordance with FASB
ASC Topic 310-20, where the discount is accreted through earnings based on estimated cash flows over the estimated life of the
loan.  

Comparison
of Results of Operations for Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Net Income

Our
net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.9 million or $0.72 diluted earnings per common share, as compared
to $4.5 million or $0.68 diluted earnings per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net interest income increased
$760 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase resulted from
an increase in average earning assets, which increased by $51.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the same period in 2015. Average earning assets were $759.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared
to $810.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The net interest margin decreased to 3.24% during the first
nine months of 2016 as compared to 3.33% during the first nine months of 2015. Non-interest income decreased by $135 thousand
in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. This was primarily attributable to a decrease in mortgage
banking income and investment advisory fees and non-deposit commissions of $164 thousand and $122 thousand, respectively, in the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Non-interest expense in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 increased $702 thousand as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in salary and benefit
expense of $654 thousand from $10.8 million in the first nine months of 2015 to $11.5 million in the first nine months of 2016.  

   Net Interest
Income   

Please
refer to the table at the end of this Item 2 for the yield and rate data for interest-bearing balance sheet components during
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, along with average balances and the related interest income and interest
expense amounts.  

Net
interest income was $19.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $18.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The $760 thousand increase in net interest income was attributable to an increase in average earning
assets of $51.7 million partially offset by a decrease of 9 basis points in the net interest margin between the two periods. Our
net interest margin decreased 9 basis points from 3.33% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 3.24% for the same period
in 2016. The net interest margin was positively impacted during the first nine months of 2016 as a result of two pay-offs on purchased
credit impaired loans. These two payoffs accounted for approximately 5 basis points in our net-interest margin for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, the net interest margin was positively impacted by an investment
that had been purchased at a discount and was called at par during the second quarter of 2016. The $82 thousand remaining discount
recognized in interest income accounted for approximately 2 basis points of the net interest margin for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. The yield on earning assets decreased by 15 basis points in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the
same period in 2015. Average loans comprised 62.6% of average earning assets in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 61.7%
in the same period of 2015. The yield on our loan portfolio decreased 33 basis points in the nine month-period ended September
30, 2016 to 4.63% as compared to 4.96% during the same period in 2015. As previously noted, the yield on loans was positively
impacted by recognizing the discount on two purchased impaired loans that paid off in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The yield on our investment portfolio increased from 1.94% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 2.04% for the same
period in 2016. The previously mentioned $82 thousand discount recognized on a called bond accounted for approximately 4 basis
points of the investment yield increase between the two periods. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities during the first nine
months of 2016 was 0.50% as compared to 0.56% in the same period of 2015, reflecting a 6 basis point decrease. The continued focus
and resulting shift in our deposit funding mix has continued to allow us to lower our overall cost of funds. Interest-bearing
transaction accounts, money market accounts and savings deposits, which are typically our lower costing funds, represent 61.5%
of our average interest bearing liabilities during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 58.1% in the same period of 2015.  

   Provision
and Allowance for Loan Losses   

  At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $5.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively. This
represented 0.96% of total loans and 0.94% of total loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. No allowance
for loan losses related to the Savannah River acquired loans was recorded on the acquisition date, February 1, 2014, because the
fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk. Loans acquired were recorded at the acquisition
date fair value, which was based on expected cash flows and included an estimation of expected future loan losses for the purchased
credit-impaired loans, including principal and interest. There have been no material adjustments to our original assumptions since
the acquisition date. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses plus the fair value adjustment
related to credit as a percentage of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) was 1.03% and 1.15%, respectively. Our provision
for loan losses was $536 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $990 thousand for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. This provision is made based on our assessment of general loan loss risk and asset quality. The allowance
for loan losses represents an amount which we believe will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become
uncollectible. Our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a number of assumptions about future
events, which we believe to be reasonable, but which may or may not prove to be accurate. Our determination of the allowance for
loan losses is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans, including consideration of factors such as the balance of
impaired loans, the quality, mix, and size of our overall loan portfolio, the experience ability and depth of lending personnel,
economic conditions (local and national) that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the amount and quality of collateral
securing the loans, our historical loan loss experience, and a review of specific problem loans. We also consider subjective issues
such as changes in the lending policies and procedures, changes in the local/national economy, changes in volume or type of credits,
changes in volume/severity of problem loans, quality of loan review and board of director oversight, and concentrations of credit.
Periodically, we adjust the amount of the allowance based on changing circumstances. We charge recognized losses to the allowance
and add subsequent recoveries back to the allowance for loan losses.  

  We
perform an analysis quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio. The portfolio is segregated into similar risk components
for which historical loss ratios are calculated and adjusted for identified changes in current portfolio characteristics. Historical
loss ratios are calculated by product type and by regulatory credit risk classification (See Note 4   Loans). The annualized
weighted average loss ratios over the last 36 months for loans classified substandard, special mention and pass have been approximately
5.70%, 3.11% and 0.04%, respectively. The allowance consists of an allocated and unallocated allowance. The allocated portion
is determined by types and ratings of loans within the portfolio. The unallocated portion of the allowance is established for
losses that exist in the remainder of the portfolio and compensates for uncertainty in estimating the loan losses. The allocated
portion of the allowance is based on historical loss experience as well as certain qualitative factors as explained above. The
qualitative factors have been established based on certain assumptions made as a result of the current economic conditions and
are adjusted as conditions change to be directionally consistent with these changes. The unallocated portion of the allowance
is composed of factors based on management s evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the estimation
of probable losses through the experience formula or specific allowances. The unallocated allowance of the portfolio is primarily
identified through discussions with senior credit management and through consideration of various portfolio specifics and other
uncertainties outside of our markets that could impact the risk inherent in the portfolio. These include factors such as uncertainty
as to a sustainable economic recovery, ongoing global economic conditions and sustained levels of high national unemployment.
Given these uncertainties in economic conditions and particularly real estate valuations, we do not believe it would be prudent
to reduce substantially the overall level of our allowance at this time. As economic conditions show sustainable improvement,
we believe the unallocated portion of the allowance should decrease as a percentage of the total allowance.  

Our
loan portfolio consists of a large percentage of real estate secured loans. Impaired values of the underlying real estate collateral
as well as a slowdown in both residential and commercial real estate sales could impact our ability to sell collateral upon foreclosure.  The
real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may
deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended.  If real estate values decline, it is also more likely
that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses.  If during a period of reduced real estate values
we are required to liquidate the property collateralizing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase the allowance for loan losses,
it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition.    

Non-performing
assets were $5.2 million (0.57% of total assets) at September 30, 2016 as compared to $5.9 million (0.66% of total assets),
$7.5 million (0.86% of total assets) and $7.3 million (0.85% of total assets) at June 30, 2016, March 31, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. While we believe our amount of non-performing assets compares favorably to current industry results (both
nationally and locally), we continue to be concerned about the impact of this economic environment on our customer base of local
businesses and professionals. There were 40 loans, totaling $4.0 million, included in non-performing status (non-accrual loans
and loans past due 90 days and still accruing) at September 30, 2016. The largest non-performing loan is a $964 thousand first
mortgage on developed lots to be sold for residential use. The average balance of the remaining 38 loans is approximately $105.0
thousand and the majority of these loans are secured by first mortgage liens. At the time the loans are placed in non-accrual
status, we typically obtain an updated appraisal and, if the loan balance exceeds fair value, write the balance down to the fair
value. At September 30, 2016, we had one loan delinquent more than 90 days in the amount of $99 thousand and still accruing interest.
At September 30, 2016, we had loans totaling $2.7 million that were delinquent 30 days to 89 days which represented 0.52% of total
loans.  

Our
management continuously monitors non-performing, classified and past due loans to identify deterioration regarding the condition
of these loans. We have identified one loan relationship in the amount of $1.1 million that is current as to principal and interest
and not included in non-performing assets that could represent a potential problem loan. This balance is included as substandard
loans in Note 4 of the financial statements.

The
following allocation of the allowance to specific components is not necessarily indicative of future losses or future allocations.
The entire allowance is available to absorb losses in the portfolio.  

Composition
of the Allowance for Loan Losses   

Accrual
of interest is discontinued on loans when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection
efforts that a borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful. A delinquent loan is
generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days or more past due. At the time a loan is placed in nonaccrual status,
all interest, which has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported
interest income. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes
reasonably certain.  

Non-interest
Income and Non-interest Expense   

Non-interest
income during the first nine months of 2016 was $6.7 million as compared to $6.9 million during the same period in 2015. Mortgage
banking income decreased $164 thousand during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, resulting primarily
from the resignation of one mortgage loan producer in the first quarter of 2016. Investment advisory fees and non-deposit commissions
decreased by $122 thousand in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. During the first nine months
of 2015, we had one transaction that is non-recurring that accounted for substantially all of the difference between the two periods.
Management continues to focus on increasing this recurring source of revenue by increasing total assets under management. We had
assets under management of $195.1 million and $168.6 million at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. During
the first nine months of 2016, we sold investment securities for a net gain of $601 thousand as compared to a gain on the sale
of investment securities of $271 thousand in the same period of 2015. These gains in 2016 were partially offset by prepayment
penalties in the amount of $459 thousand and $103 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid down advances of $11.4 million as compared to $2.7 million in the same
period of 2015. Non-interest income other increased by $256 thousand in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same
period in 2015. This increase resulted from increased ATM/debit card income of $103 thousand in first nine months of 2016 as compared
to the same period in 2015. In addition, income recognized on bank owned life insurance increased by $149 thousand in the 2016
period as compared to the 2015 period. At the end of 2015 the Bank purchased additional bank owned life insurance which accounts
for the increased income.  

Total non-interest
expense increased by $702 thousand, or 3.8%, during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Salary
and benefit expense increased $654 thousand from $10.8 million in the first nine months of 2015 to $11.5 million in the first
nine months of 2016. This increase is primarily a result of the normal salary adjustments, the additional staff including the
new Greenville loan production office staff in the first quarter of 2016, as well as increased medical benefit premiums. At September
30, 2015, we had 184 full time equivalent employees as compared to 201 at September 30, 2016. Occupancy expense increased $103
thousand in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015. The increase in occupancy expense primarily
relates to repair costs associated with the fourth quarter 2015 flooding and rain that were not previously identified and determined
not to be covered by insurance in the approximate amount of $50 thousand as well as occupancy cost of $23 thousand associated
with opening the Greenville loan production office. Marketing and public relations expense decreased from $683 thousand in the
first nine months of 2015 to $529 thousand in the first nine months of 2016. The timing of our media campaigns impact the recognition
of marketing expense and, in 2015, more of these costs were incurred in the first half of the year. It is expected that we will
have higher media costs in the fourth quarter of 2016. Other real estate expense decreased $247 thousand in the first nine months
of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This reflects the overall decrease in the level of our repossessed real estate
assets between the two periods. Non-interest expense  Other  increased by $380 thousand in the first nine months of
2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase is primarily a result of increased ATM/debit card activity charges
of $183 thousand during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. We incurred $64 thousand in costs
associated with the mass reissue of our debit cards to implement the new EMV (chip) card in the first nine months of 2016. We
have also had significantly higher levels of attempted fraud activity on our card base in the first nine months of 2016 as compared
to the same period in 2015. There is a direct cost assessed by our processor for each card that is compromised or had attempted
fraud activity. The higher level of fraud cases in the first nine months of 2016 accounted for approximately $43 thousand in debit
card losses. We believe the  chip  card technology will ultimately reduce the level of fraud activity and losses on
debit cards. Also included in the increase of  Other  non-interest expense were costs of approximately $23 thousand
related to converting our current bill pay system to another vendor. This conversion was completed in the second quarter of 2016.  

The
following is a summary of the components of other non-interest expense for the periods indicated:  

Income
Tax Expense   

Our effective
tax rate was 26.0% and 27.5% in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result of our current level of tax
exempt securities in our investment portfolio, our effective tax rate is expected to remain at 26.0% to 27.0% throughout the remainder
of 2016.   

Comparison
of Results of Operations for Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015:   

Net Income   

Our
net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was substantially unchanged at $1.7 million, or $0.25 diluted
earnings per common share, for each of these periods. Net interest income increased $398 thousand for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was offset by increased non-interest expense of $516 thousand for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015.  

   Net Interest
Income   

Please refer
to the table  Yields on Average Earning Assets and Rates on Average Interest-Bearing Liabilities  appearing at the
end of this Item for the yield and rate data for interest-bearing balance sheet components during the three-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, along with average balances and the related interest income and interest expense amounts.  

Net interest
income increased by $398 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $6.7 million as compared to $6.2 million in
the same period in 2015. Our net interest margin in the third quarter of 2016 was 3.19% compared to 3.22% in the same period of
2015. The yield on average earning assets decreased 12 basis points to 3.55% in the third quarter of 2016 from 3.67% in the third
quarter of 2015. The extended period of historically low interest rates continues to put pressure on our net interest margin.
We believe we can continue to offset some of this margin pressure by continuing to remix our balance sheet asset mix out of investments
into the loan portfolio. Average earning assets were $829.8 million during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $769.5 million
during the third quarter of 2015. Average loans were $520.1 million (62.7% of earning assets) in the third quarter of 2016 and
$482.2 million (62.7% of earning assets) in the third quarter of 2015. The cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to 0.47%
in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 0.57% in the third quarter of 2015. Interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market
accounts and savings deposits, which are typically our lower costing funds, represent 61.9% of our average interest bearing liabilities
during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 58.6% in the same period of 2015. Due to the continued historically low interest
rate environment, the cost of these funds has remained very stable over the last several years. The current low cost of these
funds do not provide significant ability to offset further interest rate declines or a flattening of the yield curve.  

Provision
for Loan Losses   

  The
provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $179 thousand as compared to $193 thousand for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. As previously discussed, the provision is made based on our assessment of general loan
loss risk and asset quality, historical loss experience and various other qualitative factors.  

   Non-interest
Income and Non-interest Expense   

For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, we had non-interest income of $2.4 million as compared to non-interest income of $2.3 million
in the same period of 2015. Mortgage banking income decreased slightly by $27 thousand during the third quarter of 2016, as compared
to the same period in 2015. Gains on the sale of securities in the third quarter of 2016 amounted to $478 thousand. As noted above,
the sales were offset by prepayment penalties of $459 thousand resulting from the pay down of approximately $11.4 million in Federal
Home Loan Bank Advances. There were no gains on sale of securities or prepayment penalties during the third quarter of 2015. Non-interest
income other increased by $58 thousand in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. As mentioned above,
this increase resulted primarily from increased income recognized on bank owned life insurance.  

Total non-interest
expense increased $516 thousand in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the same period of 2015. Salaries and benefits increased
$293 thousand in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase is primarily a result of normal
salary adjustments and additional staff to include the four employees that were added as a result of the expansion of the loan
production office in Greenville, South Carolina. Marketing and public relations expense increased $111 thousand in the third quarter
of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. As noted in the nine month results, the timing of our media marketing campaign
was designed to be concentrated more in the first half of the year for 2015 and later in the year during 2016. FDIC assessments
decreased by $53 thousand in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Beginning on July 1, 2016, the
FDIC adjusted the assessment formula and the new assessment should reduce our assessment by approximately 45% as compared to the
last several years. Non-interest expense  Other  increased $171 thousand in the third quarter of 2016 as compared
to the same period of 2015.  

Financial
Position   

Assets
totaled $915.3 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $862.7 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $52.6 million.
Loans increased by approximately $34.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Loans (excluding loans held for
sale) at September 30, 2016 were $523.4 million as compared to $489.2 million at December 31, 2015. Total loan production was
$114.2 million during the first nine months of 2016. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans (excluding loans held
for sale) accounted for 62.3% and 62.1% of earning assets, respectively. The loan-to-deposit ratio at September 30, 2016 was 68.9%
as compared to 68.7% at December 31, 2015. Investment securities increased to $288.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $283.8
million at December 31, 2015. Deposits increased $49.7 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015. Pure deposits
(deposits less time deposits) represented 75.7% of total deposits as of September 30, 2016 as compared to 74.7% at December 31,
2015. We continue to focus on growing our pure deposits as a percentage of total deposits in order to better manage our overall
cost of funds. Deposits were $765.9 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $716.2 million at December 31, 2015. FHLB advances
decreased $3.8 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. This decrease represents pay downs of $11.4 million in term
advances during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the addition of $8.0 million in overnight advances as of the end
of the quarter.  

The
following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio by category at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

In
the context of this discussion, a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan, other than loans for construction purposes
and advances on home equity lines of credit, secured by real estate, regardless of the purpose of the loan. Advances on home equity
lines of credit are included in consumer loans. We follow the common practice of financial institutions in our market areas of
obtaining a security interest in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral
is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate
loan components. Generally we limit the loan-to-value ratio to 80%.  

Market
Risk Management   

The
effective management of market risk is essential to achieving our strategic financial objectives. Our most significant market
risk is interest rate risk. We have established an Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ) to monitor and manage
interest rate risk. The ALCO monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of assets and liabilities in order to diminish the
potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on net interest income. The ALCO has established policy guidelines
and strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity.  

A
monitoring technique employed by the ALCO is the measurement of interest sensitivity  gap,  which is the positive
or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period
of time. Simulation modeling is performed to assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have
on net interest income. We model the impact on net interest income for several different changes, to include a flattening, steepening
and parallel shift in the yield curve. For each of these scenarios, we model the impact on net interest income in an increasing
and decreasing rate environment of 100 and 200 basis points. Policies have been established in an effort to maintain the maximum
anticipated negative impact of these modeled changes in net interest income at no more than 10% and 15% respectively, in a 100
and 200 basis point change in interest rates over a twelve month period. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing
assets or liabilities, selling securities available-for-sale, replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the
interest rate during the life of an asset or liability. Managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time
interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates.  

We
are currently asset sensitive within one year. However, neither the  gap  analysis nor asset/liability simulation
modeling is a precise indicator of our interest sensitivity position due to the many factors that affect net interest income,
including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  

Net Interest
Income Sensitivity   

The
decrease in net interest income in a down 200 basis point environment primarily results from the current level of interest rates
being paid on our interest bearing transaction accounts as well as money market accounts. The interest rates on these accounts
are at a level where they cannot be repriced in proportion to the change in interest rates. At the current historically low interest
rate levels, we believe that a downward shift of 200 basis points across the entire yield curve is unlikely.  

  We
also perform a valuation analysis projecting future cash flows from assets and liabilities to determine the Present Value of Equity
( PVE ) over a range of changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity of PVE to changes in interest rates is a
measure of the sensitivity of earnings over a longer time horizon. At September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016, March 31, 2016 and December
31 2015, the PVE exposure in a plus 200 basis point increase in market interest rates was estimated to be +4.06%, +5.73% ,+3.49%
and -0.07%, respectively.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
believe our liquidity remains adequate to meet operating and loan funding requirements. Interest-bearing bank balances, federal
funds sold, and investment securities available-for-sale represent 32.1% of total assets at September 30, 2016. We believe that
our existing stable base of core deposits along with continued growth in this deposit base will enable us to meet our long-term
and short-term liquidity needs successfully. These needs include the ability to respond to short-term demand for funds caused
by the withdrawal of deposits, maturity of repurchase agreements, extensions of credit and the payment of operating expenses.
Other sources of liquidity, in addition to deposit gathering activities, include maturing loans and investments, purchase of federal
funds from other financial institutions and selling securities under agreements to repurchase. We monitor closely the level of
large certificates of deposits in amounts of $100 thousand or more as they tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes
and, thus, less reliable sources of funding for liquidity purposes. At September 30, 2016, the amount of certificates of deposits
of $100 thousand or more represented 12.3% of total deposits and the amount of certificates of deposits of $250 thousand or more
represented 4.9% of deposits. The majority of these deposits are issued to local customers many of whom have other product relationships
with the Bank.  

Through
the operations of our Bank, we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities.
These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified
period of time. At September 30, 2016, we had issued commitments to extend credit of $81.0 million, including $31.0 million in
unused home equity lines of credit, through various types of lending arrangements. We evaluate each customer s credit worthiness
on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit, is based on our
credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment,
commercial and residential real estate. We manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting
and risk management processes.  

Other
than as described elsewhere in this report, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that we expect to result in
a significant adverse effect on our liquidity position. However, no assurances can be given in this regard, as rapid growth, deterioration
in loan quality, and poor earnings, or a combination of these factors, could change the liquidity position in a relatively short
period of time.  

The
Company has generally maintained a high level of liquidity and adequate capital, which along with continued retained earnings,
we believe will be sufficient to fund the operations of the Bank for at least the next 12 months. Shareholders  equity was
9.2% of total assets at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Bank maintains federal funds purchased lines in the
total amount of $20.0 million with two financial institutions, although these were not utilized in the first half of 2016. Specific
investment securities would be pledged if and when we were to utilize this line. The FHLB of Atlanta has approved a line of credit
of up to 25% of the Bank s assets, which when utilized is collateralized by a pledge against specific investment securities
and/or eligible loans. We regularly review the liquidity position of the Company and have implemented internal policies establishing
guidelines for sources of asset based liquidity and evaluate and monitor the total amount of purchased funds used to support the
balance sheet and funding from noncore sources. We believe that our existing stable base of core deposits along with continued
growth in this deposit base will enable us to meet our long term liquidity needs successfully.  

Regulatory
capital rules released by the federal bank regulatory agencies in July 2013 to implement capital standards, referred to as Basel
III and developed by an international body known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, impose higher minimum capital
requirements for certain bank holding companies and for banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations
regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with $500 million or more in total consolidated
assets. However, in May 2015, amendments to the Federal Reserve Board s small bank holding company policy statement (the
 SBHC Policy ) became effective which increased the asset threshold to quality to utilize the provisions of the SBHC
Policy from $500 million to $1.0 billion. Bank holding companies which are subject to the SBHC Policy are not subject to compliance
with the regulatory capital requirements until they exceed $1.0 billion in assets. As a consequence, as of September 30, 2016,
the Company was not required to comply with the requirements set forth below until such time that its consolidated total assets
exceed $1.0 billion or the Federal Reserve Board determines that the Company is no longer deemed to be a small bank holding company.
However, if the Company had been subject to the requirements, it is management s belief that it would have been in compliance
with such requirements. More stringent requirements are imposed on  advanced approaches  banking organizations  
which are organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, with $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures,
or that have opted in to the Basel II capital regime. The new regulatory capital rules became effective on January 1, 2015 (subject
to a phase-in period for certain provisions), and all of the requirements in the rules will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.  

The
final rule includes certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically,
the following minimum capital requirements apply to the Bank and, absent the Company being subject to the SBHC Policy, would apply
to the Company:  

a
                                         new Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;    

a
                                         Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);    

a
                                         total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from former requirements); and    

a
                                         leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).    

Under
the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital.
The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained
earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock.
Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to
continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital,
but not in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, subject to certain restrictions. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently
qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rules have disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual
preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Accumulated other comprehensive
income ( AOCI ) is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category
of capital. The rules provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations
to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We elected to opt out from the inclusion of AOCI in Common Equity Tier 1 capital.  

In
addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking
organization must maintain a  capital conservation buffer  on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier
1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully
effective on January 1, 2019, and will consist of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
As of January 1, 2016, we are required to hold a capital conservation buffer of 0.625%, increasing by that amount each successive
year until 2019.  

In
general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including
high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights
not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator
of the three risk-based capital ratios.  

The
Bank s risk-based capital ratios of leverage ratio, Tier 1, and total capital were 9.7%, 14.4%, and 15.3%, respectively,
at September 30, 2016 as compared to 9.7%, 14.7%, and 15.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. The Bank s CET1 ratio at
September 30, 2016 was 14.4% and 14.7% at December 31, 2015. The Company s risk-based capital ratios of leverage ratio,
Tier 1, and total capital were 10.2%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively at September 30, 2016 as compared to 10.2%, 15.4% and 16.2%,
respectively at December 31, 2015. The Company s CET1 ratio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 12.7% and 12.9%,
respectively. Our management anticipates that the Bank and the Company will remain a well-capitalized institution for at least
the next 12 months.  

Since
the Company is a bank holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal and state regulatory
considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement
regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board s policies provide that
dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding
company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal
Reserve Board s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary
banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial
stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for
assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. In addition, under the prompt corrective action regulations, the ability of a
bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies
could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.  

In
addition, since the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and does not conduct stand-alone operations,
its ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to it, which is also subject to regulatory restrictions.
As a South Carolina chartered bank, the Bank is subject to limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay.
Unless otherwise instructed by the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions, the Bank is generally permitted under South
Carolina State banking regulations to pay cash dividends of up to 100% of net income in any calendar year without obtaining the
prior approval of the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions. The FDIC also has the authority under federal law to enjoin
a bank from engaging in what in its opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business, including the
payment of a dividend under certain circumstances.

Item
3.      Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.    

There

disclosure.
