NOTE 1:- 
 
 GENERAL

a. 
 
 SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (the  Company ) and its subsidiaries design, develop, and sell an intelligent inverter solution designed to maximize power generation at the individual photovoltaic ( PV ) module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar PV system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features .  The Company s products consist mainly of (i) power optimizers designed to maximize energy throughput from each and every module through constant tracking of Maximum Power Point individually per module, (ii) inverters which invert direct current (DC) from the PV module to alternating current (AC) and (iii) a related cloud-based monitoring platform, that collects and processes information from the power optimizers and inverters of a solar PV system to enable customers and system owners as applicable, to monitor and manage the solar PV systems. In addition, the Company has a storage solution that is used to increase energy independence and maximize self-consumption for homeowners by utilizing a battery that is sold separately by third party manufacturers, to store and supply power as needed (the  StorEdge solution ). The StorEdge solution is designed to provide smart energy functions such as maximizing self-consumption, Time-of-Use programming for desired hours of the day, and home energy backup solutions.

The Company and its subsidiaries sells its products worldwide directly to large solar installers and engineering, procurement and construction firms ( EPCs ), as well as through large distributors and electrical equipment wholesalers to smaller solar installers.

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in August 2006 and began commercial sale of its products in January 2010.

b. 
 
 Recent accounting pronouncements:

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result in the more timely recognition of losses. ASU 2016-13 also applies to employee benefit plan accounting, with an effective date of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, footnote disclosures and employee benefit plans  accounting.

c. 
 
 The significant accounting policies applied in the Company s audited annual consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2016 are applied consistently in these financial statements.

d. 
 
 Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying unaudited  condensed  consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation S-X,  Interim Financial Statements  and the rules and regulations for Form 10-Q of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Pursuant to those rules and regulations, the Company has condensed or omitted certain information and footnote disclosure it normally includes in its annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).

In management s opinion, the Company has made all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments, except as otherwise indicated) necessary to fairly present its condensed   consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company s interim period operating results do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year. These financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the 2016 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on August 17, 2016 (the  2016 Form 10-K ). There have been no changes in the significant accounting policies from those that were disclosed in the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 included in the 2016 Form 10-K.

In August 2016, the Company announced that its fiscal year-end will begin on January 1 and end on December 31 of each year, starting on January 1, 2017.

Fiscal year 2016, which ended on June 30, 2016, will be followed by a transition period from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The Company plans to disclose the results of the transition period on a form 10-KT transition report.

e. 
 
 The Company depends on two contract manufacturers and several limited or single source component suppliers. Reliance on these vendors makes the Company vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over component availability, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs.

Two vendors collectively account for 62.8% (unaudited) and 69% of the Company s total trade payables as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and June 30, 2016, respectively.

The Company has the right to offset its payables to one of its contract manufacturers against vendor non-trade receivables. As of September 30, 2016 a total of $2,177 of these receivables met the criteria for net recognition and were offset against the corresponding accounts payable balances for this contract manufacturer in the accompanying condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

f. 
 
 Derivative financial instruments:

The Company accounts for derivatives and hedging based on ASC 815 ( Derivatives and Hedging ). ASC 815 requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.

To protect against the increase in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from salary payments of its Israeli facilities denominated in the Israeli currency, the New Israeli Shekels ( NIS ), during the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. The Company hedges portions of the anticipated payroll payments denominated in NIS for a period of one to twelve months with hedging contracts. Accordingly, when the dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in present value of future foreign currency expenses is offset by losses in the fair value of the hedging contracts. Conversely, when the dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is offset by gains in the fair value of the hedging contracts. These hedging contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, as defined by ASC 815 and are all effective hedges.

In accordance with ASC 815, for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e. hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any gain or loss on a derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item is recognized in current earnings during the period of change.

In addition to the above mentioned cash flow hedges transactions, the Company also entered into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge the Company s exposure to currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These derivative instruments are not designated as cash flows hedges, as defined by ASC 815, and therefore all gains and losses, resulted from fair value remeasurements, were recorded immediately in the statement of operations, as financial expenses, net.

As of September 30, 2016, the Company entered into forward contracts and put and call options to sell U.S. dollars for NIS and Euros for U.S. dollars in the amount of $8,846 and 15 million Euro, respectively. These hedging contracts do not contain any credit-risk-related contingency features. See Note 5 for information on the fair value of these hedging contracts.

 REVOLVING CREDIT LINE

In June 2011, the Company entered into an agreement for a revolving line of credit from a Bank Lender (the "Bank Lender").

On February 17, 2015, the Company amended and restated the agreement with the Bank Lender for a revolving line of credit, which permits aggregate borrowings of up to $40 million in an amount not to exceed 80% of the eligible accounts receivable and bears interest, payable monthly, at the Bank Lender s prime rate plus a margin of 0.5% to 2.0%. The amended and restated revolving line of credit will terminate, and outstanding borrowings will be payable, on December 31, 2016.

In connection with the amended and restated revolving line of credit, the Company granted the Bank Lender security interests in substantially all of the Company s assets, including a first priority security interest in the Company s trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents. Financial covenants contained in the agreement require the Company to maintain EBITDA and liquidity at specified levels.

The Company is required to maintain liquidity (defined as unrestricted and unencumbered cash, plus availability under the amended and restated revolving line of credit) of $6,750.

The amended and restated revolving line of credit also contains covenants that restrict the Company s ability to dispose of assets, engage in business combinations (or permit a subsidiary to engage in business combinations), grant liens, borrow money, or pay dividends.

NOTE 5:- 
 
 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company applies ASC 820 ( Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ), with respect to fair value measurements of all financial assets and liabilities.

Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.

A three-tiered fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:

Level 1- 
 
 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2- 
 
 Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.

Level 3- 
 
 Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.

The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

a. 
 
 Guarantees:

As of September 30, 2016 (unaudited), contingent liabilities exist regarding guarantees in the amount of $633, $53 and $85 in respect of office rent lease agreements, customs transactions and credit card limits, respectively.

b. 
 
 Royalty and Governmental commitments:

As of September 30, 2016 (unaudited), the aggregate contingent liability to the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD F) amounted to approximately $1,148 which would be payable by the Company if it ever did generate revenues from such project.

The Company s Israeli subsidiary receives research and development grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist (the OCS). In consideration for the research and development grants received from the OCS, the Company has undertaken to pay royalties as a percentage of revenues from products developed from research and development projects financed. If the Company will not generate sales of products developed with funds provided by the OCS, the Company is not obligated to pay royalties or repay the grants.

Royalties are payable at the rate of 4% to 4.5% from the time of commencement of sales of all of these products until the cumulative amount of the royalties paid equals 100% of the dollar-linked amounts of the grants received, plus interest at LIBOR rate.

As of September 30, 2016 (unaudited), the aggregate contingent liability to the OCS amounted to $999.

c. 
 
 Contractual purchase obligations:

The Company has contractual obligations to purchase goods and raw materials.

Overview

We have invented an intelligent inverter solution that has changed the way power is harvested and managed in a solar photovoltaic ( PV ) system. Our direct current ( DC ) optimized inverter system is designed to maximize power generation at the individual PV module level while lowering the cost of energy produced by the solar PV system and providing comprehensive and advanced safety features. Our systems allow for superior power harvesting and module management by deploying power optimizers at each PV module while maintaining a competitive system cost by using a simplified DC AC inverter. Our systems are monitored through our cloud-based monitoring platform that enables lower system operating and maintenance ( O M ) costs. We believe that these benefits, along with our comprehensive and advanced safety features, are highly valued by our customers.

Our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $128.5 million and $115.1 million, respectively. Gross margin was 32.6% and 29.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net income was $15.6 million and $14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

5 

As of September 30, 2016, we have shipped approximately 14.1 million power optimizers and 576,000 inverters. Approximately 298,900 installations, many of which may include multiple inverters, are currently connected to, and monitored through, our cloud based monitoring platform. As of September 30, 2016, we have shipped approximately 3.8 GW of our DC optimized inverter systems. Our products are sold in approximately 47 countries, and are installed in solar PV systems in 100 countries.

As of September 30, 2016, approximately 188,500 indirect customers had registered with us through our cloud based monitoring platform.

Recent Developments

In January 2016, we announced the commercial availability of our StorEdge TM  solutions.  Our StorEdge TM  solution allows homeowners to maximimze self-consumption and to enable independence, by storing unusued PV power in a battery and allowing such power to be used by the homeowner when needed.  The StorEdge TM  solution is based on a single inverter for both PV power generation and storage.

In February 2016, we shipped our ten millionth power optimizer.

In June 2016, we began shipments of our HD-Wave inverter

Key Operating Metrics

In managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the financial statements with other operating metrics. These operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and formulate projections. We use metrics relating to shipments (inverters shipped, power optimizers shipped and megawatts shipped) to evaluate our sales performance and to track market acceptance of our products. We use metrics relating to monitoring (systems monitored) to evaluate market acceptance of our products and usage of our solution.

We provide the  megawatts shipped  metric, which is calculated based on nameplate capacity shipped, to show adoption of our system on a nameplate capacity basis. Nameplate capacity shipped is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter and corresponds to our financial results in that higher total capacities shipped are generally associated with higher total revenues. However, revenues increase with each additional unit, not necessarily each additional MW of capacity, sold. Accordingly, we also provide the  inverters shipped  and  power optimizers shipped  operating metrics.

(1) 
 
 Calculated based on the aggregate nameplate capacity of inverters shipped during the applicable period. Nameplate capacity is the maximum rated power output capacity of an inverter as specified by the manufacturer.

Results of Operations

The results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

6 

The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Revenues

Revenues increased by $13.4 million, or 11.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold in the U.S.  and Europe. The number of power optimizers sold increased by approximately 0.2 million units, or 14.1%, from approximately 1.4 million units in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately 1.6 million units in the three months ended September 30, 2016. The number of inverters sold increased by approximately 14,200 units, or 28.5%, from approximately 49,800 units in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately 64,000 units in the three months ended September 30, 2016. Our blended average selling price per watt for units shipped decreased by $0.052, or 15.9%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to (i) an increase in sales of commercial products that are characterized by lower average selling prices per watt; (ii) price erosion in the overall inverter market; (iii) a change in our geographic mix, specifically in sales to Europe where the devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar in calendar 2016 reduced our average selling price when translated into U.S. Dollars; and (iv) a change in our customer mix, which included a higher portion of sales to large customers to whom we provide volume discounts.

7 

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of revenues increased by $5.1 million, or 6.2%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to (i) an increase in the volume of products sold; (ii) an increase in personnel-related costs resulting from an increase in our operations and support headcount; and (iii) increased warranty expenses associated with the increase in our installed base. These increases were partially offset by reductions derived from increased efficiency in our supply chain. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from 29.1% in the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 32.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to reductions in per unit production costs, increased efficiency in our supply chain and general economies of scale in our personnel-related costs and other costs associated with our support and operations departments.

Operating Expenses:

Research and Development, Net

Research and development, net increased by $2.9 million, or 42.1%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $2.5 million resulting from an increase in our research and development headcount. The increase in headcount reflects our continued investment in enhancing our existing products as well as activities associated with bringing new products to market. In addition, the use of external consultants and deprecation expenses  increased by $ 0.3  million and $0. 1  million, respectively,  in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 21.7%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $1.2 million due to an increase in headcount associated with supporting our growth in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, expenses related to trade shows and marketing activities, expenses related to external consultants and sub-contractorsand expenses associated with our worldwide sales offices, travel and other overhead costs increased by $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased by $0.2 million, or 7.2%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $0.4 million related to (i) higher headcount in the legal, finance, human resources, and information technology department functions required of a fast-growing public company and (ii) increased expenses related to  equity-based compensation and  changes in management and our board of director compensation .  In addition, costs related to accounting, tax, legal and information systems consulting and depreciation increased by $0.2 million. These amounts were offset by  costs related to the accrual of doubtful debts, which decreased in the amount of $0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.

8 

Financial income (expenses), net

Financial income was $0.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to financial expenses of $0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to $0.4 million of interest income, net of accretion (amortization) of discount (premium) on marketable securities and time deposits and a decrease in expenses related to hedging transactions in the amount of $0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. These amounts were offset by an increase of $0.1 million in expenses related to bank fees in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Taxes on Income

Taxes on income increased by $2.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a reversal of $2.2 million of deferred tax assets in the amount of $6.4 million recorded during fiscal year 2016. In addition, current tax expenses increased by $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of higher profitability and exhaustion of NOL carryforwards.

Net Income

As a result of the factors discussed above, net income increased by $1.2 million, or 8.2%, in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following table shows our cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the stated periods:

As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were $90.0 million. This amount does not include $115.7 million invested in available-for-sale marketable securities and $0.9 million of restricted cash (primarily held to secure bank guarantees securing office lease payments). On March 31, 2015, we consummated our initial public offering in which we sold 8,050,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $18.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $131.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and $3.6 million in offering expenses paid by us. We maintain the net proceeds received from our initial public offering as well as cash provided by operating activites in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities. We believe that cash provided by operating activities as well as our cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds from our initial public offering, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months.

Operating Activities

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $24.4 million derived mainly from a net income of $15.6 million that included $4.7 million of non-cash expenses. An increase of $5.2 million in warranty obligations, $1.9 million accruals for employees and a decrease of $13.1 million in inventories, $4.2 million in prepaid expenses and other receivables and $2.2 million in deferred tax assets which were offset by an increase of $12.1 million in trade receivables, net, and a decrease of $10.4 million in trade payables and other accounts payable.

For the three months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in operating activities was $5.9 million derived mainly from a net income of $14.4 million that included $2.6 million of non-cash expenses. An increase of $4.0 million in warranty obligations, $2.0 million in deferred revenues , $1.0 million accruals for employees and a decrease of $11.8 million in prepaid expenses and other receivables which was offset by an increase of $11.9 million in trade receivables, $6.0 million in inventories and a decrease of  $12.0 million in trade payables and other accounts payable.

Investing Activities

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $8.5 million, of which $19.9   million was invested in available-for-sale marketable securities, and $3.9   million related to capital investments in laboratory equipment, end of line testing equipment,   automated assembly lines, manufacturing tools and leasehold improvements. This was offset by $15.3 million from the maturities of available-for-sale marketable securities.

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $4.0 million, of which $3.3 million was related to capital investments in laboratory equipment, end of line testing equipment, manufacturing tools and leasehold improvements, and $0.8 million related to an investment in intangible assets. This was offset by a $0.1 million decrease in a long term lease deposit.

Financing Activities

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $273.0 thousand, all attributed to cash received from the exercise of employee and non-employee stock options.

For the three months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $17.0 thousand, all attributed to cash received from the exercise of employee and non-employee stock options.

10 

Debt Obligations

Revolving Line of Credit

In February 2015, we amended and restated a revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank ( SVB ), which permits aggregate borrowings of up to $40 million in an amount not to exceed 80% of the eligible accounts receivable and bears interest, payable monthly, at SVB s prime rate plus a margin of 0.5% to 2.0%. The revolving line of credit will terminate on December 31, 2016 and will not be extended. As of September 30, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under the  line of credit with SVB.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

ITEM 3     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, customer concentrations and interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Approximately 28.0% and 24.2% of our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were earned in non U.S. Dollar denominated currencies, principally the Euro. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, primarily the U.S. Dollar and New Israeli Shekel, and to a lesser extent the Euro. Our New Israeli Shekel denominated expenses consist primarily of personnel and overhead costs. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2016, between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar would increase or decrease our net income by $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2016, between the New Israeli Shekel and the U.S. Dollar would increase or decrease our net income by $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016.

For purposes of our consolidated financial statements, local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the U.S. Dollar on the balance sheet date and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rate as of the date of the transaction or at the average exchange rate to the U.S. Dollar during the reporting period.

To date, we have used derivative financial instruments, specifically foreign currency forward contracts, to manage exposure to foreign currency risks by hedging a portion of our account receivable balances denominated in Euros expected to be paid within nine months. Our foreign currency forward contracts are expected to mitigate exchange rate changes related to the hedged assets. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

We had cash and cash equivalents of $90.0 million and available-for-sale marketable securities with an estimated fair value of $115.7 million on September 30, 2016, which securities were held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Since most of our cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. Dollar denominated money market funds, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents do not have any material exposure to changes in exchange rates.

11 

Concentrations of Major Customers

Our trade accounts receivables potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk with our major customers. As of September 30, 2016, two major customers accounted for approximately 31.1% of our consolidated trade receivables balance. We currently do not foresee a credit risk associated with these receivables.

ITEM 4     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2016. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Based on an evaluation by our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, such officers concluded that there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In the normal course of business, we may from time to time be named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints. It is impossible to predict with certainty whether any resulting liability from any such legal claims, actions or complaints would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 1A   RISK FACTORS

There have been no material changes to  the risk factors as described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.

ITEM 2      UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

On March 25, 2015, our registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-202159) was declared effective for our initial public offering and on March 31, 2015, we consummated the initial public offering consisting of 8,050,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $18.00 per share. The offering terminated after the sale of all securities registered in the offering. Goldman, Sachs   Co. acted as joint book-running managers for the offering. Needham   Company, Canaccord Genuity Inc. and Roth Capital Partners acted as co-managers. As a result of the offering, we received total net offering proceeds of $131.2 million, after deducting total expenses of $13.7 million, consisting of underwriting discounts and commissions of $10.1 million and offering related expenses paid by us of $3.6 million. No payments for such expenses were made directly or indirectly to (i) any of our officers or directors or their associates, (ii) any persons owning 10% or more of any class of our equity securities, or (iii) any of our affiliates.

We maintain the funds received in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securitties.   Our principal uses of these proceeds from the initial public offering is general corporate purposes, including working capital and expansion of our business into additional markets. The funds have not been used to make payments directly or indirectly to (i) any of the Company s officers or directors or their associates, (ii) any persons owning 10% or more of any class of the Company s equity securities, or (iii) any of the Company s affiliates.
