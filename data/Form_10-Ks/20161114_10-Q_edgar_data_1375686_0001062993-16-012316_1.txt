Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements    (Unaudited)
   (Stated in US Dollars)    
  1. Corporate information   
 THT Heat Transfer Technology, Inc. (the  Company  or  THT  or
the  Surviving Corporation ) is a Nevada corporation with major operations in
China. 
  2. Description of business   
 The Company is a holding company whose primary business are
conducted through its subsidiaries, namely SipingJuyuan which is located in the
Jilin Province and Beijing Juyuan which is located in Beijing City of the PRC.
The Company is engaged in the manufacturing and trading of plate heat exchangers
and various related products.  
 SipingJuyuan was established in the PRC on May 31, 2006
following the division (the  Division ) of Siping City Juyuan Heat Exchange
Equipment Co., Ltd. ( Old Juyuan Company ) into three companies, namely
SipingJuyuan, Siping City Juyuan Heat Exchange Equipment Co., Ltd. ( New Juyuan
Company ) and Siping City JuyuanHanyang Pressure Vessels Co., Ltd
( JuyuanHanyang Pressure Vessels ).  
  3. Summary of significant accounting policies   
  Basis of presentation and consolidation   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of
the Company and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) including
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Certain information and note
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( U.S. GAAP ) have been or omitted from these statements pursuant to such rules
and regulations and, accordingly, they do not include all the information and
notes necessary for comprehensive consolidated financial statements and should
be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the
SEC in the Company s Form 10-K on March 30, 2016.  
 In the opinion of the management of the Company, all
adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair
statement of the results for the nine-month period have been made. Results for
the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that
might be expected for the entire fiscal year.  
 The consolidated financial statements include the financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter- company
balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.  
  Fair value of financial instruments   
 Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820 requires
the disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments including
those financial instruments for which fair value option was not elected. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amounts of the Company s
financial assets and liabilities approximated their fair values due to short
maturities or the applicable interest rates approximated the current market
rates.  
  Reclassifications   
 Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net
earnings and financial position.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements   
 In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing . The amendments in this ASU add further guidance on identifying
performance obligations and also to improve the operability and
understandability of the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do
not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date
and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective
date and transition requirements in Topic 606. Public entities should apply the
amendments for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim reporting periods therein. Early application for public
entities is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients . The amendments in this ASU, among other things: (1) clarify the
objective of the collectability criterion for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7;
(2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales
(and other similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specify that the
measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception; (4) provide a
practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of
all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period
presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance
obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction
price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify that
a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or
substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the
date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively
applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required
to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. The
effective date of these amendments is at the same date that Topic 606 is
effective. Topic 606 is effective for public entities for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods
therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments .
These amendments provide cash flow statement classification guidance for: 1.
Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; 2. Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt
Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are
Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; 3.
Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; 4. Proceeds
from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; 5. Proceeds from the Settlement of
Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned Life Insurance
Policies; 6. Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; 7. Beneficial
Interests in Securitization Transactions; and 8. Separately Identifiable Cash
Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments in this ASU
are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
application is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company
is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its
consolidated financial statements.  
 In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,  Consolidation
(Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common
Control . These amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity
is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a
reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity
treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are
under common control with the reporting entity. If a reporting entity satisfies
the first characteristic of a primary beneficiary (such that it is the single
decision maker of a variable interest entity), the amendments require that
reporting entity, in determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic
of a primary beneficiary, to include all of its direct variable interests in a
variable interest entity and, on a proportionate basis, its indirect variable
interests in a variable interest entity held through related parties, including
related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The
amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim
period. If an entity adopts the pending content that links to this paragraph in
an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of
the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently in
the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated
financial statements.

  the same period in 2015. As a percentage of sales revenue, gross profit
  increased by 16.39% to 36.66% for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
  from 20.27% for the same period in 2015.  
   
     Net income attributable to stockholders  : Net income

  Results of Operations   
  Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015   
 The following table sets forth key components of our results of
operations for the periods indicated. 
 
   Sales revenue  . Our sales revenue is generated
from sales of heat exchange products. Sales revenue decreased by $3.8 million,
or 30.03%, to $8.85 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from
$12.64 million for the same period in 2015. Our sales volume in the three months
ended September 30, 2016 amounted to 554 units, a decrease of 578 units, from
1,132 units for the same period in 2015. Such decrease was mainly due to the
decreased sales revenue from plate heat exchanger, heat exchanger unit, shell-and-tube heat
exchanger and other products in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared with the same period in 2015. Sales revenue from plate heat exchangers
decreased by $0.91 million, or 15.91%, to $4.80 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, from $5.70 million for the same period in 2015. Sales
revenue from heat exchange units decreased by $0.76 million, or 22.67%, to $2.59
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $3.35 million for
the same period in 2015. Revenue from air-cooled heat exchanger decreased by
$0.51 million, or 100%, to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
from $0.51 million for the same period in 2015. Revenue from shell-and-tube heat
exchanger decreased by $1.33 million, or 100%, to $0 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, from $1.33 million for the same period in 2015. Sales
revenue from other products decreased by $0.29 million, or 16.38% to $1.46
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $1.75 million for
the same period in 2015. The decrease was caused by decreased demand of our
products as a result of an overall slowdown in China s economy. China s economic
slowdown in the first three quarters in 2016 affected several industries we
serve, especially the emission reduction policies adopted in China, many
projects in petrochemical industry were suspended and delayed with less orders
in the first three quarters of 2016. Many orders from shipbuilding industry also
declined drastically. 
 11  

The following table shows our sales revenue by product for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 
 
   Cost of sales  . Our cost of sales is primarily
comprised of the costs of our raw materials, labor and factory overhead. Our cost of sales decreased by $4.48 million, or 44.42%, to $5.60
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $10.08 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the cost of sales was
generally in line with the decrease in our sales revenue. Cost of sales as a
percentage of sales revenue were 63.34% and 79.73% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of 16.39 percentage
points. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in the labor costs
and raw material costs.  
   Gross profit  . Our gross profit is equal to the
difference between our sales revenue and our cost of sales. Our gross profit
increased by $0.68 million, or 26.57%, to $3.24 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, from $2.56 million for the same period in 2015. The
increase in our gross profit margin was mainly attributable to the decrease in
labor costs and raw material costs as noted above. 
   Administrative expenses  . Our administrative
expenses consist of the costs associated with staff and support personnel who
manage our business activities. Our administrative expenses increased by $0.79
million, or 93.55%%, to $1.64 million for the three months ended September 30,
2016, from $0.85 million for the same period in 2015. As a percentage of sales
revenue, administrative expenses increased to 18.58% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, as compared to 6.72% for the same period in 2015. The
increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to the recognition of more
bad debt expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as the economy
became worse for the industry. The increase due to bad debt recognition was
offset by a decrease of wage expenses, as we have laid off some employees during
the period.  
   Research and development expenses  .  
  Our research and development expenses consist of the costs associated
with research and development personnel and expense in research and development
projects. Our research and development expenses increased by $0.15 million, or
33.32%, to $0.61 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from
$0.46 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in research and
development expenses was mainly attributable to more new products in the process
of research and development during the three months period ended September 30,
2016.  
   Selling expenses  . Our selling expenses include
sales commissions, the cost of advertising and promotional materials, salaries
and fringe benefits of sales personnel, after-sale support services and other
sales-related costs. Our selling expenses decreased by $0.29 million, or 26.64%%, to $0.79 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $1.08 million for the same
period in 2015. As a percentage of sales revenue, selling expenses increased to
8.97% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 8.56% for
the same period in 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to the Company s
decrease in involvement of market expansion in three month ended September 30,
2016, as much expansion effort was made in the same period in 2015.  
 12  

Income before income taxes.   Income before income
taxes decreased by $83,000, or 4.28%, to $0.116 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, from $0.125 million for the same period in 2015. Such
decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in sales revenue.  
   Income tax benefit  .     Our income tax
benefit increased by $0.019 million, or 516.14%, to $0.023 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, from $40,000 for the same period in 2015, as a
result of the increased net loss before income tax.  
   Net income attributable to common
stockholders  .   As a result of the cumulative effect of the
foregoing factors, our net income attributable to common stockholders increased
by $0.01 million, or 8.76%, to $0.14 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, from $0.13 million for the same period in 2015. As a
percentage of sales revenue, our net income attributable to common stockholders
was 1.58% and 1.02% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 
  Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2015   
 The following table sets forth key components of our results of
operations for the periods indicated. 
 
   Sales revenue  . Our sales revenue decreased by
$7.18 million, or 25.70%, to $20.76 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, from $27.95 million for the same period in 2015. Our sales volume in
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to 1,389 units, a decrease of
594 units, from 1,983 units for the same period in 2015. Such decrease was
mainly due to decreased demand of our products in consequence of less projects
and economic slowdown in the first three quarters of 2016 compared with the same
period in 2015.  
 The following table shows our sales revenue by product for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 
 13  

Cost of sales  . Our cost of sales decreased by
$8.09 million, or 38.25%, to $13.07 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, from $21.16 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
decrease in the cost of sales was generally in line with the decrease in our
sales revenue. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue were 62.93% and
75.72% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an
decrease of 12.79 percentage points. The decrease was mainly attributable to the
decrease in labor costs and raw material costs.  
   Gross profit  . Our gross profit increased by $0.91
million, or 13.42%, to $7.70 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, from $6.79 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in our gross
profit was mainly attributable to the decrease in cost of sales noted above. 
   Administrative expenses  . Our administrative
expenses increased by $2.27 million, or 121.05%, to $4.15 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, from $1.88 million for the same period in 2015.
As a percentage of sales revenue, administrative expenses increased to 20.01%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 6.72% for the same
period in 2015. The increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to the
following reasons: (1) bad debt expense increased resulting from the increase of
uncollected accounts receivable with the slowdown of economy and (2) other
general and administrative expenses, such as SAP system installation fees,
increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   Research and development expenses  .  
  Our research and development expenses decreased by $0.03 million, or
2.31%, to $1.14 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $1.17
million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in research and development
expenses was mainly attributable to fewer new products in the process of
research and development.  
   Selling expenses  . Our selling expenses increased
by $1.68 million, or 59.52%, to $4.50 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, from $2.82 million for the same period in 2015. As a
percentage of sales revenue, selling expenses increased to 21.66% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 10.09% for the same period in
2015. The increase was mainly attributable to the Company s efforts to develop
new customers during the nine month ended September 30, 2016, especially in the
first half of 2016. 
   Income (loss) before income taxes  . Income before
income taxes decreased by $3.01 million, or 331.33%, to a loss of $2.10 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from an income of $0.91 million
for the same period in 2015. Such decrease was mainly attributable to decrease
in sales revenues and increased total expenses.  
   Income tax benefit (expense)  .     Our
income taxes benefit increased by $0.41 million, or 296.44%, to $0.27 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $0.14 million income tax
expense for the same period in 2015, as a result of decreased taxable income.
 
   Net income (loss) attributable to common
stockholders  .   As a result of the cumulative effect of the
foregoing factors, our net income decreased by $2.60 million, or 337.67%, to
$1.83 million net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $0.77
million net income for the same period in 2015. As a percentage of sales
revenue, our net income attributable to common stockholders was -8.80% and 2.75%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 14  

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of
$5.02 million, primarily consisting of cash on hand and demand deposits. We
anticipate that cash on hand will be sufficient to satisfy our ongoing
obligations.  
 We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate.
We have an installment payment arrangement with our customers. The current
economic slowdown and China s tightened credit policy led to delayed payments
and delayed delivery schedules by our customers, which in turn caused us to
increase our allowance for doubtful accounts from a reversal of allowance of
$-0.09 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $0.50 million in
the same period in 2016. To control inflation after a massive stimulus plan, the
Chinese government tightened its credit policy. As a result, state-owned banks
limited their lending to large state-owned corporations and privately held
companies continue to have difficulty accessing capital. Most of our customers
have been affected by the tightened credit policy and have limited access to
capital. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts at a rate of 25%
for receivables aged between 1 to 2 years, 50% for receivables aged between 2 to
3 years and 100% for receivables aged over 3 years.  
 Our allowance of obsolete inventory is also appropriate because
we purchase raw materials after we receive purchase orders. Although our
customers may delay their payment or delivery schedules, which increase our
inventories, they do not cancel their orders so as to cause us to classify the
delayed inventories as obsolete inventories.  
 We expect that the trend of delayed customer payments and
delayed delivery schedules will continue in the future. We have been taking the
following measures to mitigate the situation: 1) send the collection letters or
call the customers to request payment; 2) appoint specialists to visit our
customers to collect payment; 3) file law suits.  
 PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC
subsidiaries only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined
in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC
subsidiaries are also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at
least 10% of their annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC
GAAP to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches
50% of our registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can
only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of
loans, advances, or cash dividends. Given that the Company and the PRC
subsidiaries do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, we
consider the impact of restrictions on our liquidity, financial condition and
results of operations is not significant.  
 The following table provides a summary of our net cash flows
from operating, investing, and financing activities. 
  Cash Flow  
 
   Operating Activities    
 Net cash used in operating activities was $2.06 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $5.63 million for the same
period in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was mainly
attributable to the increase in cash inflow from allowance for doubtful accounts
of $1.87 million, from net trade receivable of $2.15 million, from accounts
payable, and other payables and accrued expenses of $7.42 million and $7.68
million, respectively. Such increase in cash inflow is then offset by increase
in cash outflow from net loss of $2.60 million, from bills receivable of $1.63
million, and from net inventories of $11.60 million.  
 15  

Investing Activities    
 Net cash used in investing activities was $1.14 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with net cash provided in
investing activities of $0.24 million in the same period in 2015. The net cash
used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
primarily used for loan made to third party, payment to acquire property, plant
and equipment, payment for construction in progress, and use of restricted
cash. 
   Financing Activities    
 Net cash used in financing activities was $1.26 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with net cash provided by
financing activities of $1.14 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease
in net cash used in financing activities resulted from repayment of short-term
loans in the amount of $14.01 million and repayment to related parties in the
amount of $0.76 million, offset by proceeds from short-term loans in the amount
of $12.78 million and that from related party of $0.046 million. 
   Capital Expenditures   
 Our capital expenditures were used primarily for the purchase
of equipment to expand our production capacity and deposits for land use
rights. 
 
 We estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal year
2016 will reach approximately $0.85 million to buy the equipment for necessary
products used in the nuclear power industry.  
  Seasonality   
 Our operating results and operating cash flows historically
have been subject to seasonal variations. Our revenues usually increase over
each quarter of the calendar year with the first quarter usually the slowest
quarter because fewer projects are undertaken during and around the Chinese
spring festival.    
  Inflation   
 Inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on
our business, and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will
materially affect our business in the foreseeable future. However, our
management will closely monitor price changes in the Chinese economy and our
industry and continually maintain effective cost controls in operations. 
  
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity or capital expenditures, or capital resources that are
material to an investment in our securities.  
  Critical Accounting Policies  
 Critical accounting policies are those we believe are most
important to portraying our financial conditions and results of operations and
also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by
management. Judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these
policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various
conditions or using different assumptions.   See Note 3 to our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
report.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   
 Not Applicable.  
  ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer
to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(e), our management has carried out
an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our Chief
Executive Officer, Mr. Guohong Zhao, and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Mr.
Zhigang Xu, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2016. Based upon, and as of the
date of this evaluation, Messrs. Zhao and Xu determined that because of the
material weaknesses described in Item 9A  Controls and Procedures  of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which we are still in
the process of remediating as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective. Investors are directed to Item 9A of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for the description of
these weaknesses. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
  
 We regularly review our system of internal control over
financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve
controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective
internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as
implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and
migrating processes.  
 During its evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, our management identified
material weakness related to our lack of: (1) sufficient and adequately trained
accounting and finance personnel; (2) qualified resources to perform the
internal audit functions properly; and (3) an internal audit department which
renders ineffective our ability to prevent and detect control lapses and errors
in the accounting of certain key areas. As disclosed in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our management has identified
the steps necessary to address the material weaknesses, and in the third quarter
of 2015, we continued to implement these remedial procedures. 
 Other than in connection with the implementation of the
remedial measures described above, there were no changes in our internal
controls over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2015 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.  
 17  

PART II     OTHER INFORMATION      
  ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   
 From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits
and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these,
or other matters, may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are
currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will
have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition
or operating results.
