1)   
        Business
    Overview, Liquidity and Management Plans     

Pressure
BioSciences, Inc. ( we ,  our ,  the Company ) is focused on solving the challenging problems
inherent in biological sample preparation, a crucial laboratory step performed by scientists worldwide working in biological life
sciences research. Sample preparation is a term that refers to a wide range of activities that precede most forms of scientific
analysis. Sample preparation is often complex, time-consuming and, in our belief, one of the most error-prone steps of scientific
research. It is a widely-used laboratory undertaking   the requirements of which drive what we believe is a large and growing
worldwide market. We have developed and patented a novel, enabling technology platform that can control the sample preparation
process. It is based on harnessing the unique properties of high hydrostatic pressure. This process, called pressure cycling technology,
or PCT, uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels i.e., 35,000 pounds per square inch
(  psi  ) or greater to safely, conveniently and reproducibly control the actions of molecules in biological
samples, such as cells and tissues from human, animal, plant and microbial sources.  

Our
pressure cycling technology uses internally developed instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and
ultra-high levels at controlled temperatures and specific time intervals, to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of
bio-molecules, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (  DNA  ), ribonucleic acid (  RNA  ), proteins,
lipids and small molecules. Our laboratory instrument, the Barocycler   , and our internally developed consumables
product line, which include our Pressure Used to Lyse Samples for Extraction (  PULSE  ) tubes, and other processing
tubes, and application specific kits such as consumable products and reagents, together make up our PCT Sample Preparation System
(  PCT SPS  ).  

In
2015, together with an investment bank, we formed a subsidiary called Pressure BioSciences Europe ( PBI Europe ) in
Poland. We have 49% ownership interest with the investment bank retaining 51%. As of now, PBI Europe does not have any operating
activities but is expected to commence operations in 2017. Therefore, we don t have control of the subsidiary and did not
consolidate in our financial statements.  

2)   
        Going
    Concern     

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, we have experienced negative
cash flows from operations with respect to our pressure cycling technology business since our inception. As of September 30, 2016,
we do not have adequate working capital resources to satisfy our current liabilities and as a result, there is substantial doubt
regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We have been successful in raising cash through debt and equity offerings
in the past and as described in Note 6, we completed an over-subscribed $5.0 million debt financing on March 31, 2016 with a total
amount raised of $6.3 million. We have financing efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and equity offerings.  

Management has developed
a plan to continue operations. This plan includes obtaining equity or debt financing. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016 we received $3,447,166 net proceeds, in additional convertible, non-convertible debt and shares of common stock. Although
we have successfully completed financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these
matters in the future will be successful. 

We
need substantial additional capital to fund normal operations in future periods. In the event that we are unable to obtain financing
on acceptable terms, or at all, we will likely be required to cease our operations, pursue a plan to sell our operating assets,
or otherwise modify our business strategy, which could materially harm our future business prospects. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.  

3)   
        Interim
    Financial Reporting     

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which was derived from audited financial
statements, and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Pressure BioSciences, Inc. have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( generally accepted accounting
principles  or  GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
all material adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
included. Operating results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the audited consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K (the  Form 10-K )
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 5, 2016.  

4)   
        Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies     

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pressure BioSciences, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary
PBI BioSeq, Inc. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
amounts in the 2015 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.  

Use
of Estimates   

To
prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, we are required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In addition, significant estimates were made in projecting future cash flows
to quantify deferred tax assets, the costs associated with fulfilling our warranty obligations for the instruments that we sell,
and the estimates employed in our calculation of fair value of stock options awarded and warrant derivative liability. We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.  

Concentrations   

Credit
Risk   

Our
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents,
and trade receivables. We have cash investment policies which, among other things, limit investments to investment-grade securities.
We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, and the risk with respect to trade receivables is further mitigated by
the fact that many of our customers are government institutions, large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic
laboratories.  

The
following table illustrates the level of concentration as a percentage of total revenues during the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

The
following table illustrates the level of concentration as a percentage of net accounts receivable balance as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Product
Supply   

A
Massachusetts-based contract manufacturer started building the new NEP2320 Extreme Barocycler instrument in May 2016. We plan
to have this manufacturer build all instruments in the future.  

Investment
in Available-For-Sale Equity Securities   

As of September 30, 2016,
we held 601,500 shares of common stock of Everest Investments Holdings S.A. ( Everest ), a Polish publicly traded
company listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. We account for this investment in accordance with ASC 320   Investments  
Debt and Equity Securities   as securities available for sale. On September 30, 2016, our condensed consolidated balance
sheet reflected the fair value of our investment in Everest to be $59,550, based on the closing price of Everest shares of $0.10
per share on that day. The carrying value of our investment in Everest common stock held will change from period to period based
on the closing price of the common stock of Everest as of the balance sheet date. This change in market value will be recorded
by us on a quarterly basis as an unrealized gain or loss in Comprehensive Income or Loss. 

Inventories   

Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost (average cost) or market (sales price). The cost of Barocyclers consists of the cost charged by
the contract manufacturer. The cost of manufactured goods includes material, freight-in, direct labor, and applicable overhead.
The composition of inventory is as follows:  

Debt
Issuance Costs   

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ). ASU 2015-03 requires
that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent
with the presentation of debt discounts. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were required to be presented
as deferred charge assets, separate from the related debt liability. ASU 2015-03 does not change the recognition and measurement
requirements for debt issuance costs. The Company early-adopted ASU 2015-03 as of the end of its Fiscal 2015, and applied its
provisions retrospectively.  

Computation
of Loss per Share   

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been
issued. For purposes of this calculation, convertible preferred stock, common stock dividends, and warrants and options to acquire
common stock, are all considered common stock equivalents in periods in which they have a dilutive effect and are excluded from
this calculation in periods in which these are anti-dilutive to our net loss.  

The
following table illustrates our computation of loss per share for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015:  

The
following table presents securities that could potentially dilute basic loss per share in the future. For all periods presented,
the potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because these securities would
have been anti-dilutive to our net loss. The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, Series G Convertible Preferred Stock, Series
H Convertible Preferred Stock, Series J Convertible Preferred Stock and Series K Convertible Preferred Stock are presented below
as if they were converted into common shares according to the conversion terms.  

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Expense   

We
maintain equity compensation plans under which incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options are granted to employees,
independent members of our Board of Directors and outside consultants. We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the
requisite service period using the Black-Scholes formula to estimate the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant.  

Determining
Fair Value of Stock Option Grants   

Valuation
and Amortization Method - The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing
model based on certain assumptions. The estimated fair value of employee stock options is amortized to expense using the straight-line
method over the vesting period.  

Expected
Term - The Company uses the simplified calculation of expected life, as the Company does not currently have sufficient historical
exercise data on which to base an estimate of expected term. Using this method, the expected term is determined using the average
of the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options granted.  

Expected
Volatility - Expected volatility is based on the Company s historical stock volatility data over the expected term of the
award.  

Risk-Free
Interest Rate - The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield
currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.  

Forfeitures
The Company records stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. The Company estimated
a forfeiture rate of 5% for awards granted based on historical experience and future expectations of options vesting. The Company
used this historical rate as our assumption in calculating future stock-based compensation expense.  

The
Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $90,500 and $74,864 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The following table summarizes the effect of this stock-based compensation expense within each of the line items
of our costs and expenses within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:  

The
Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $282,811 and $185,370 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. The following table summarizes the effect of this stock-based compensation expense within each of the line
items of our costs and expenses within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Due
to their short maturities, the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued
expenses approximate their fair value. Long-term liabilities are primarily related to convertible debentures and deferred revenue
with carrying values that approximate fair value.  

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820 )
as it related to all financial assets and financial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis.  

The
Company generally defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The Company uses a three-tier fair value
hierarchy, which classifies the inputs used in measuring fair values. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs
such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active
markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market
data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.  

Financial
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. The Company has determined that its financial assets are classified within Level 1 and its financial liabilities
are currently classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The development of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair
value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company s management.  

The
following tables set forth the Company s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring
basis as of September 30, 2016:  

The
following table provides a summary of the changes in fair value, including net transfers in and/or out, of the derivative financial
instruments, measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs for the nine months ended September
30, 2016:  

The
amounts above valued at issuance includes $1,337,510 that was charged directly to  change in fair value of derivative liabilities 
at issuance.  

The
following tables set forth the Company s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring
basis as of December 31, 2015:

        Commitments
    and Contingencies     

Operating
Leases   

Our
corporate offices are currently located at 14 Norfolk Avenue, South Easton, Massachusetts 02375. We are currently paying $4,800
per month, on a lease extension, signed on December 29, 2015, that expires December 31, 2016, for our corporate office.  

On
November 1, 2014 we signed a lease for lab space in Medford, MA. We subsequently expanded our space in Medford. The lease expires
December 30, 2017 and requires monthly payments of $5,385 subject to annual cost of living increases.  

Rental
costs are expensed as incurred. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred $108,038 and $73,775 in rent
expense, respectively for the use of our corporate office and research and development facilities.  

Government
Grants   

We
have received a $1.05 million NIH SBIR Phase II Grant. Under the grant, the NIH has committed to pay the Company to develop a
high-throughput, high pressure-based DNA Shearing System for Next Generation Sequencing and other genomic applications. The grant
terminates in November 2017.

entered into Subscription Agreements (the   Subscription Agreement  ) with various individuals (each, a   Purchaser  )
between July 23, 2015 and March 31, 2016, pursuant to which the Company sold Senior Secured Convertible Debentures (the   Debentures  )
and warrants to purchase shares of common stock equal to 50% of the number of shares issuable pursuant to the subscription amount
(the   Warrants  ) for an aggregate purchase price of $6,329,549 (the   Purchase Price  ).  

The
Company issued a principal aggregate amount of $6,962,504 in Debentures which includes a 10% original issue discount on the Purchase
Price. The Debenture does not accrue any additional interest during the first year it is outstanding but accrues interest at a
rate equal to 10% per annum for the second year it is outstanding. The Debenture has a maturity date of two years from issuance.
The Debenture is convertible any time after its issuance date. The Purchaser has the right to convert the Debenture into shares
of the Company s common stock at a fixed conversion price equal to $0.28 per share, subject to applicable adjustments. In
the second year that the Debenture is outstanding, any interest accrued shall be payable quarterly in either cash or common stock,
at the Company s discretion.  

At
any time after the Issuance Date, the Company has the option, subject to certain conditions, to redeem some or all of the then
outstanding principal amount of the Debenture for cash in an amount equal to the sum of (i) 120% of the then outstanding principal
amount of the Debenture, (ii) accrued but unpaid interest and (iii) any liquidated damages and other amounts due in respect of
the Debenture.  

The
Company issued warrants exercisable into a total of 11,302,766 shares of our common stock. The Warrants issued in this transaction
are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $0.40 per share, subject to applicable adjustments including full ratchet
anti-dilution in the event that we issue any securities at a price lower than the exercise price then in effect. The Warrants
have an expiration period of five years from the original issue date. The Warrants are subject to adjustment for stock splits,
stock dividends or recapitalizations and also include anti-dilution price protection for subsequent equity sales below the exercise
price.  

Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Warrants, at any time commencing six months from the Final Closing, the Company has the right
to call the Warrants for cancellation if the volume weighted average price of its Common Stock on the OTC QB Market (or other
primary trading market or exchange on which the Common Stock is then traded) equals or exceeds three times the per share exercise
price of the Warrants for 15 out of 20 consecutive trading days.  

In
connection with the Subscription Agreement and Debenture, the Company entered into Security Agreements with the Purchasers whereby
the Company agreed to grant to Purchasers an unconditional and continuing, first priority security interest in all of the assets
and property of the Company to secure the prompt payment, performance and discharge in full of all of Company s obligations
under the Debentures, Warrants and the other Transaction Documents.  

The
Company determined that the conversion feature of the Debentures met the definition of a liability in accordance with ASC 815-40
and therefore bifurcated the conversion feature on each debt agreement and accounted for it as a derivative liability. The fair
value of the conversion feature was accounted for as a note discount and are amortized to interest expense over the life of the
loan. The fair value of the conversion feature was reflected in the conversion option liability line in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets.  

The
proceeds from these convertible debts were allocated between the host debt instrument and the convertible option based on the
residual method. The estimated fair value of the convertible option was determined using a binomial formula, resulting in allocations
to the convertible option and accounted for as a liability in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet. In accordance
with the provisions of ASC 815-40, the gross proceeds are offset by debt discounts, which are amortized to interest expense over
the expected life of the debt.  

ASC
470-20 states that the proceeds from the issuance of debt with detachable stock warrants should be allocated between the debt
and warrants on the basis of their relative fair market values. The debt discount will be amortized to interest expense over the
two year term of these loans. We amortized $2,768,527 of the debt discount to interest expense in 2016. The warrants issued in
connection with the convertible debentures are classified as warrant derivative liabilities because the warrants are entitled
to certain rights in subsequent financings and the warrants contain  down-round protection  and therefore, do not
meet the scope exception for treatment as a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, ( ASC 815 ). Since
 down-round protection  is not an input into the calculation of the fair value of the warrants, the warrants cannot
be considered indexed to the Company s own stock which is a requirement for the scope exception as outlined under ASC 815.
The estimated fair value of the warrants was determined using the binomial model, resulting in an allocation of $2,847,624 to
the total warrants out of the gross proceeds of $6,329,549. The fair value will be affected by changes in inputs to that model
including our stock price, expected stock price volatility, the contractual term, and the risk-free interest rate. We will continue
to classify the fair value of the warrants as a liability until the warrants are exercised, expire or are amended in a way that
would no longer require these warrants to be classified as a liability, whichever comes first.  

Other
convertible notes   

On
May 13, 2016, one lender converted an outstanding note issued on April 28, 2015 and the related accrued interest totaling $117,837
to 420,849 common shares. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance on the note was zero.  

On
May 24, we sold an additional convertible note for $107,000 with warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $0.55 per share. The purchaser has the right to convert the notes into shares of the Company s common stock at
a fixed conversion price equal to $0.45 per share, subject to applicable adjustments. The estimated fair value of the warrants
was determined using the binomial model, resulting in an allocation of $12,406 to the total warrants and the recognition of a
beneficial conversion feature of $7,962, both of which were recorded as a discount to the note. We evaluated the convertible note
and warrants for derivative liability treatment and determined that these instruments do not include certain rights such as price
protection like our previous debt financings. Accordingly, we concluded that this financing arrangement did not qualify for derivative
accounting treatment.  

On
June 14, 2016, we sold an additional convertible note for $115,000 and issued 30,667 common shares to compensate the lender. On
July 1, 2016, the note was modified to increase the principal amount to $200,000 and we received the remaining proceeds of $85,000
on the same date and issued 34,333 common shares as compensation to the lender. The lender has the right to convert the note into
shares of the Company s common stock at fixed conversion price equal to $0.45 per share, subject to applicable adjustments.
We valued the total 65,000 common shares using the stock prices at the respective dates the note proceeds were received and recorded
the relative fair value of the shares amounting to $26,000 as a debt discount to be amortized over the term of the loan. We then
computed the effective conversion price of the note, noting that no beneficial conversion feature exists. We also evaluated the
convertible note for derivative liability treatment and determined that the instrument does not include certain rights such as
price protection like our previous debt financing. Accordingly, we concluded that this financing arrangement did not qualify for
derivative accounting treatment.  

On
July 29, 2016, we sold an additional convertible note for $100,000 and issued 32,500 common shares to compensate the lender. The
lender has the right to convert the notes into shares of the Company s common stock at a fixed conversion price equal to
$0.45 per share, subject to applicable adjustments. The proceeds were allocated between the convertible note and shares of common
stock based on their relative fair values. The relative fair values of the convertible note and the common shares was $87,241
and $12,759, respectively. We then computed the effective conversion price of the note, noting that the convertible debt gave
rise to a beneficial conversion feature (BCF) of $12,759. The sum of the relative fair value of the common shares and the BCF
of $25,518 was recorded as a debt discount to be amortized over the term of the loan. We also evaluated the convertible note for
derivative liability treatment and determined that the instruments does not include certain rights such as price protection like
our previous debt financings. Accordingly, we concluded that this financing arrangements did not qualify for derivative accounting
treatment.  

On September 15, 2016,
we sold an additional convertible note for $500,000 and issued 200,000 common shares to compensate the lender. The lender has
the right to convert the notes into shares of the Company s common stock at a fixed conversion price equal to $0.45 per
share, subject to applicable adjustments. The convertible note includes an original issue discount of $40,541 and is subject to
annual interest of 9%. The proceeds were allocated between the convertible note and shares of common stock based on their relative
fair values. The relative fair value of the convertible note was $434,028. The allocation of the gross proceeds to the shares
of common stock was $65,972 and recorded as a debt discount to be amortized over the term of the loan. We then computed the effective
conversion price of the note, noting that no beneficial conversion feature exists. We also evaluated the convertible note for
derivative liability treatment and determined that the instrument does not include certain rights such as price protection like
our previous debt financings. Accordingly, we concluded that this financing arrangement did not qualify for derivative accounting
treatment.

Other
Notes   

On January 6, 2016 we
signed a Merchant Agreement with a lender. Under the agreement we received $250,000 in exchange for rights to all customer receipts
until the lender is paid $322,500, which is collected at the rate of $1,280 per business day. The payments were secured by second
position rights to all customer receipts until the loan has been paid in full. $138,840 of the proceeds were used to pay off the
outstanding balance of a previous loan from another lender. The Company recognized a gain on the settlement of the previous loan
of $5,044 which was credited to interest expense. The Company paid $2,500 in fees in connection with this loan. We received an
additional $93,161 in June 2016 under the existing Merchant Agreement. The note was still outstanding as of September 30, 2016
with a balance of $105,125.

January 20, 2016, we borrowed $50,000 from an individual with no interest or fees. We paid back the loan in March 2016.  

On February 8, 2016 we
signed a Merchant Agreement with a lender. Under the agreement we received $100,000 in exchange for third position rights to all
customer receipts until the lender is paid $129,900, which is collected at the rate of $927 per business day. The Company paid
$2,000 in fees in connection with this loan. We received an additional $125,000 in June 2016 under the existing Merchant Agreement
of which $48,420 was used to pay off the prior loan. The note was still outstanding as of September 30, 2016 with a balance of

On May 9, 2016 we signed
a promissory note with a lender. Under the agreement we received $200,000 net of a $6,000 original issue discount and we repaid
$206,000 on August 25, 2016. In connection with this promissory note, we issued warrants exercisable into 100,000 shares of our
common stock. The warrants issued in this transaction are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $0.55 per share. The
warrants have an expiration period of three years from the original issue date. The warrants are subject to adjustment for stock
splits, stock dividends or recapitalizations. The warrants were recorded as a component of our Stockholders  Equity. The
estimated fair value of the warrants was determined using the binomial model, resulting in an allocation of $27,349 to the total
warrants and recorded as a discount to the note to be amortized over the term of the loan. We evaluated the warrants for derivative
liability treatment and determined that these instruments do not include certain rights such as price protection like our previous
debt financings. Accordingly, we concluded that these instruments did not qualify for derivative accounting treatment. In August
2016, the lender extended the maturity date of the note from August 11, 2016 to August 25, 2016. Consequently, a penalty interest
of $41,200 was added to the principal amount and settled through the issuance of 100,049 common shares. As of September 30, 2016,
the outstanding balance on this note was zero.

into as of August 29, 2016. The investors received warrants to purchase 1,125,000 shares of the Company s common stock at
$0.50 exercise price. The warrants expire 5 years after issuance. We also incurred stock issuance costs related to broker and
legal fees of $67,035 which were charged to additional paid in capital.  

8)   
        Subsequent
    Events     

On
October 11 and November 10, 2016, we completed two additional tranches of the Fall 2016 Private Placement, pursuant to which we
sold an aggregate of 400,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, for a purchase price of $0.40 per share, resulting in gross
proceeds to us of approximately $160,000. The Shares were issued and sold to a total of 2 accredited investors pursuant to a Securities
Purchase Agreement entered into as of the date of their investments. The investors received warrants to purchase a total of 400,000
shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.50. The warrants expire 5 years after issuance.  

On
October 28, 2016, an accredited investor (the  Investor ) purchased a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount
of up to $2,000,000 (the  Note ) due and payable on the earlier of October 28, 2017 or on the seventh business day
after the closing of a Qualified Offering (as defined in the Note). Although the Note is dated October 26, 2016, the transaction
did not close until October 28, 2016, when the Company received its initial $250,000 advance pursuant to the Note. As a result,
on the same day and pursuant to the Note, the Company issued to the Investor a Common Stock Purchase Warrant to purchase 625,000
shares of the Company s common stock ( Common Stock ) at an exercise price per share equal to $0.40 per share.
The Investor is obligated to provide the Company $250,000 advances under the Note, but the Investor shall not be required to advance
more than $250,000 in any individual fifteen (15) day period and no more than $500,000 in the thirty (30) day period immediately
following the date of the initial advance. Notwithstanding the fifteen (15) day period limitation, on November 2, 2016, the Company
received a second $250,000 advance pursuant to the Note and the Company issued to the Investor the second warrant to purchase
625,000 shares of the Common Stock. The terms of the first and second warrants are identical except for the exercise date, issue
date, and termination date. Interest on the principal balance of the Note shall be paid in full on the Maturity Date, unless otherwise
paid prior to the Maturity Date. Interest shall be assessed as follows: (i) 10% on all principal amounts advanced prior to April
28, 2017; (ii) the foregoing and 4% on any amount remaining outstanding if the principal amount is repaid between April 28, 2017
and July28, 2017; or (iii) both of the foregoing and 4% on any amount remaining outstanding if the principal amount is repaid
between July 28, 2017 and October 28, 2017. Our placement agent is being paid eight percent (8%) of all principal amounts advanced
in connection with this transaction.   

On
November 1, 2016, we signed a consulting agreement with an investor relations firm for a twelve month period with a six-month
cancellation clause. In connection with this agreement, we issued a warrant exercisable at $0.40 per share for 660,000 shares
of our common stock. Of these shares, 330,000 vest immediately and 330,000 shares vest 181 days after November 1, 2016. The warrant
expires five years from issuance.

OVERVIEW    

We
are focused on solving the challenging problems inherent in biological sample preparation, a crucial laboratory step performed
by scientists worldwide working in biological life sciences research. Sample preparation is a term that refers to a wide range
of activities that precede most forms of scientific analysis. Sample preparation is often complex, time-consuming and, in our
belief, one of the most error-prone steps of scientific research. It is a widely-used laboratory undertaking   the requirements
of which drive what we believe is a large and growing worldwide market. We have developed and patented a novel, enabling technology
platform that can control the sample preparation process. It is based on harnessing the unique properties of high hydrostatic
pressure. This process, called PCT, uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels i.e.,
45,000 pounds per square inch ( psi ) or greater to safely, conveniently and reproducibly control the actions of molecules
in biological samples, such as cells and tissues from human, animal, plant and microbial sources.  

Our
pressure cycling technology uses internally developed instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and
ultra-high levels at controlled temperatures and specific time intervals, to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of
bio-molecules, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (  DNA  ), ribonucleic acid (  RNA  ), proteins,
lipids and small molecules. Our laboratory instrument, the Barocycler   , and our internally developed consumables
product line, which include our Pressure Used to Lyse Samples for Extraction (  PULSE  ) tubes, and other processing
tubes, and application specific kits such as consumable products and reagents, together make up our PCT Sample Preparation System
(  PCT SPS  ).  

We
have experienced negative cash flows from operations with respect to our pressure cycling technology business since our inception.
As of September 30, 2016, we did not have adequate working capital resources to satisfy our current liabilities and as a result
we have substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current projections, including equity
financing subsequent to September 30, 2016, we believe we will have the cash resources that will enable us to continue to fund
normal operations into the foreseeable future.  

We
need substantial additional capital to fund normal operations in future periods. If we are able to obtain additional capital or
otherwise increase our revenues, we may increase spending in specific research and development applications and engineering projects
and may hire additional sales personnel or invest in targeted marketing programs. In the event that we are unable to obtain financing
on acceptable terms, or at all, we will likely be required to cease our operations, pursue a plan to sell our operating assets,
or otherwise modify our business strategy, which could materially harm our future business prospects.  

We
hold 14 United States and 10 foreign patents covering multiple applications of PCT in the life sciences field. Our pressure cycling
technology employs a unique approach that we believe has the potential for broad use in a number of established and emerging life
sciences areas, including;  

sample
    preparation for genomic, proteomic, and small molecule studies;   

pathogen
    inactivation;   

protein
    purification;   

control
    of chemical (particularly enzymatic) reactions; and   

immunodiagnostics
    (clinical laboratory testing).   

We
reported a number of accomplishments in the first nine months of 2016:  

On
January 12, 2016 SCIEX, a global leader in life science analytical technologies (Framingham, MA) and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR), announced an exclusive co-marketing agreement with PBI to improve protein quantification in
complex samples.  

On
January 28, 2016 in a report focused on the exclusive co-marketing agreement between SCIEX and PBI, Emerging Growth LLC indicated
the combination of the two company s technologies could result in superior biological insights and discoveries and in rapid
and dramatic revenue growth for PBI.  

On
February 3, 2016 SCIEX and Children s Medical Research Institute (Sydney, Australia) announced they had joined forces to
advance the promise of precision medicine. The partners stated they would benefit from SCIEX s exclusive collaborators,
including Pressure BioSciences, and PBI s PCT platform for increased protein quantitation and reproducibility.  

On
March 14, 2016 the Company announced that we would participate in a SCIEX workshop on new innovations towards industrialized proteomics
at the US HUPO scientific conference in Boston.  

On
April 12, 2016, the Company announced that we had been added to the high-performing Richmond Club Index. The Richmond Index has
outperformed the S P 500 Index by an average of 11% each year for the past ten years.  

On
July 13, 2016, the Company announced the unveiling of the newest addition to our product line based on their patented and powerful
PCT platform, the Barocycler 2320EXTREME ( 2320EXT ). The product unveiling took place during the recent annual conference
of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry ( ASMS ) in San Antonio, Texas.  

On
July 21, 2016, the Company announced the initial shipment of our Barocycler 2320EXTREME instrument to an Australian cancer research
group (ProCan) named by the White House as a collaborator in the U.S. s  Cancer Moonshot  initiative.  

On
October 26, 2016, the Company announced its featured participation in the recent opening of The ACRF International Centre for
the Proteome of Human Cancer located in newly renovated laboratory facilities at the Children s Medical Research Institute
near Sydney, Australia.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenue   

We
recognized total revenue of $535,334 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $580,334 during the three months
ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $45,000 or 8%. This decrease is solely attributable to decreases in grant related activities
and technical support services as detailed below.  

Products,
Services, Other . Revenue from the sale of products and services increased 4% to $500,949 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to $481,452 during the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to
the launch of the Barocycler 2320 Extreme pressure-based instrument systems. Sales of consumables also increased for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 to $32,811 compared to $28,339 during the same period in the prior year, an increase of 16%.  

Grant
Revenue . During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded grant revenue of $34,385 compared to grant revenue
of $98,882 in the comparable period in 2015. Work on the $1.05 million NIH grant decreased during the third quarter as we continued
to wait for certain significant parts to be manufactured. These parts were received during the second quarter of 2016, and are
currently being put through our quality control procedures. Once released from quality control, the availability of these parts
should result in an increase in grant work in future periods.  

Cost
of Products and Services   

The
cost of products and services was $262,894 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $209,804 for the comparable
period in 2015. Gross profit margin on products and services was 47% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to 56% for the prior period. Cost of products increased and gross profit margin decreased because we sold several of our new Barocycler
2320EXTREME units during the quarter and the cost to manufacture these units was higher than expected because of start-up costs
related to the initial manufacture of these systems. We expect the cost to manufacture these units will decrease and the sales
price to increase in the coming quarters..  

Research
and Development   

Research
and development expenditures were $268,317 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $355,574 in the same
period in 2015, a decrease of $87,257 or 25%. The prior period included the cost of research performed by a customer on our behalf.  

Research
and development expense recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included $14,735 and $18,307 of non-cash,
stock-based compensation expense, respectively.  

Selling
and Marketing   

Selling
and marketing expenses increased to $224,380 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $207,888 for the comparable period
in 2015, an increase of $16,492 or 8%. This increase was due to commissions paid to our sales person and the cost of part-time
help over the summer months in 2016.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, selling and marketing expense included $9,911 and $13,310 of non-cash, stock-based
compensation expense, respectively.  

General
and Administrative   

General
and administrative costs totaled $231,550 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $497,796 for the comparable
period in 2015. This decrease was due primarily to credits received from charges incurred with a former professional service provider.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expense included $65,854 and $43,247 of non-cash,
stock-based compensation expense, respectively.  

Operating
Loss   

Our
operating loss was $451,807 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $690,728 for the comparable period in
2015, a decrease of $238,921. This decrease was due primarily to credits received from a former professional service provider.  

Other
Income (Expense), Net   

Interest
(Expense) Income    

Interest expense was
$1,116,328 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to interest expense of $1,584,830 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Interest expense primarily relate to debt discounts from the sale of senior secured convertible debentures
and other convertible and non-convertible notes. 

Change
in fair value of warrant derivative liability    

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we recorded non-cash income of $227,131 for warrant revaluation in our condensed consolidated statements
of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability related to warrants issued in our private placement
offerings. This decrease in fair value was primarily due to lower volatility in the price of the Company s common stock
at September 30, 2016 as compared to the price on June 30, 2016. The components for determining the fair value of the warrants
are contained in the table in Note 4 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Change
in fair value of conversion option liability    

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded non-cash income of $395,997 for conversion option revaluation in our condensed
consolidated statements of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the conversion option liability related to convertible
debt. This decrease in fair value was primarily due to lower volatility in the price of the Company s common stock at September
30, 2016 as compared to the price on June 30, 2016 or the date the debt was incurred during the quarter and the shorter time to
maturity of the debt. The components for determining the fair value of the conversion option liabilities are contained in the
table in Note 4 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Other
Expense    

We had minimal other
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and zero for the comparable period in 2015. 

Net
Loss Applicable to Common Shareholders   

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss to common shareholders of $945,207 or $(0.03) per share, as compared to a net
loss to common shareholders of $656,217 or $(0.03) per share in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The weighted average
common shares outstanding for the period increased because of the issuance of shares of common stock to investor relations firms
for services rendered and sales of common stock. 

Comparison
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenue   

We
recognized total revenue of $1,556,776 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1,433,572 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $123,204 or 9%. This increase is attributable to increases in the sales of our
products and services as detailed below.  

Products,
Services, Other . Revenue from the sale of products and services increased 22% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
as compared to the year-earlier period from $1,174,391 to $1,429,487. This increase was primarily attributable to sales of the
NEP2320 Enhanced Barocycler and the launch and subsequent sale of the Barocycler 2320EXTREME PCT-based instrument systems. Sales
of consumables also increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the year-earlier period, from $124,687
to $149,819, an increase of 20%.  

Grant
Revenue . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded grant revenue of $127,289 compared to grant revenue
of $259,181 in the comparable period in 2015. Work on the $1.05 million NIH grant decreased during the first half of 2016 as we
needed to wait for certain significant parts to be manufactured. These parts were received during the second quarter of 2016,
which should result in an increase in grant work in future periods.  

Cost
of Products and Services   

The
cost of products and services was $727,698 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $575,780 for the comparable
period in 2015. Gross profit margin on products and services was 49% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to 51% for the prior period. Cost of products increased concomitant with the increase in product sales recorded for the period.  

Research
and Development   

Research
and development expenditures were $925,015 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $878,899 in the same
period in 2015, an increase of $46,116 or 5%. This increase resulted primarily from the addition of a Ph.D. level electrical engineer,
costs related to the continued development of an enhanced rape kit test based on the PCT Platform, and a rent increase related
to the additional R D space.  

Research
and development expense recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included $50,766 and $41,172 of non-cash,
stock-based compensation expense, respectively.  

Selling
and Marketing   

Selling
and marketing expenses increased to $609,501 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $574,289 for the comparable period
in 2015, an increase of $35,212 or 6%. This increase is primarily attributed to an increase in part-time employee related costs
over the summer and holiday periods.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, selling and marketing expense included $32,404 and $27,386 of non-cash, stock-based
compensation expense, respectively.  

General
and Administrative   

General
and administrative costs totaled $1,853,010 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $2,034,040 for the comparable

stock-based compensation expense, respectively.  

Operating
Loss   

Our
operating loss was $2,558,448 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $2,629,436 for the comparable period
in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to credits from a former professional services provider offset by research and development
and investor relations activities.  

Other
Income (Expense), Net   

Interest
(Expense) Income    

Interest expense was
$2,961,708 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to interest expense of $2,831,106 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Interest expense primarily relate to debt discounts from the sale of senior secured convertible debentures
and other convertible and non-convertible notes. 

Change
in fair value of warrant derivative liability    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded non-cash income of $59,864 for warrant revaluation in our consolidated statements
of operations due to an overall decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability related to warrants issued in our private
placement offerings. The components for determining the fair value of the warrants are contained in the table in Note 4 of the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Change
in fair value of conversion option liability    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded non-cash charges of $472,364 for conversion option revaluation in our condensed
consolidated statements of operations due to increases in the fair value of the conversion option liability related to convertible
debt. We recorded $1,337,510 as non-cash charge at issuance of these convertible debentures. The components for determining the
fair value of the conversion option liabilities are contained in the table in Note 4 of the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements.  

Other
Expense    

Other
Expense totaled $1,112 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $513,352 for the comparable period in 2015.
The prior period activity represented revaluations for conversion options.  

Net
Loss Applicable to Common Shareholders   

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss to common shareholders of $5,933,768 or ($0.23) per share as compared to a net
loss to common shareholders of $3,451,928 or $(0.17) per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The weighted average
common shares outstanding for the period increased because of the issuance of shares of common stock to investor relations firms
for services rendered and conversions of Series K preferred stock into common stock. 

Liquidity
and Financial Condition    

We
have experienced negative cash flows from operations with respect to our pressure cycling technology business since our inception.
As of September 30, 2016, we did not have adequate working capital resources to satisfy our current liabilities and as a result,
we have substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We have been successful in raising cash through
debt and equity offerings in the past and as described in Note 6 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we completed an over-subscribed $5 million debt financing on March 21, 2016, raising
a total of $6.3 million between July 2015 and March 2016. We have efforts in place to continue to raise cash through debt and
equity offerings.  

We
will need substantial additional capital to fund our operations in future periods. In the event that we are unable to obtain financing
on acceptable terms, or at all, we will likely be required to cease our operations, pursue a plan to sell our operating assets,
or otherwise modify our business strategy, which could materially harm our future business prospects.  

Net cash used in operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,737,516 as compared to $2,679,949 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The increase in cash used in operations in 2016 is principally due to the interest expense from the senior convertible debentures. 

Cash used in investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was not significant. 

Net cash provided by
financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,665,945 as compared to $2,289,538 for the same period
in the prior year. The cash from financing activities in the period ending September 30, 2016 included $2,102,382 from senior
secured convertible debt. We also received $865,150 from non-convertible debt, net of fees, less payment on non-convertible debt
of $781,221. In the prior year we received $3,991,437 from convertible debt and $1,300,000 in proceeds from non-convertible debt. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

This
Item 3 is not applicable to us as a smaller reporting company and has been omitted.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 filings are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief
Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognized that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management was necessarily required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that
evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective.  

Our
conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 is due to the continued presence
of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015. These material weaknesses are the following:  

We
    identified a lack of sufficient segregation of duties. Specifically, this material weakness is such that the design over these
    areas relies primarily on detective controls and could be strengthened by adding preventative controls to properly safeguard
    Company assets.   

Management
    has identified a lack of sufficient personnel in the accounting function due to our limited resources with appropriate skills,
    training and experience to perform the review processes to ensure the complete and proper application of generally accepted
    accounting principles, particularly as it relates to valuation of warrants and other complex debt /equity transactions. Specifically,
    this material weakness resulted in audit adjustments to the annual consolidated financial statements and revisions to related
    disclosures, valuation of warrants and other equity transactions.   

Limited
    policies and procedures that cover recording and reporting of financial transactions.   

We
continue to plan to remediate those material weaknesses as follows:  

Improve
    the effectiveness of the accounting group by augmenting our existing resources with additional consultants or employees to
    assist in the analysis and recording of complex accounting transactions, and to simultaneously achieve desired organizational
    structuring for improved segregation of duties. We plan to mitigate this identified deficiency by hiring an independent consultant
    once we generate significantly more revenue or raise significant additional working capital.   

Improve
    expert review and achieve desired segregation procedures by strengthening cross approval of various functions including quarterly
    internal audit procedures where appropriate.   

During
the period covered by this Report, we implemented and performed additional substantive procedures, such as supervisory review
of work papers and consistent use of financial models used in equity valuations, to ensure our condensed consolidated financial
statements as of and for the three month and nine month period ended September 30, 2016, are fairly stated in all material respects
in accordance with GAAP. We have not, however, been able to fully remediate the material weaknesses due to our limited financial
resources. Our remediation efforts are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing
the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material
manner.  

Except
as described above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period
ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over
financial reporting.  

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

We
are not currently involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government
agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our
subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our
subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse
effect.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors   

Factors
that could cause or contribute to differences in our future financial and operating results include those discussed in the risk
factors set forth in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The risks described in our
Form 10-K and this Report are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we do not currently
consider significant may also have an adverse effect on the Company. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, results
of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer.  

There
have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015.  

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   

Please
refer to Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, Convertible Debt and Other Debt, for a discussion of the sale of unregistered securities that took place for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016.  

In
addition, on various dates from January to September 2016 the Company issued 755,000 shares of restricted common stock to investor
relations firms for services rendered.  

On
August 29, September 9 and September 14, 2016, we completed three tranches of a private placement (the  Fall 2016 Private
Placement ), pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 1,125,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value (the  Shares ),
for a purchase price of $0.40 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately $450,000 . The Shares were issued
and sold to a total of 2 accredited investors pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into as of the date of their
investments. The investors received warrants to purchase a total of 1,125,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an
exercise price of $0.50. The warrants expire 5 years after issuance.  

The
above securities were issued without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ),
in reliance upon the exemption from registration set forth in Rule 506 of Regulation D ( Regulation D ) promulgated
under the Securities Act. We based such reliance upon representations made by each purchaser of the securities, including, but
not limited to, representations as to the purchaser s status as an  accredited investor  (as defined in Rule
501(a) under Regulation D) and the purchaser s investment intent. The securities were not offered or sold by any form of
general solicitation or general advertising, as such terms are used in Rule 502 under Regulation D. The securities may not be
offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement or an exemption from the registration requirements
under applicable federal and state securities laws.  

On
October 11 and November 10, 2016, we completed two additional tranches of the Fall 2016 Private Placement, pursuant to which we
sold an aggregate of 400,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value (the  Shares ), for a purchase price of $0.40
per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately $160,000. The Shares were issued and sold to a total of 2 accredited
investors pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement entered into as of the date of their investments. The investors received
warrants to purchase a total of 400,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.50. The warrants
expire 5 years after issuance.

            Issue
                                         Date:   

THIS
COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT (the   Warrant  ) certifies that, for value received, or its assigns (the   Holder  )
is entitled, upon the terms and subject to the limitations on exercise and the conditions hereinafter set forth, at any time on
or after (the   Initial Exercise Date  ) and on or prior to the close of business on the five year anniversary
of the Initial Exercise Date (the   Termination Date  ) but not thereafter, to subscribe for and purchase from
Pressure BioSciences, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the   Company  ), up to shares (as subject to adjustment
hereunder, the   Warrant Shares  ) of Common Stock. The purchase price of one share of Common Stock under this
Warrant shall be equal to the Exercise Price, as defined in Section 2(b).  

Section
1. Definitions.  Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in that certain
Subscription Agreement (the   Purchase Agreement  ), dated of even date herewith among the Company and the purchaser s
signatory thereto.  

Section
2. Exercise.   

a)
 Exercise of Warrant.  Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any
time or times on or after the Initial Exercise Date and on or before the Termination Date by delivery to the Company (or such
other office or agency of the Company as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the
Holder appearing on the books of the Company) of a duly executed facsimile copy of the Notice of Exercise form annexed hereto
and within three (3) Trading Days of the date said Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company, the Company shall have received
payment of the aggregate Exercise Price of the shares thereby purchased by wire transfer or cashier s check drawn on a United
States bank or, if available, pursuant to the cashless exercise procedure specified in Section 2(c) below. No ink-original Notice
of Exercise shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of
Exercise form be required. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender
this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has been
exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within three (3) Trading
Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases
of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number
of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and
the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. The Company
shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise Form within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such notice.  The Holder
and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following
the purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase hereunder at any
given time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.   

b)
 Exercise Price.  The exercise price per share of the Common Stock under this Warrant shall be $0.50, subject to adjustment
hereunder (the   Exercise Price  ).  

c)
 Cashless Exercise.  This Warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, by means of a  cashless exercise  in
accordance with this Section 2(c), if at any time after the earlier of: (i) the 180 day anniversary of the date of the Purchase
Agreement; and (ii) the completion of the then-applicable holding period required by Rule 144, or any successor provision then
in effect, there is no effective Registration Statement registering, or no current prospectus available for, the resale of the
Warrant Shares by the Holder, then this Warrant may be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a  cashless
exercise.  Pursuant to a cashless exercise, the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares equal to
the quotient obtained by utilizing the formula below. The Company is not required to pay cash if it can only deliver upon settlement
of a  cashless exercise , Warrant Shares that are not registered under the Securities Act. The formula consists of
dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:  

(A)    =
                                         the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date on which Holder elects to
                                         exercise this Warrant by means of a  cashless exercise,  as set forth in
                                         the applicable Notice of Exercise;    

(B)    =
                                         the Exercise Price of this Warrant, as adjusted hereunder; and    

(X)    =
                                         the number of Warrant Shares that would be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in
                                         accordance with the terms of this Warrant if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise
                                         rather than a cashless exercise.  

d)
 Mechanics of Exercise.   

i.        Delivery
of Warrant Shares Upon Exercise.  Warrant Shares purchased hereunder shall be transmitted by the Transfer Agent to the Holder
by crediting the account of the Holder s prime broker with The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal
at Custodian system (  DWAC  ) if the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is an
effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the Warrant Shares to or resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder
or (B) the shares are eligible for resale by the Holder without the holding period, volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant
to Rule 144, and otherwise by physical delivery to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise by the date that
is three (3) Trading Days after the latest of (A) the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise and (B) surrender of this
Warrant (if required) (such date, the   Warrant Share Delivery Date  ). The Warrant Shares shall be deemed to
have been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of
record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised, with payment to the Company of the Exercise
Price (or by cashless exercise, if permitted) and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant to Section 2(d)(vi)
prior to the issuance of such shares, having been paid.  

ii.        Delivery
of New Warrants Upon Exercise.  If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder
and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant
evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall
in all other respects be identical with this Warrant.  

iii.        Rescission
Rights.  If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section
2(d)(i) by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind such exercise.  

iv.        Compensation
for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Warrant Shares Upon Exercise.  In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,
if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares pursuant to an exercise on or before
the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction
or otherwise) or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a
sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a   Buy-In  ),
then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase price
(including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying
(1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue
times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the
Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored
(in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would
have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder
purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares
of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately
preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice
indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount
of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law
or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s
failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.  

v.        No
Fractional Shares or Scrip.  No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise
of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the
Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction
multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share.  

vi.        Charges,
Taxes and Expenses.  Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or
other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of Warrant Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company,
and such Warrant Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder;  provided ,
 however,  that in the event that Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant
when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the
Company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto.
The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Exercise.  

vii.        Closing
of Books.  The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of
this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.  

e)
 Holder s Exercise Limitations.  The Company shall not affect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not
have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect
to such issuance after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder s
Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates), would beneficially
own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of
shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of
shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon: (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially
owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates; and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any
other securities of the Company subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein
(including, without limitation, any other Warrants) beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates. Except as set forth
in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company
is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder
is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation contained
in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned
by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion
of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder s determination of whether this
Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion
of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction,
the Holder will be deemed to represent to the Company each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion
has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the
accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined
in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this
Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (A) the Company s most recent periodic or annual report
filed with the Commission, as the case may be; (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company; or (C) a more recent written
notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or
oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of
shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after
giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates
since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The   Beneficial Ownership
Limitation   shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to
the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder. The Holder, upon not less than
61 days  prior notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section
2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock
outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant held by the
Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any such increase or decrease will not be effective until
the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this paragraph shall
be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this
paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained
herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained
in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.  

f)
 Company Warrant Call.  Commencing on a date which is 180 days after the Final Closing, the Company shall have the right,
subject to satisfaction of the conditions in this Section 2(f), to cause the exercise of this Warrant (  Forced Exercise  ).
The Company shall deliver prior written notice to the Holder at least ten (10) business days (  Forced Exercise Notice  )
prior to the effective date (the   Forced Exercise Effective Date  ) of such Forced Exercise. In order to effectuate
a Forced Exercise, the following conditions shall be satisfied as of the Forced Exercise Effective Date: (i) the Company shall
have satisfied and be current all of its filing requirements under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934; (ii) the VWAP of the
Common Stock shall equal or exceed 300% of the Purchase Price of the Securities for either 10 consecutive trading days, or 15
of 25 consecutive trading days; (iii) the Warrant Shares may be delivered to the Holder via DWAC; and (iv) all of the Warrants
issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement are called by the Company for a Forced Exercise. The Holder shall have the option to
exercise this Warrant, on a Cashless Exercise basis pursuant to Section 2(c) above, during such ten (10) day notice period.  

Section
3. Certain Adjustments.   

a)
 Stock Dividends and Stock Splits.  If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding:  

(i)
pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common
Stock or any Common Stock Equivalents (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the
Company upon the exercise of any options or warrants, including the Warrants); (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a larger number of shares; (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a smaller number of shares; or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares
of capital stock of the Company, then the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event and
of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the number
of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this
Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective
immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.  

b)
 [Intentionally Omitted.]   

c)        Subsequent
Rights Offerings.  If the Company, at any time while the Warrant is outstanding, shall issue rights, options or warrants to
all holders of Common Stock (and not to the Holder) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price
per share less than the VWAP on the record date mentioned below, then the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction, of
which the denominator shall be the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights, options
or warrants plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase, and of which the numerator
shall be the number of shares of the  Common Stock  outstanding on the date of issuance of  such rights,  options or
warrants plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered (assuming receipt
by the Company in full of all consideration payable upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants) would purchase at such
VWAP. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such rights, options or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately
after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants.  

d)        Pro
Rata Distributions.  If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of Common
Stock (and not to the Holder) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash dividends) or rights or warrants
to subscribe for or purchase any security other than the Common, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be adjusted by
multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled
to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the VWAP determined as of the record date mentioned
above, and of which the numerator shall be such VWAP on such record date less the then per share fair market value at such record
date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness or rights or warrants so distributed applicable to one outstanding
share of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. In either case the adjustments shall be described
in a statement provided to the Holder of the  portion of assets or evidences  of indebtedness so distributed or such subscription
rights applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall
become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above.  

e)        Fundamental
Transaction.  If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in  one or more
related transactions  effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person; (ii) the Company, directly
or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially
all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions; (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange
offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell,
tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of more than 50% of
the outstanding Common Stock; (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification,
reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is
effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property; or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in
one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without
limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby
such other Person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common
Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making
or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a   Fundamental Transaction  ),
then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would
have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any
limitation in Section 2(e) or Section 2(f) on the exercise of this Warrant), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor
or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the   Alternate
Consideration  ) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation
in Section 2(e) or Section 2(f) on the exercise of this Warrant). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the
Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration
issuable in respect of one (1) share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise
Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the
Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received
in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon
any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental
Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the   Successor Entity  ) to assume in writing all of the
obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section
3(e) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the holders of a majority of the Warrants
prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant
a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant
which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent
to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the
exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder
to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental
Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being
for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction),
and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction,
the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction,
the provisions of this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents referring to the  Company  shall refer instead
to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the
Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named
as the Company herein.  

f)        Calculations.
 All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may
be. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date
shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) issued and outstanding.  

g)        Notice
to Holder.   

i.     Adjustment
                                         to Exercise Price.  Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision
                                         of this Section 3, the Company shall promptly deliver to each Holder a notice setting
                                         forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the number
                                         of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.    

ii.     Notice
                                         to Allow Exercise by Holder.  If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any
                                         other distribution in whatever form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare
                                         a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the
                                         Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or
                                         warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of
                                         any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in
                                         connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger
                                         to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of
                                         the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock
                                         is converted into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize
                                         the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of
                                         the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be filed at each office or
                                         agency maintained for the purpose of exercise of this Warrant, and shall cause to be
                                         delivered to the Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register
                                         of the Company, at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective
                                         date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be
                                         taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants,
                                         or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock
                                         of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants
                                         are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger,
                                         sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date
                                         as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled
                                         to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable
                                         upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange;
                                         provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery
                                         thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified
                                         in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes, or contains,
                                         material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the
                                         Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current
                                         Report on Form 8-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to exercise this Warrant during
                                         the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering
                                         such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.    

Section
4. Transfer of Warrant.   

a)        Transferability.
 Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws and the conditions set forth in Section 4(d) hereof and to the provisions
of Section 4.1 of the Purchase Agreement, this Warrant and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any registration
rights) are transferable, in whole or in part, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated
agent, together with a written assignment of this Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder
or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender
and, if required, such payment, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or
assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue
to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the
Company unless the Holder has assigned this Warrant in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company
within three (3) Trading Days of the date the Holder delivers an assignment form to the Company assigning this Warrant full. The
Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance herewith, may be exercised by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without
having a new Warrant issued.  

b)        New
Warrants.  This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of
the Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed
by the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4 ( a), as to any transfer which may be involved
in such division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or
Warrants to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated
the original Issue Date and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant thereto.  

c)        Warrant
Register.  The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the   Warrant
Register  ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered
Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder,
and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary.  

d)        Transfer
Restrictions; Registration Rights.  At the time of the surrender of this Warrant in connection with any transfer of this Warrant,
the transfer of this Warrant shall be either: (i) registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act and under applicable state securities or blue sky laws or exempt therefrom; or (ii) eligible for resale without holding period,
volume or manner-of-sale restrictions or current public information requirements pursuant to Rule 144. The Holder and any permitted
transfer shall be entitled to the registration rights with respect to the resale of the Warrant Shares as described under the
Purchase Agreement.  

e)        Representation
by the Holder.  The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants that it is acquiring this Warrant and, upon any
exercise hereof, will acquire the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, for its own account and not with a view to or for
distributing or reselling such Warrant Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities
law, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act.  

Section
5. Miscellaneous.   

a)        No
Rights as Stockholder Until Exercise.  This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights, dividends or other rights
as a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in Section 2(d)(i), except as expressly set forth in
Section 3.  

b)        Loss,
Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant.  The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant
Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case
of the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate,
if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation,
in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate.  

c)        Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc.  If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required
or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
Business Day.  

d)        Authorized
Shares.   

(i)       The
Company covenants that on and after March 31, 2017 until such time as the Warrant is no longer outstanding, it will reserve from
its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon
the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall
constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise
of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that
such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements
of the Trading Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued
upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by
this Warrant and payment for such Warrant Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect
of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue).  

(ii)       Except
and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
amending its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will: (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above
the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value; (ii) take all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares
upon the exercise of this Warrant; and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions
or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform
its obligations under this Warrant.  

(iii)
       Before taking any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant
Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions
thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof.  

e)        Jurisdiction.
 All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.  

f)        Restrictions.
 The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered, will have restrictions
upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws.  

g)        Nonwaiver
and Expenses.  No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate
as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies, notwithstanding the fact that
all rights hereunder terminate on the Termination Date. If the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision
of this Warrant, which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall
be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys  fees, including those
of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of
its rights, powers or remedies hereunder.  

h)        Notices.
 Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall be
delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement.  

i)        Limitation
of Liability.  No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase
Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder
for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the Company.  

j)        Remedies.
 The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled
to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation
for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert
the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.  

k)        Successors
and Assigns.  Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns
of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and
shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares.  

l)        Amendment.
 This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and the Holder.  

m)        Severability.
 Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions
of this Warrant.  

n)        Headings.
 The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part
of this Warrant.  

o)        Governing
Law.  All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be governed
by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to the principles
of conflict of laws thereof. Each party agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the interpretation, enforcement and defense
of the transactions contemplated by any of the Transaction Documents (whether brought against a party hereto or its respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees or agents) shall be commenced in the state and federal courts sitting
in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan (the   New York Courts  ). The Holder and the Company each hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection
herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of any of
the Transaction Documents), and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such New York Courts, or such New York Courts are improper or inconvenient
venue for such proceeding. The Holder and the Company each hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents
to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight
delivery (with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Warrant and agrees that
such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to limit in any way any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law. The Holder and the Company each
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Warrant or the transactions contemplated hereby. If any party shall commence an
action or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Warrant, then the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be
reimbursed by the other party for its attorneys  fees and other costs and expenses incurred in the investigation, preparation
and prosecution of such action or proceeding.

and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which they are formed, and have the requisite power and authorization
to own their properties and to carry on their business as now being conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted. Each
of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign entity to do business and is in good standing in every
jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary,
except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect. As used
in this Agreement,   Material Adverse Effect   means any material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, operations (including results thereof), condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Company or
any Subsidiary, individually or taken as a whole, (ii) the transactions contemplated hereby or in any of the other Transaction
Documents or (iii) the authority or ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to perform any of their respective obligations
under any of the Transaction Documents. Other than the Persons set forth on Schedule 3(a), the Company has no Subsidiaries.   Subsidiaries  
means any Person in which the Company, directly or indirectly, (I) owns any of the outstanding capital stock or holds any equity
or similar interest of such Person or (II) controls or operates all or any part of the business, operations or administration
of such Person, and each of the foregoing, is individually referred to herein as a   Subsidiary .    

(b)                
 Authorization; Enforcement; Validity . The Company has the requisite power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to issue the Securities in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by the Company, and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, without limitation, the issuance of the Common Shares and the
issuance of the Warrants and the reservation for issuance and issuance of the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants)
have been duly authorized by the Company s board of directors or other governing body and no further filing, consent or
authorization is required by the Company, its board of directors or its stockholders or other governing body. This Agreement has
been, and the other Transaction Documents will be prior to the Tranche Closing Date, duly executed and delivered by the Company
or its agent, and each constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity or applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation or similar laws relating to, or affecting generally, the enforcement
of applicable creditors  rights and remedies and except as rights to indemnification and to contribution may be limited
by federal or state securities law.  

(c)                
 Issuance of Securities . The Common Shares, when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from
all preemptive or similar rights, taxes, liens, charges and other encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof, with the holders
being entitled to all rights accorded to a holder of Common Stock. The Warrants are duly authorized and upon issuance in accordance
with the terms of the Transaction Documents shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free from all preemptive
or similar rights, taxes, liens, charges and other encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof. Upon exercise in accordance
with the Warrants, the Warrant Shares, when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all preemptive
or similar rights, taxes, liens, charges and other encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof, with the holders being entitled
to all rights accorded to a holder of Common Stock. Subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Purchasers
in this Agreement, the offer and issuance by the Company of the Securities is exempt from registration under the 1933 Act.  

(d)                
 Acknowledgment Regarding Purchaser s Purchase of Securities . The Company acknowledges and agrees that to its actual
knowledge each Purchaser is acting solely in the capacity of an arm s length purchaser with respect to the Transaction Documents
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company further represents to each Purchaser that the Company s
decision to enter into the Transaction Documents to which it is a party has been based solely on the independent evaluation by
the Company and its representatives.  

(e)                
 Dilutive Effect . The Company understands and acknowledges that the number of Warrant Shares will increase in certain circumstances.
The Company further acknowledges that its obligation to issue the Warrant Shares upon exercise of the Warrants in accordance with
this Agreement and the Warrants is, absolute and unconditional regardless of the dilutive effect that such issuance may have on
the ownership interests of other stockholders of the Company.  

(f)                 
 Conduct of Business; Regulatory Permits . Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any term of

outstanding series of preferred stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their organizational charter, certificate of
formation or certificate of incorporation or bylaws, respectively. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation
of any judgment, decree or order or any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  

(g)                
 Investment Company Status . The Company is not, and upon consummation of the sale of the Securities will not be, an  investment
company,  an affiliate of an  investment company,  a company controlled by an  investment company 
or an  affiliated person  of, or  promoter  or  principal underwriter  for, an  investment
company  as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  

(h)                
 Disclosure . The Company confirms that neither it nor any other Person acting on its behalf has provided any of the Purchasers
or their agents or counsel with any information that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to constitute material, non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the existence of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, and the Memorandum. The Company understands and confirms that each of the Purchasers
will rely on the foregoing representations in effecting transactions in securities of the Company. All disclosure provided to
the Purchasers regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, their businesses and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the schedules to this Agreement, furnished by or on behalf of the Company, the Placement Agent or the Company s Subsidiaries
is true and correct and does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
event or circumstance has occurred or information exists with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their
business, properties, liabilities, prospects, operations (including results thereof) or conditions (financial or otherwise), which,
under applicable law, rule or regulation, requires public disclosure at or before the date hereof or announcement by the Company
but which has not been so publicly disclosed. The Company acknowledges and agrees that no Purchaser makes or has made any representations
or warranties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby other than those specifically set forth in Section 2.  

4.      COVENANTS.     

(a)                
 Form D and Blue Sky . The Company shall file a Form D with respect to the Securities as required under Regulation D and
to provide a copy thereof to each Purchaser promptly after such filing. The Company shall, on or before the Tranche Closing Date,
take such action as the Company shall reasonably determine is necessary in order to obtain an exemption for, or to, qualify the
Securities for sale to the Purchasers on the Tranche Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement under applicable securities or  Blue
Sky  laws of the states of the United States (or to obtain an exemption from such qualification), and shall provide evidence
of any such action so taken to the Purchasers on or prior to the Tranche Closing Date. Without limiting any other obligation of
the Company under this Agreement, the Company shall timely make all filings and reports relating to the offer and sale of the
Securities required under all applicable securities laws (including, without limitation, all applicable federal securities laws
and all applicable  Blue Sky  laws), and the Company shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws,
statutes, rules, regulations and the like relating to the offering and sale of the Securities to the Purchasers.   

(b)                
 Use of Proceeds . The Company will use the proceeds from the sale of the Securities for general corporate purposes, but
not, directly or indirectly, for (i) the satisfaction of any indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than
for trade payables incurred in the normal course of business; and (ii) the redemption or repurchase of any securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.   

(c)               
 Reservation of Shares (i)    . On and after March 31, 2017 until such time as the Warrant is no longer outstanding,
the Company will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance
of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant.  

5.      TRANSFER
                                         AGENT INSTRUCTIONS; LEGEND.     

  (a)                
 Transfer Agent Instructions . The Company shall issue irrevocable instructions to its transfer agent and any subsequent
transfer agent in a form acceptable to each of the Purchasers (the   Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions  )
to issue certificates, registered in the name of each Purchaser or its respective nominee(s), for the Warrant Shares in such amounts
as specified from time to time by each Purchaser to the Company upon the exercise of the Warrants (as the case may be). The Company
represents and warrants that no instruction other than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions referred to in this Section
5(a), and stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 2(g) hereof, will be given by the Company to its transfer agent
with respect to the Securities, and that the Securities shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of the
Company, as applicable, to the extent provided in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. If a Purchaser effects a
sale, assignment or transfer of the Securities in accordance with Section 2(g), the Company shall permit the transfer and shall
promptly instruct its transfer agent to issue one or more certificates in such name and in such denominations as specified by
such Purchaser to effect such sale, transfer or assignment. In the event that such sale, assignment or transfer involves Warrant
Shares sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement or in compliance with Rule 144 (assuming
the transferor is not an affiliate of the Company), the transfer agent shall issue such shares to such Purchaser, assignee or
transferee (as the case may be) without any restrictive legend in accordance with Section 5(c) below. The Company acknowledges
that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to a Purchaser. Accordingly, the Company acknowledges
that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Section 5(a) will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of
a breach or threatened breach by the Company of the provisions of this Section 5(a), that a Purchaser shall be entitled, in addition
to all other available remedies, to seek an order and/or injunction restraining any breach and requiring immediate issuance and
transfer, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.   

(b)                
 Legends . Each Purchaser understands that the Securities have been issued (or will be issued in the case of the Warrant
Shares) pursuant to an exemption from registration or qualification under the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws, and
except as set forth below, the Securities shall bear any legend as required by the  blue sky  laws of any state and
a restrictive legend in substantially the following form (and a stop-transfer order may be placed against transfer of such stock
certificates):  

[NEITHER
THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE [EXERCISABLE]

OF COUNSEL TO THE HOLDER (IF REQUESTED BY THE COMPANY), IN A FORM REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT
REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD OR ELIGIBLE TO BE SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING
THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT
SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.  

(c)
 Removal of Legends . Certificates evidencing Securities shall not be required to contain the legend set forth in Section
5(b) above or any other legend (i) while a registration statement (including a Registration Statement) covering the resale of
such Securities is effective under the 1933 Act, (ii) following any sale of such Securities pursuant to Rule 144 (assuming the
transferor is not an affiliate of the Company), (iii) if such Securities are eligible to be sold, assigned or transferred under
Rule 144 (provided that a Purchaser provides the Company with reasonable assurances that such Securities are eligible for sale,
assignment or transfer under Rule 144 which shall not include an opinion of counsel), (iv) in connection with a sale, assignment
or other transfer (other than under Rule 144), provided that such Purchaser provides the Company with an opinion of counsel to
such Purchaser, in a generally acceptable form, to the effect that such sale, assignment or transfer of the Securities may be
made without registration under the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act or (v) if such legend is not required under applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act (including, without limitation, controlling judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued by
the SEC). If a legend is not required pursuant to the foregoing, the Company shall no later than two (2) Trading Days following
the delivery by a Purchaser to the Company or the transfer agent (with notice to the Company) of a legended certificate representing
such Securities (endorsed or with stock powers attached, signatures guaranteed, and otherwise in form necessary to affect the
reissuance and/or transfer, if applicable), together with any other deliveries from such Purchaser as may be required above in
this Section 5(c), as directed by such Purchaser, either: (A) provided that the Company s transfer agent is participating
in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program and such Securities are Common Shares or Warrant Shares, credit the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock to which such Purchaser shall be entitled to such Purchaser s or its designee s balance
account with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system or (B) if the Company s transfer agent is not participating
in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver (via reputable overnight courier) to such Purchaser,
a certificate representing such Securities that is free from all restrictive and other legends, registered in the name of such
Purchaser or its designee (the date by which such credit is so required to be made to the balance account of such Purchaser s
or such Purchaser s nominee with DTC or such certificate is required to be delivered to such Purchaser pursuant to the foregoing
is referred to herein as the   Required Delivery Date  ). The Company shall be responsible for any transfer agent
fees or DTC fees with respect to any issuance of Securities or the removal of any legends with respect to any Securities in accordance
herewith.

of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law
or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of New York. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the state and federal courts sitting in The City of New York, for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection
herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert

Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action
or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof to such party at the address for such notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that
such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed
to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT
IT MAY HAVE TO, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR

(b)                
 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in two or more identical counterparts, all of which shall be considered one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other
party. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by an e-mail which contains a portable document
format (.pdf) file of an executed signature page, such signature page shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party
executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such signature page were an original
thereof.  

(c)

include the masculine, feminine, neuter, singular and plural forms thereof. The terms  including,   includes, 
 include  and words of like import shall be construed broadly as if followed by the words  without limitation. 
The terms  herein,   hereunder,   hereof  and words of like import refer to this entire Agreement
instead of just the provision in which they are found.  

(d)                
 Severability . If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to be invalid or unenforceable
by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision that would otherwise be prohibited, invalid or unenforceable shall be deemed
amended to apply to the broadest extent that it would be valid and enforceable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of such
provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement so long as this Agreement as so modified
continues to express, without material change, the original intentions of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the
prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not substantially impair the respective
expectations or reciprocal obligations of the parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred
upon the parties. The parties will endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s)
with a valid provision(s), the effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable
provision(s).

and thereto and the instruments referenced herein and therein contain the entire understanding of the parties solely with respect
to the matters covered herein and therein.   

(f)

with clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, respectively.  

(g)                
 Successors and Assigns . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and assigns, including any purchasers of any of the Securities. The Company shall not assign this Agreement or any
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Purchasers, including, without limitation, by way of
a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the Warrants) (unless the Company is in compliance with the applicable provisions governing
Fundamental Transactions set forth in the Warrants). A Purchaser may assign some or all of its rights hereunder in connection
with any transfer of any of its Securities without the consent of the Company, in which event such assignee shall be deemed to
be a Purchaser hereunder with respect to such assigned rights.  

(h)                
 No Third Party Beneficiaries . This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person.  

(i)                  
 Survival . The representations, warranties, agreements and covenants shall survive the Tranche Closing Date. Each Purchaser
shall be responsible only for its own representations, warranties, agreements and covenants hereunder.  

(j)                 
 Further Assurances . Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done and performed, all such further acts and things,
and shall execute and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as any other party may reasonably
request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.  

(k)                
 Construction . The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their
mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party. No specific representation or warranty shall
limit the generality or applicability of a more general representation or warranty. Each and every reference to share prices,
shares of Common Stock and any other numbers in this Agreement that relate to the Common Stock shall be automatically adjusted
for stock splits, stock combinations and other similar transactions that occur with respect to the Common Stock after the date
of this Agreement.  

(l)                  
 Remedies . Each Purchaser and each holder of any Securities shall have all rights and remedies set forth in the Transaction
Documents and all rights and remedies which such holders have been granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and
all of the rights which such holders have under any law. Any Person having any rights under any provision of this Agreement shall
be entitled to enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other security), to recover damages by reason of any
breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law. Furthermore, the Company recognizes
that in the event that it or any Subsidiary fails to perform, observe, or discharge any or all of its or such Subsidiary s
(as the case may be) obligations under the Transaction Documents, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Purchasers.
The Company therefore agrees that the Purchasers shall be entitled to seek specific performance and/or temporary, preliminary
and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in any such case without the necessity
of proving actual damages and without posting a bond or other security.  

(m)              
 Withdrawal Right . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in (and without limiting any similar provisions of)
the Transaction Documents, whenever any Purchaser exercises a right, election, demand or option under a Transaction Document and
the Company or any Subsidiary does not timely perform its related obligations within the periods therein provided, then such Purchaser
may rescind or withdraw, in its sole discretion from time to time upon written notice to the Company or such Subsidiary (as the
case may be), any relevant notice, demand or election in whole or in part without prejudice to its future actions and rights  

(p)        Independent
Nature of Purchasers  Obligations and Rights . The obligations of each Purchaser under the Transaction Documents are
several and not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the performance
of the obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document. Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction
Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers as, and
the Company acknowledges that the Purchasers do not so constitute, a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other
kind of group or entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as a group or entity
with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or any matters, and the Company
acknowledges that the Purchasers are not acting in concert or as a group, and the Company shall not assert any such claim, with
respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. The decision of each Purchaser to purchase
Securities pursuant to the Transaction Documents has been made by such Purchaser independently of any other Purchaser. Each Purchaser
acknowledges that no other Purchaser has acted as agent for such Purchaser in connection with such Purchaser making its investment
hereunder and that no other Purchaser will be acting as agent of such Purchaser in connection with monitoring such Purchaser s
investment in the Securities or enforcing its rights under the Transaction Documents. The Company and each Purchaser confirms
that each Purchaser has independently participated with the Company and its Subsidiaries in the negotiation of the transaction
contemplated hereby with the advice of its own counsel and advisors. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect
and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of any other Transaction
Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such
purpose. The use of a single agreement to effectuate the purchase and sale of the Securities contemplated hereby was solely in
the control of the Company, not the action or decision of any Purchaser, and was done solely for the convenience of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and not because it was required or requested to do so by any Purchaser. It is expressly understood and agreed
that each provision contained in this Agreement and in each other Transaction Document is between the Company, each Subsidiary
and a Purchaser, solely, and not between the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Purchasers collectively and not between and among
the Purchasers.
