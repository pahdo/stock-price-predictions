NOTE
1    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION   

Pingtan
Marine Enterprise Ltd. (the  Company  or  PME ), formerly China Growth Equity Investment Limited ( CGEI ),
incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted limited liability company, was incorporated as a blank check company on January
18, 2010 with the purpose of directly or indirectly acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, plan of arrangement,
recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination, an operating business, or control of such operating business
through contractual arrangements, that has its principal business and/or material operations located in the People s Republic
of China ( PRC ).  In connection with its initial business combination, in February 2013, CGEI changed its name
to Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd.  

On
October 24, 2012, CGEI and China Dredging Group Co., Ltd ( CDGC  or  China Dredging ) entered into a Merger
Agreement providing for the combination of CGEI and CDGC and on October 24, 2012, CGEI also acquired all of the outstanding capital
shares and other equity interests of Merchant Supreme Co., Ltd. ( Merchant Supreme ), a company incorporated on June
25, 2012, in British Virgin Island ( BVI ), as per a Share Purchase Agreement.  On February 25, 2013, the merger
between the Company, CDGC and Merchant Supreme became effective and has been accounted for as a  reverse merger  and
recapitalization since the common shareholders of CDGC and Merchant Supreme (i) owned a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares
of the Company immediately following the completion of the transaction, and (ii) have significant influence and the ability to
elect or appoint or to remove a majority of the members of the governing body of the combined entity. In accordance with the provision
of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805-40, CDGC and Merchant Supreme
are deemed the accounting acquirers and the Company is the legal acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction
is treated as a recapitalization of the Company. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are
reflected in the consolidated financial statements are those of CDGC, Merchant Supreme and their subsidiaries and are recorded
at the historical cost basis. The Company s assets, liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with the assets,
liabilities and results of operations of CDGC, Merchant Supreme and their subsidiaries subsequent to the acquisition date of February
25, 2013. Following the completion of the business combination which became effective on February 25, 2013, CDGC and Merchant
Supreme became the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company.  The ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share are listed
on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol  PME .  

In
order to place increased focus on fishing business and pursue more effective growth opportunities, the Company decided to exit
and sell the specialized dredging services operated by China Dredging; the Company completed the sale of CDGC and its subsidiaries
on December 4, 2013.  

On
February 9, 2015, the Company terminated its existing Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ) agreements, pursuant to an
Agreement of Termination dated February 9, 2015, entered into by and among Ms. Honghong Zhuo, Mr. Zhiyan Lin (each a shareholder
of Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd ( Pingtan Fishing ), together the  Pingtan
Fishing s Shareholders ), Pingtan Fishing and Pingtan Guansheng Ocean Fishing Co., Ltd. ( Pingtan Guansheng ).
On February 9, 2015, the Pingtan Fishing s Shareholders transferred 100% of their equity interest in Pingtan Fishing to
Fujian Heyue Marine Fishing Development Co., Ltd. ( Fujian Heyue ), pursuant to an Equity Transfer Agreement dated
February 9, 2015, entered into by and among the Pingtan Fishing s Shareholders, Pingtan Fishing and Fujian Heyue. On February
15, 2015, China Agriculture Industry Development Fund Co., Ltd. ( China Agriculture ) invested RMB 400 million (approximately
$65 million) into Pingtan Fishing for an 8% equity interest in Pingtan Fishing. After the restructuring transactions described
above, Pingtan Fishing and its entities became the 92% equity-owned subsidiaries of the Company and was no longer a VIE.

Fujian
Heyue, through its PRC subsidiary, Pingtan Fishing, engages in ocean fishing with its owned and licensed vessels within the Indian
Exclusive Economic Zone and Arafura Sea of Indonesia and the Western and Central Pacific Ocean of the international waters.  

The
Company meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through cash flow provided by operations, bank loans and related parties 
advances. The Indonesian government's moratorium on fishing licenses renewals creates uncertainty over fishing operations in Indonesian
waters. The Company s forecasts and projections, taking account of on-going operations in Indian waters and consideration
of opportunities in new fishing territories, such as acquisition of 6 licensed vessels to operate in the Western and Central Pacific
Ocean, shows that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   

Basis
of presentation (continued)   

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2016.  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses, and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Actual results
could materially differ from these estimates. Significant estimates in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include
allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for inventories, the useful life of property, plant and equipment, assumptions used in
assessing impairment of long-term assets and valuation of deferred tax assets and accruals for taxes due.   

Cash   

Cash consists of cash on hand and cash in banks. The Company maintains cash with various financial institutions
in the PRC and Hong Kong and none of these deposits are covered by insurance. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash
balances in the PRC are $502,516 and $11,276,429, respectively, and cash balances in Hong Kong are $65,415 and $172,255, respectively,
and are uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses in bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks on its
cash in bank accounts.  

Restricted
cash   

Restricted
cash consists of cash deposits held by China Development Bank to secure short term bank loans from China Development Bank. At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, restricted cash amounted $4,039,344 and $1,577,642, respectively.  

Fair
value of financial instruments   

The
Company adopted the guidance of ASC Topic 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes
methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as
follows:  

Level
 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
available at the measurement date .  

Level
 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets,
quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices
that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data .  

Level
 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions
on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information .  

The
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, inventories, advances
to suppliers, prepaid expenses, prepaid expenses   related parties, other receivables, other receivables   related
parties, accounts payable, accounts payable   related parties, bank loans, accrued liabilities and other payables, and due
to related parties approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. As of September
30, 2016, the Company does not have any assets or liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis at fair value. The Company s
short-term bank borrowings that are considered Level 2 financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as
of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company does not have any level 3 financial instruments.

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   

Fair
value of financial instruments (continued)   

ASC
Topic 825-10  Financial Instruments  allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and
liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is
irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses
for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair
value option to any outstanding instruments.  

Accounts
receivable   

Accounts
receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific
allowance when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual
receivable balance, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, a customer s historical
payment history, its current credit-worthiness and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts
at collection. The Company only grants credit terms to established customers who are deemed to be financially responsible.
Credit periods to customers are within 180 days after customers received the purchased goods. At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company has established, based on a review of its outstanding balances, an allowance for doubtful
accounts in the amounts of $251,610 and $372,634, respectively.    

Inventories   

Inventories,
consisting of frozen fish and marine catches, are stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the weighted average method.
The cost of inventories is comprised of fuel, freight, depreciation, direct labor, consumables, and government levied charges
and taxes. Consumables include fishing nets and metal containers used by fishing vessels. The Company s fishing fleets in
Indian and Indonesian waters and Western and Central Pacific Ocean of the international waters operate throughout the year, although
the May to July period demonstrates lower catch quantities compared to the October to January period, which is the peak season.  

An
allowance is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected
market value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, the Company will record reserve for the difference
between the cost and the market value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates. At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, the Company recorded a reserve for inventories in the amount of $1,698,337 and $218,236, respectively.  

When
recorded, inventory reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of inventories to their net realizable value. The Company
regularly evaluates the ability to realize the value of inventories based on a combination of factors including the following:
forecasted sales, estimated current and future market value. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, inventories reserve
of approximately $1,294,000 was reversed, which was reflected in cost of revenue. At September 30, 2016, the Company recorded
provisions to its inventory reserve of approximately $1,506,000, which was included in cost of revenue. The provisions for inventories
reserve were principally for slow moving frozen fish and marine catches. These frozen fish and marine catches were written down
to estimated realizable value . 

Advances
to suppliers   

Advances
to suppliers represent the cash paid in advance for the purchase of raw material from suppliers. The advance payments are intended
to ensure preferential pricing and delivery. According to related signed agreement, the Company has the right to receive refund
for these prepayments if the situation of demands and supplies changes. The amounts advanced under such arrangements totaled $34,735,933
and $35,994,146 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Receivable
from transferring equity method investment shares   

In
order to improve and focus on fishing business, the Company transferred 15% (RMB 150 million, approximately $23.3 million) of
the total ownership in Global Deep Ocean Fishing (Pingtan) Industrial Limited (the  Global Deep Ocean ) to another
shareholder of Global Deep Ocean in December 2015 (See note 7). In the second half of December 2015, the Company received RMB
50 million (approximately $7.8 million) from the transferee. As of December 31, 2015, the receivable resulting from the 15% ownership
transfer amounted to $15,406,659 (RMB 100 million). The receivable was collected in full in January and February 2016.

Fishing
licenses   

Each
of the Company s fishing vessels requires an approval from Ministry of Agriculture of the PRC to carry out ocean fishing
projects in foreign territories. These approvals are valid for a period from three to twelve months, and are awarded to the Company
at no cost. The Company applies for the renewal of the approval prior to expiration to avoid interruptions of fishing vessels 
operations. Each of the Company s fishing vessels operated in Indonesian waters requires a fishing license granted by the
authority in Indonesia .  

Investment
in unconsolidated company   Global Deep Ocean   

The
Company uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in, and earning or loss of, company that it does not control but
over which it does exert significant influence. The Company considers whether the fair value of its equity method investment has
declined below its carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded value may not be
recoverable. If the Company considers any decline to be other than temporary (based on various factors, including historical financial
results and the overall health of the investee), then a write-down would be recorded to estimated fair value. See Note 7
for discussion of equity method investment.  

Property,
plant and equipment   

Property,
plant and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets
are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses
are included in income in the year of disposition. The Company examines the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets
when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.  

Included
in property, plant and equipment are fishing vessels under construction which includes the costs of construction and any interest
charges arising from borrowings used to finance these assets during the period of construction of the assets. No provision for
depreciation is made on fishing vessels under construction until such time as the relevant assets are completed and ready for
their intended use.  

The
estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:  

Estimated useful life  
 
     Fishing vessels    
     10 - 20 Years  
 
     Vehicles    
     5 Years  
 
     Office and other equipment    
     3 - 5 Years  

Expenditures
 for repairs and maintenance, which do not extend the useful life of the assets, are expensed
as incurred .  

Capitalized
interest   

Interest
associated with the construction of fishing vessels is capitalized and included in the cost of the fishing vessels. When no debt
is incurred specifically for the construction of a fishing vessel, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the construction
using weighted-average cost of the Company s outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the construction
is substantially complete or the construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period. The Company capitalized interest
of $128,279 and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the fishing vessels under construction.
The Company capitalized interest of $544,984 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the
fishing vessels under construction.

Impairment
of long-lived assets   

In
accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an
impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount
of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its book value.  The
Company did not record any impairment charge for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Revenue
recognition   

Pursuant
to the guidance of ASC Topic 605 and ASC Topic 360, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is
reasonably assured. With respect to the sale of frozen fish and other marine catches to third party customers, most of which are
sole proprietor regional wholesalers in China, the Company recognizes revenue when customers pick up purchased goods at the Company s
cold storage warehouse, after payment is received by the Company or credit sale is approved by the Company for recurring customers
who have a history of financial responsibility. The Company does not offer promotional payments, customer coupons, rebates or
other cash redemption offers to its customers. The Company does not accept returns from customers.  

Government
grant   

Government
grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be
complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income over the periods necessary to match the grant
on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset, it is credited to the
cost of the asset and is released to the income statement over the expected useful life in a consistent manner with the depreciation
method for the relevant asset.  

Income
taxes   

Under
the current laws of the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands, the Company and Merchant Supreme are not subject to any income
or capital gains tax, and dividend payments that the Company may make are not subject to any withholding tax in the Cayman Islands
or British Virgin Islands. Under the current laws of Hong Kong, Prime Cheer is not subject to any capital gains tax and dividend
payments are not subject to any withholding tax in Hong Kong.  

The
Company is not incorporated nor does it engage in any trade or business in the United States and is not subject to United States
federal income taxes. The Company did not derive any significant amount of income subject to such taxes after completion of the
Share Exchange and accordingly, no relevant tax provision is made in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive (loss) income.  

The
Company's subsidiary, Pingtan Fishing, is a qualified ocean fishing enterprise certified by the Ministry of Agriculture of the
PRC. The qualification is renewed on April 1 each year. Pingtan Fishing is exempt from income tax derived from its ocean fishing
operations in the periods it processes a valid Ocean Fishing Enterprise Qualification Certificate issued by the Ministry of Agriculture
of the PRC.

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   

Income
taxes (continued)   

The
new China s Enterprise Income Tax Law ( EIT Law ) also provides that an enterprise established under the laws
of foreign countries or regions but whose  de facto management body  is located in the PRC be treated as a resident
enterprise for PRC tax purposes and consequently be subject to the PRC income tax at the rate of 25% for its worldwide income.
The Implementing Rules of the new EIT Law merely defines the location of the  de facto management body  as  the
place where the exercising, in substance, of the overall management and control of the production and business operation, personnel,
accounting, properties, etc., of a non-PRC company is located.  On April 22, 2009, the PRC State Administration of Taxation
further issued a notice entitled  Notice Regarding Recognizing Offshore-Established Enterprises Controlled by PRC Shareholders
as Resident Enterprises Based on Their Place of Effective Management.  Under this notice, a foreign company controlled by
a PRC company or a group of PRC companies shall be deemed as a PRC resident enterprise if (i) the senior management and the core
management departments in charge of its daily operations mainly function in the PRC; (ii) its financial decisions and human resource
decisions are subject to decisions or approvals of persons or institutions in the PRC; (iii) its major assets, accounting books,
company seals, minutes and files of board meetings and shareholders  meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv) more
than half of the directors or senior management personnel with voting rights reside in the PRC. Based on a review of surrounding
facts and circumstances, the company does not believe that it is likely that its operations outside of the PRC should be considered
a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, due to limited guidance and implementation history of the new EIT Law, should
the Company be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, the Company will be subject to PRC tax on worldwide income
at a uniform tax rate of 25% retroactive to May 3, 2012.  

In
addition, Pingtan Fishing is not subject to foreign income taxes for its operations in either India and Indonesia Exclusive Economic
Zones or the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission areas.  

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be effective when the differences are expected
to reverse.  

Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income
in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The
Company has not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of the subsidiaries located in the PRC because
it is the present intention of management to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely in PRC. The cumulative undistributed
earnings from PRC subsidiaries amounted to approximately $170.2 million and $190.5 million as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively, which are included in consolidated retained earnings. Generally, such earnings become subject to the PRC
tax upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred
tax liability on such undistributed earnings.     

The
Company prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
in the tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification
of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions,
accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there
were no amounts that had been accrued with respect to uncertain tax positions.  

Shipping
and handling costs   

Shipping
and handling costs are included in selling expense and totaled $8,399 and $56,321 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. Shipping and handling costs totaled $97,786 and $285,786 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.

The
Company makes mandatory contributions to the PRC government s health, retirement benefit and unemployment funds in accordance
with the relevant Chinese social security laws. The costs of these payments are charged to the same accounts as the related salary
costs in the same period as the related salary costs incurred. Employee benefit costs totaled $47,727 and $215,537 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Employee benefit costs totaled $223,123 and $690,563 for the nine

Advertising   

Advertising
is expensed as incurred and is included in selling expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
(loss) income. The Company did not incur any advertising expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Advertising
totaled $27,414 and $90,372 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Research
and development   

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense. The Company did not incur
any research and development costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Foreign
currency translation   

The
reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the parent company and subsidiaries of Merchant
Supreme and Prime Cheer is the U.S. dollar and the functional currency of the Company s subsidiaries of Pingtan Guansheng,
Fujian Heyue and Pingtan Fishing is the Chinese Renminbi ( RMB ). For the subsidiaries of Pingtan Guansheng, Fujian
Heyue and Pingtan Fishing, whose functional currencies are the RMB, results of operations and cash flows are translated at average
exchange rates during the period, assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate at the end of the period,
and equity is translated at historical exchange rates. As a result, amounts relating to assets and liabilities reported on the
statements of cash flows may not necessarily agree with the changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheets. Translation
adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in
determining comprehensive income. The cumulative translation adjustment and effect of exchange rate changes on cash for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $(284,053) and $(44,484), respectively. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance
sheet date with any transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency
other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred.  

All
of the Company s revenue transactions are transacted in the functional currency of the operating subsidiaries. The Company
does not enter into any material transaction in foreign currencies. Transaction gains or losses have not had, and are not expected
to have, a material effect on the results of operations of the Company.  

The
foreign currency exchange rates were obtained from www.oanda.com. Asset and liability accounts at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 were translated at 6.6694 RMB to $1.00 and at 6.4907 RMB to $1.00, respectively, which were the exchange rates on the
balance sheet dates. Equity accounts were stated at their historical rate. The average translation rates applied to the statements
of   operations and comprehensive (loss) income
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 6.5792 RMB and 6.1606 RMB to
$1.00, respectively. Cash flows from the Company s operations are calculated based upon the local currencies using the average
translation rate.   

Earnings (loss) per share  

ASC Topic
260  Earnings per Share,  requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share ( EPS )
with a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted
EPS computation. Basic EPS excludes dilution. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that
then shared in the earnings of the entity.

Earnings
per share (continued)   

Basic
earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net (loss) income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net
(loss) income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities
outstanding during each period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of the common shares issuable upon the exercise of
common stock warrants (using the treasury stock method). Common stock equivalents are not included in the calculation of diluted
earnings (loss) per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive. In a period in which the Company has a net loss, all potentially
dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding as they would have had an anti-dilutive impact. The
following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted net (loss) income per share:  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, warrants to purchase 8,966,667 shares of ordinary stock have
not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share in order to avoid any anti-dilutive effect.  

Non-controlling
interest   

On
February 15, 2015, China Agriculture invested RMB 400 million (approximately $65 million) into Pingtan Fishing and acquired an
8% equity interest in Pingtan Fishing. As of September 30, 2016, China Agriculture owned 8% of the equity interest of Pingtan
Fishing, which was not under the Company s control.  

Related
parties   

Parties
are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company,
its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with
which the Company may deal with if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the
other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The
Company discloses all significant related party transactions.  

Comprehensive
(loss) income   

Comprehensive
(loss) income is comprised of net (loss) income and all changes to the statements of stockholders  equity, except those
due to investments by stockholders, changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders. For the Company, comprehensive
(loss) income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included net (loss) income and unrealized loss from
foreign currency translation adjustments.

Commitments
and contingencies   

In
the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, including legal proceedings and environmental claims arising
out of the normal course of businesses that relate to a wide range of matters, including among others, contracts breach liability.
The Company records accruals for such contingencies based upon the assessment of the probability of occurrence and, where determinable,
an estimate of the liability. Management may consider many factors in making these assessments including past history, scientific
evidence and the specifics of each matter.  

The
Company s management has evaluated all such proceedings and claims that existed as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s
financial position, liquidity or results of operations.  

Concentrations
of credit, economic and political risks   

The
Company s operations are carried out in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the PRC, and by the general state of the PRC s
economy. The Company s operation in the PRC is subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated
with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic
and legal environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political
and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary
measures, currency conversion, remittances aboard, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.  

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts
receivable. All of the Company s cash is maintained with state-owned banks within the PRC and Hong Kong, and none of these
deposits are covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed
to any risks on its cash in bank accounts. A portion of the Company s sales are credit sales which are primarily to customers
whose abilities to pay are dependent upon the industry economics prevailing in these areas; however, concentrations of credit
risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is limited due to generally short payment terms. The Company also performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers to help further reduce credit risk.  

According
to the sale agreement signed on December 4, 2013, the Company does not own 20 fishing vessels but has the leased operating rights
to operate these vessels which are owned by a related company, Fuzhou Honglong Ocean Fishery Co., Ltd ( Hong Long )
and the Company is entitled to 100% of net profit (loss) of the vessels. The Company has latitude in establishing price and discretion
in supplier selection. There were no economic risks associated with the leased operating rights but the Company may need to bear
the operation risks and credit risks as aforementioned.  

As
the Company has historically derived the majority of its revenue from Indonesian waters, the suspension of fishing operation in
this area has had and will continue to have a significant negative impact on the Compan y. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

In
August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the
classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt
instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance
claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must
adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact it may have on its consolidated
financial statements.

6    COST METHOD INVESTMENT   

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cost method investment amounted to $3,148,709 and $3,235,398, respectively. The investment
represents the Company s subsidiary, Pingtan Fishing s minority interest in Fujian Pingtan Rural-Commercial Bank Joint-Stock
Co., Ltd. ( Pingtan Rural-Commercial Bank  ), a private financial institution. Pingtan Fishing completed its
registration as a shareholder on October 17, 2012 and paid RMB 21 million (approximately $3.1 million) to subscribe 5% of the
common stock of Pingtan Rural-Commercial Bank. Pingtan Fishing held 15,113,250 shares and accounted for 4.8% investment in the
total equity investment of the bank as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

In
according to ASC 325, the Company uses the cost method of accounting to record its investment since Pingtan Fishing does not have
the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financing activities of Pingtan Rural-Commercial Bank. Long-term
investment for which there are no quoted market prices, a reasonable estimate of fair value could not be made without incurring
excessive costs. The Company monitors its investment in the non-marketable security and will recognize, if ever existing, a loss
in value which is deemed to be other than temporary. The Company determined that there was no impairment on this investment as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Overview  

We are a marine
enterprises group primarily engaging in ocean fishing through our PRC operating subsidiary, Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean
Fishing Group Co., Ltd., or Pingtan Fishing. We harvest a variety of fish species with many of our-owned or licensed vessels operating
within the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone, the Arafura Sea of Indonesia and the Western and Central Pacific Ocean of the international
waters. We provide high quality seafood to a diverse group of customers including distributors, restaurant owners and exporters
in the PRC.  

In June 2013,
we expanded our fleet from 40 to 86 vessels through a purchase of 46 fishing trawlers for a total consideration of $410.1 million.
We began operating these vessels in the third quarter of 2013 and have been entitled to net profits from their operation. Each
vessel carries a crew of 10 to 15 persons. These vessels have resulted in additional carrying capacity of approximately 45,000
to 50,000 tons of fish.  

In September
2013, we further increased our fleet to 106 vessels with the acquisition of 20 newly-built fishing trawlers. At full operation,
each vessel is capable of harvesting 900 to 1,000 tons of fish.  

On December 4,
2013, in connection with the sale of CDGC to Hong Long, a related party, we acquired 25-year operating license rights in connection
with the lease of 20 fishing drifters for the appraised fair market value of approximately $216.1 million, whereby we are entitled
to 100% of the operations and net profits (losses) from the vessels for the term of the lease.  

In September
2014, we further expanded our fleet to 129 vessels with the addition of 3 newly-built fishing trawlers. At full operation, each
vessel is capable of harvesting 2,000 tons of fish.  

In June 2015,
we purchased 4 longline fishing vessels and 2 squid jigging vessels for the appraised fair market value of approximately $56.2
million. These vessels are primarily focused on catching tuna and squid.  

As of September
30, 2016, we own 107 trawlers, 4 longline fishing vessels, 2 squid jigging vessels and 2 drifters and have exclusive operating
license rights to 20 drifters. We are the second largest China based fishery company operating its vessels outside of China waters
and our fleet has an average remaining useful life of approximately 11 years. These vessels are fully licensed to fish in Indonesian,
Indian, or Western and Central Pacific Ocean of the international waters.  

Among the 135
fishing vessels, 13 vessels have obtained fishing licenses from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of Democratic
Republic of Timor-Leste and will operate in the sea area of Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste; 12 vessels are operating in
the Bay of Bengal in India; 6 vessels are licensed to operate in Western and Central Pacific Ocean of the international waters, and
will be replaced by 6 new vessels which are under construction; and the remaining vessels are licensed to operate in the Arafura
Sea in Indonesia but temporarily not operating due to the moratorium discussed below.  

The 13 Timor-Leste licensed vessels
have completed their modification process to change their fishing method in order to meet the local requirements, and are on the
way to their operating destination in the sea of Timor-Leste. We expect to put these vessels in full operation by the end of 2016. 

We catch nearly
30 different species of fish including ribbon fish, Indian white shrimp, croaker fish, pomfret, Spanish mackerel, conger eel, squid
and red snapper. All of our catch is shipped back to China. Our fishing vessels transport frozen catch to a cold storage warehouse
which is nearby onshore fishing bases. We then arrange chartered transportation ships to deliver frozen stocks to cold storage
warehouses located in one of China s largest seafood trading centers, Mawei Seafood Market in Fujian Province.  

We derive our
revenue primarily from the sale of frozen seafood products. We sell our products directly to customers including distributors,
restaurant owners and exporters. Most of our customers have long-term, cooperative relationships with us. Our existing customers
also introduce new customers to us from time to time. Our operating results are subject to seasonal variations. Harvest volume
is the highest in the fourth quarter of the year while harvest volumes in the second and third quarters are relatively low due
to the spawn season of certain fish species, including ribbon fish, cuttlefish, pomfret, and calamari. Based on past experiences,
demand for seafood products is the highest from December to January, during Chinese New Year. We believe that our profitability
and growth are dependent on the termination of the Indonesian moratorium discussed below and our ability to expand our customer
base.  

Significant factors affecting our results of operations  

The Indonesian
    government's moratorium on fishing licenses renewals:    In
    early December 2014, the Indonesian government introduced a six-month moratorium on issuing new fishing licenses and
    renewals     so that the country s Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries ( MMAF ) could monitor the
    operations of     existing fleets and to fight illegal fishing activities. As a result, all licensed fishing vessels
    operating in Indonesian     waters have been informed by the Indonesian government to operate within strict guidelines and
    subsequently to cease operation,     in order to avoid potential enforcement actions, such as boat seizures, by the
    Indonesian Navy. To cooperate and comply with     the Indonesian government s fishing license check procedures, in
    January 2015, we lowered our operation to approximately     half of our normal level. Since February 2015, we have ceased
    operations in the Indonesian waters. Since we derive a majority     of our revenue from this area, this ban has caused a
    significant drop in our production. In November 2015, the Indonesian     government announced that the moratorium had
    concluded. Our expectation is that the MMAF will implement new fishing policies     and resume the license renewal process
    although this has not yet occurred. In the interim, our financial results will continue     to be materially adversely
    affected by this moratorium. To satisfy our customers  demand, we purchased fish from a third     party and resold  it
    to our customers which generated a positive gross margin. The positive gross margin in the reselling activities
    partially     offset the decrease in our overall gross margin for the nine months ended September 30,
    2016.    

Governmental
    policies:   Fishing is a highly regulated industry and our
    operations require licenses and permits. Our ability to obtain, sustain or renew such licenses and permits on acceptable terms
    is subject to changes in regulations and policies and is at the discretion of the applicable government agencies. Our inability
    to obtain, or loss or denial of extensions to, any of our applicable licenses or permits could hamper our ability to generate
    revenue from our operations.    

Resource
      environmental factors:   Our fishing expeditions are
    based in India and Indonesia and Western and Central Pacific Ocean of the international waters. Any earthquake, tsunami, adverse
    weather or oceanic conditions or other calamities in such areas may result in disruption to our operations and could adversely
    affect our sales. Adverse weather conditions such as storms, cyclones and typhoons or cataclysmic events may also decrease
    the volume of fish catches or may even hamper our operations. Our fishing volumes may also be adversely affected by major
    climatic disruptions such as El Nino, which in the past has caused significant decreases in seafood catch worldwide. Besides
    weather patterns, other unpredictable factors, such as fish migration, may also have impact our harvest volume.    

Fluctuation
    on fuel prices:   Our operations may be adversely affected
    by fluctuations in fuel prices. Changes in fuel prices may result in increases in the selling prices of our products, and
    may, in turn, adversely affect our sales volume, revenue and operating profit.    

Competition:   We
    engage in the business in the Arafura Sea of Indonesia, the Bay of Bengal in India and the Western and Central Pacific Ocean
    of the international waters. Competition within our dedicated fishing areas is not currently significant as the region is
    not overfished or regulated by government limits on the number of vessels that are allowed to fish in the territories; however,
    there is no guarantee that competition will not become more intense. Competition in the consumer market in China, however,
    is keen. We compete with other fishing companies which offer similar and varied products. There is significant demand for
    fish in the Chinese market. We believe our catch appeals to a wide segment of consumers because of the low price points of
    our products.    

Fishing
    licenses:   Each of our fishing vessels requires approval from
    the Ministry of Agriculture of the People s Republic of China to carry out ocean fishing projects in foreign territories.
    These approvals are valid for a period of three to twelve months, and are awarded to us at no cost. We apply for the renewal
    of the approval prior to expiration to avoid interruptions of our fishing vessels  operations. Each of our fishing vessels
    operating in Indonesian waters requires a fishing license granted by the authority in Indonesia.     

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Comparison of results of operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenue   

We recognize
revenue from sales of frozen fish and other marine catches when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred,
the price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured . 

With
respect to the sales to third party customers the majority of whom are sole proprietor regional wholesalers in the PRC, we recognize
revenue when customers receive purchased goods at our cold storage warehouse, after payment is received or credit sale is approved
for recurring customers with excellent payment histories . 

We do not offer
promotional payments, customer coupons, rebates or other cash redemption offers to customers. We do not accept returns from customers.
Deposits or advance payments from customers prior to delivery of goods are recorded as advances from customers . 

For the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our revenue by species of fish was as follows (dollars in thousands, except for average price) : 

For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our revenue by species of fish was as follows (dollars in thousands, except for average price) : 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had revenue of $1,168,946, as compared to revenue of $2,740,981 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1,572,035, or 57.4%. Sales volumes in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased
50.7% to 459,689 kg from 932,530 kg in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Average unit sale price decreased 13.6% in the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, which was primarily due to the
different sales mix.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had revenue of $7,388,395, as compared to revenue of $46,727,808 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $39,339,413, or 84.2%. Sales volumes in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased
81.9% to 2,953,215 kg from 16,319,180 kg in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Average unit sale price decreased 12.6% in
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was primarily due to the
different sales mix.  

Our
decrease in revenue is attributable to the fact that, in early December 2014, the Indonesian government introduced a six-month
moratorium on issuing new fishing licenses and renewals so that the country s Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries
( MMAF ) could monitor the operations of existing fleets and to fight illegal fishing activities. As a result, all
licensed fishing vessels operating in the Indonesian waters have been informed by the Indonesian government to operate within strict
guidelines and subsequently to cease operation, in order to avoid potential enforcement actions, such as boat seizures, by the
Indonesian Navy. We have ceased operations in the Indonesian waters since February 2015.  

Since we derive a majority of our revenue
from this area, this temporary ban has caused a significant drop in our production. As a result, our sales for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 decreased significantly as compared to the comparable periods in 2015. In November 2015, the Indonesian
government announced that the moratorium had concluded. Our expectation is that the MMAF will implement new fishing policies and
resume the license renewal process although this has not yet occurred. In the interim, our financial results will continue to
be materially adversely affected by this moratorium. To satisfy our customers  demand, we purchased fish from a third party
and resold it to our customers which generated a positive gross margin. The positive gross margin in the reselling activities
partially offset the decrease in our overall gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Cost of revenue   

Our cost of revenue
primarily consists of change in inventories reserve, fuel costs, freight, direct labor costs, depreciation, fishing vessels maintenance
fees, other overhead costs, and purchase cost for reselling fish. Fuel costs, depreciation and labor costs generally accounted
for the majority of our cost of revenue. The following table sets forth our cost of revenue information, both in amounts and as
a percentage of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands ) : 

*Represents translation adjustment which reflects changes
in the currency exchange ratio. 

The following
table sets forth our cost of revenue information, both in amounts and as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands ): 

*Represents the cost of fish purchased from third parties
to satisfy our customers  demand. 

Cost of revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $13,481,775, representing an increase of $4,233,079 or 45.8% as compared to $9,248,696
for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in our fuel cost
and depreciation, offset by the adjustment from inventories reserve reversal. Cost of revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $26,054,703, representing a decrease of $14,507,948 or 35.8% as compared to $40,562,651 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in our revenue, offset by the increase in our unit
production cost.  

Gross (loss) profit   

Our gross (loss)
profit is affected primarily by change in inventories reserve, changes in production costs and purchase price for our reselling
fish. Fuel cost, depreciation, labor cost, and change in inventories reserve together account for about 97.6% and 51.2% of cost
of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fuel cost, depreciation, labor cost, and change
in inventories reserve together account for about 94.0% and 72.3% of cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. The change in inventories reserve and the fluctuation of fuel price, and unit purchase price for fish which
we purchase from a third party to resell to our customers may significantly affect our cost level and gross (loss) profit . 

The following
table sets forth information as to our revenue, cost of revenue, gross (loss) profit and gross margin for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 . 

Gross loss for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $12,312,829, representing a change of $5,805,114 or 89.2% as compared to gross loss
of $6,507,715 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to the moratorium described elsewhere in this report. Gross margin
decreased to (1,053.3)% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from (237.4)% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Gross loss for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $18,666,308, representing a change of $24,831,465 or 402.8% as compared to gross profit
of $6,165,157 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to the moratorium described elsewhere in this report. Gross margin
decreased to (252.6)% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 13.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
significant decrease in gross margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to the change in inventories reserve, the reduced scale of operations
resulting in lower revenue, which is reflected in the allocation of fixed costs, mainly consisting of depreciation, compared to
cost of revenue; partially offset by the positive gross margin from our fish resale activities. We expect that our gross margin
will continue to be negative in the rest of 2016 and we can only improve our gross margin by increasing our production . 

Selling expense   

Our selling expense
mainly includes storage fees, insurance, shipping and handling fees, customs service charge, advertising expenses, and fishing
vessels  examination fees. Our sales activities are conducted through direct selling by our internal sales staff. Because
of the strong demand for our products and services, we do not have to aggressively market and distribute our products. As a result,
our selling expense has been relatively small as a percentage of our revenue . 

Selling expense
totaled $93,843 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $312,574 for the three months ended September 30,
2015, a decrease of $218,731 or 70.0%. Selling expense totaled $508,062 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to $1,309,859 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $801,797 or 61.2%. Selling expense as a percentage of
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 8.0% from 11.4% for comparable period in 2015, which was mainly
attributable to the decrease in insurance cost for fishing vessels and the decrease in storage fees resulting from the decreased
storage area. Selling expense as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to 6.9% from 2.8%
for corresponding period in 2015, which was mainly attributable to the significant decrease in sales revenue due to the Indonesian
government s moratorium described in elsewhere in this report and slight change in insurance cost period over period. Selling
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following : 

General and administrative expense   

General and administrative
expense totaled $660,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $733,923 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of $73,223 or 10.0%. General and administrative expense totaled $3,038,984 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, as compared to $2,547,225 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $491,759 or 19.3%. General and
administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following : 

Compensation
    and related benefits remained roughly consistent for the three  and nine
    months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.    

Professional
    fees, which primarily consist of legal fees, accounting fees, investor relations services charge, valuation service fees and
    other fees associated with being a public company, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $17,377, or
    8.2%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2016
    was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal fees of approximately $26,000, offset by an increase in other miscellaneous
    items of approximately $9,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, professional fees decreased by $121,920, or 12.7%,
    as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily
    attributable to a decrease in valuation service fees of approximately $105,000, a decrease in accounting fees of approximately
    $60,000, and a decrease in investor relations services charge of approximately $18,000, offset by an increase in legal fees
    of approximately $51,000, and an increase in other miscellaneous items of approximately $10,000.   

Rent
    and related administrative service charge remained consistent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
    to the corresponding periods in 2015.   

For
    the three months ended September 30, 2016, travel and entertainment expense increased by $48,310, or 332.3% as compared to
    the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, travel and entertainment expense
    increased by $20,930, or 25.2%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable
    to an increase in travel for investor conferences.   

Insurance
    for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $358,310 as compared to the comparable period in 2015. The increase
    in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly attributable to the increase in officer and director liability insurance
    of approximately $358,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015.   

Other
    general and administrative expense, which primarily consist of communication fees, office supply, miscellaneous taxes, bank
    service charge, depreciation, and NASDAQ listing fee. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, other general and administrative
    expense decreased by $93,797, or 87.6%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, due to stricter control
    in corporation spending. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, other general and administrative expense increased
    by $269,614, or 126.3%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to an
    increase in depreciation of approximately $317,000, offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous items of approximately $47,000.
    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our 13 upgraded and renovated fishing vessels were temporary idle. We recorded
    the related depreciation for these 13 fishing vessels as operating expenses rather than as cost of revenue. Therefore, the
    depreciation for operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased as compared to the corresponding
    period in 2015.    

(Loss) income from operations   

As a result of
the factors described above, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, loss from operations amounted to $13,067,372, as compared
to loss from operations of $7,554,212 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $5,513,160, or 73.0%. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, loss from operations amounted to $22,213,354, as compared to income from operations of $2,308,073
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $24,521,427, or 1,062.4%.  

Other income (expense)   

Other income/expense
mainly include interest income from bank deposits, interest expense generated from short-term and long-term bank borrowings, foreign
currency transaction loss, grant income from Chinese government, gain (loss) from cost method investment, loss on equity method
investment, and loss on fixed assets disposal . 

For the three
months ended September 30, 2016, other expense, net, amounted to $831,207 as compared to other income, net, of $30,072,336 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $30,903,543, or 102.8%, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in
grant income from Chinese government of approximately $31,691,000, offset by a decrease in foreign currency transaction loss of
approximately $689,000, a decrease in interest expense of approximately $79,000 mainly due to the decrease in our interest bearing
bank loans, and a decrease in loss on equity method investment of approximately $27,000.  

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, other expense, net, amounted to $1,688,375 as compared to other income, net, of
$27,054,324 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $28,742,699, or 106.2%, which was primarily
attributable to a decrease in grant income from the Chinese government of approximately $31,538,000, a decrease in interest
income of approximately $95,000, a decrease in gain from cost method investment of approximately $38,000, offset by a
decrease in interest expense of approximately $1,200,000 mainly due to the decrease in our interest bearing bank loans, a
decrease in foreign currency transaction loss of approximately $172,000, a decrease in loss on equity method investment of
approximately $12,000, and a decrease in loss on fixed assets disposal of approximately $1,544,000.  

The grant income
represents an incentive granted by the Chinese government to encourage the development of ocean fishing industry in order to satisfy
the demand of natural seafood in China.  

Income taxes   

We
are exempted from income taxes for income generated from our ocean fishing operations in China for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income taxes expense was $993 which was generated
by taxable income from fish reselling activities. Since February 2015, we have temporarily ceased fishing operations in Indonesian
waters due to the Indonesian government s moratorium described in elsewhere in this report. In order to satisfy our customers 
demand, we purchased fish from a third party and resold to our customers. We are required to pay income taxes for our fish reselling
operations . 

Net (loss) income   

As a result of
the factors described above, our net loss was $13,898,579 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with net income
of $22,518,124 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $36,416,703 or 161.7%. Our net loss was $23,902,722 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with net income of $29,362,397 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
a change of $53,265,119 or 181.4%.  

Net (loss) income attributable to owners of the
Company   

The
net loss attributable to owners of the Company was $12,823,402, or $(0.16) per ordinary share (basic and diluted) for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with net income attributable to owners of the Company of $20,683,627, or $0.26 per
ordinary share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $33,507,029 or 162.0%.  

The
net loss attributable to owners of the Company was $22,152,230, or $(0.28) per ordinary share (basic and diluted) for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with net income attributable to owners of the Company of $27,436,954, or $0.35 per
ordinary share (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $49,589,184 or 180.7%.  

Foreign currency translation adjustment   

Our reporting
currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our parent company and subsidiaries of Merchant Supreme and Prime Cheer
is the U.S. dollar and the functional currency of the Company s subsidiaries which are incorporated in China is the Chinese
Renminbi ( RMB ). The financial statements of our subsidiaries which are incorporated in China are translated to U.S.
dollars using period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange (for the period) for revenue,
costs, and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in the consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. As a result of foreign currency translations, which are a non-cash adjustment, we
reported a foreign currency translation loss of $459,166 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to foreign
currency translation loss of $6,948,652 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We reported a foreign currency translation
loss of $3,831,852 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to foreign currency translation loss of $5,848,277
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This non-cash loss had the effect of increasing/decreasing our reported comprehensive
loss/gain . 

Comprehensive (loss) income   

As a result of
our foreign currency translation adjustment, we had comprehensive loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $14,357,745,
compared to comprehensive income of $15,569,472 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We had comprehensive loss for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $27,734,574, compared to comprehensive income of $23,514,120 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 . 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise
operate on an ongoing basis. Our principal liquidity demands are based on the capital needs of Pingtan Fishing related to the
acquisition or construction of new fishing vessels and continuously upgrading and renovating existing vessels, and our general
corporate purposes. We historically relied on cash flow provided by operations and bank loans to supplement our working capital.
We also receive government grants as the government incentive for encouraging development of ocean fishing industry. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash balances of approximately $568,000 and $11,449,000, respectively. The significant
portion of these funds are located in financial institutions located in the PRC and will continue to be indefinitely reinvested
in our operations in the PRC . 

The following
table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 : 

Our working
capital decreased $57,677,749 to working capital deficit of $8,198,642 at September 30, 2016 from working capital of $49,479,107
at December 31, 2015. This decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash of approximately $10,881,000,
a decrease in accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, of approximately $9,435,000, primarily due to the significant
decrease in revenue, a decrease in advances to suppliers of approximately $1,258,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses   related
parties of approximately $3,512,000, mainly due to the decrease in prepaid fuel costs to our related parties, a significant decrease
in receivable from transferring equity method investment shares of approximately $15,407,000 resulting from the repayments received
in 2016, a decrease in other receivables - related parties of approximately $5,458,000 mainly due to the repayments received from
related parties in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase in short-term bank loans of approximately $4,177,000
resulting from the increase in working capital advances from banks, an increase in long-term bank loans   current portion
of approximately $2,419,000, and an increase in accrued liabilities and other payables of approximately $783,000, and an increase
in due to related parties of approximately $7,230,000 resulting from the significant increase in payments made by our relate party
on behalf of us to our vendors, offset by an increase in restricted cash of approximately $2,462,000 to secure our short term
bank loans, and a decrease in accounts payable   related parties of approximately $304,000.  

Because the exchange
rate conversion is different for consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows, the changes in assets and
liabilities reflected on consolidated statements of cash flows are not necessarily identical with the comparable changes reflected
on consolidated balance sheets.  

Cash flows for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015   

The  following
summarizes the key components of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 : 

Net cash flow
provided by operating activities was $3,034,888 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash flow provided
by operating activities of $45,388,993 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $42,354,105 . 

Net  cash
flow provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflected the add-back of non-cash
items, consisting of depreciation of approximately $4,769,000, increase in reserve for inventories of approximately $1,506,000,
and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisting of  a significant decrease in accounts receivable
of approximately $9,335,000 mainly due to the collections made in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease in advances
to suppliers of approximately $298,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses   related parties of approximately $3,434,000 primarily
due to the decrease in prepayments for fuel costs made to our related parties, an increase in accrued liabilities and other payables
of approximately $930,000, and an increase in due to related parties of approximately $8,709,000 mainly due to the significant
increase in payments made by our related party on behalf of us to our vendors, offset by our net loss of approximately $23,903,000,
and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisting of an increase in inventories of approximately $1,520,000

decrease in accounts payable   related parties of approximately $297,000.   

Net  cash flow provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflected net income of approximately $29,362,000 and the add-back of non-cash items mainly consisting of depreciation of approximately $4,360,000, and a loss on disposal of fixed assets of approximately $1,544,000, and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily consisting of a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately $39,366,000 due to the significant decrease in revenue and collections made, a decrease in inventories of approximately $6,467,000 mainly due to the decreased fishing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease in deferred expenses   related parties of approximately $978,000, a decrease in other receivable   related parties of approximately $4,384,000 due to payments received from related parties, an increase in accounts payable   related parties of approximately $2,625,000, and an increase in accrued liabilities and other payables of approximately $3,971,000, offset by an significant increase in advances to suppliers of approximately $35,352,000 in order to satisfy our customers  demand, an increase in prepaid expenses of approximately $4,475,000 mainly due to the prepayments made for fishing nets and spare parts, an increase in prepaid expenses   related parties of approximately $7,684,000 primarily due to prepayments made for fuel and other items, and a decrease in advances from customers of approximately $164,000 .  

Net cash flow
used in investing activities was $30,088,716 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash flow used in
investing activities of $18,189,427 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we made payments for purchase of property, plant and equipment of approximately $959,000, and made prepayments for long-term assets
of approximately $44,329,000, offset by proceeds received from transferring equity method investment share of approximately $15,199,000.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we made the payments for equity method investment of approximately $40,580,000
and made payments for purchase of property, plant and equipment of approximately $16,000, offset by refunds received from commercial
retail space prepayments of approximately $22,407,000.  

Net cash flow
provided by financing activities was $16,457,128 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash flow used
in financing activities of $18,815,044 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we received proceeds from short-term bank loans of approximately $19,000,000, proceeds from long-term bank loans of approximately
$19,000,000, and advances from related parties of approximately $3,754,000, offset by repayments of short-term bank loans of approximately
$14,169,000, repayments of long-term bank loans of approximately $6,217,000, increase in restricted cash of approximately $2,538,000,
and payments made for dividend of approximately $2,372,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we acquired fishing
vessels from related parties under common control of approximately $56,206,000, repaid short-term bank loans of approximately $16,250,000,
repaid long-term bank loans of approximately $14,256,000, made cash dividend of approximately $1,581,000, and made payments to
related parties in connection with the termination of VIE structure (See Note 10) of approximately $13,473,000 which will be returned
to the Company in next 12 months, offset by proceeds from short-term bank loans of approximately $15,472,000, advances from related
parties of approximately $2,550,000 and received capital contribution from non-controlling interest of approximately $64,929,000.  

We have
historically funded our capital expenditures through cash flow provided by operations, bank loans and related parties  advances.
As of September 30, 2016, we have contractual commitments of RMB 2 million (approximately $300,000) related to an equity investment
commitment, and RMB 8.5 million (approximately $1,274,000) related to 4 fishing vessels construction commitment. We intend to
fund the costs with cash flow from our operations and by obtaining financing mainly from local banking institutions with which
we have done business in the past. We believe that the relationships with local banks are in good standing. And we have not encountered
difficulties in obtaining needed borrowings from local banks. We believe that our available cash together with our cash flow from
operations and secured bank financing and/or other third party financing will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements
for the next twelve months.  

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

Contractual obligations   

We have certain
fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation
provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide
certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used
in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context
of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  

The following
tables summarize our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands), and the effect these obligations
are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.  

(1) Historically,  we
have refinanced these short-term bank loans for an additional term of six months to one year and we expect to continue to refinance
these loans upon  expiration. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements   

None. 

Recent accounting pronouncements  

In August 2016,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the classification of
certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent
consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims and distributions
received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments
in the same period. We are currently evaluating the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements.  

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

Commodity price risk  

Oil cost accounts
for approximately 75.2% and 61.8% of our total cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. We are primarily
exposed to oil price volatility caused by supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors.
We purchase oil used by our vessels at prevailing market prices. We do not have formal long-term purchase contracts with our suppliers
and, therefore, we are exposed to the risk of fluctuating oil prices . 

We did not have
any commodity price derivatives or hedging arrangements outstanding at September 30, 2016 and did not employ any commodity price
derivatives in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Foreign currency exchange rate risk  

While our reporting
currency is the USD, all of our consolidated revenue and consolidated cost of revenue and a significant portion of our consolidated
expenses are denominated in RMB. Furthermore, a significant portion of our assets are denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed
to foreign exchange risk as our revenue and result of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between USD
and RMB.   

The value of
the RMB against the USD and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC s political and economic
conditions. Since July 2005, the RMB has not been pegged to the USD. Although the People s Bank of China regularly intervenes
in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate
significantly in value against the USD in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, PRC authorities
may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market . 

If
the RMB depreciates against the USD, the value of our RMB revenue, earnings and assets as expressed in our USD financial statements
will decline. A 1% average appreciation (depreciation) of the RMB against the USD would decrease (increase) our comprehensive loss
by $277,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 based on our revenue, costs and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated
in RMB as of September 30, 2016. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to foreign currency
exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these
hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at  all. 

Interest rate risk  

We are exposed
to interest rate risk arising from short-term and long-term variable rate borrowings from time to time. Our future interest expense
will fluctuate in line with any change in our borrowing rates. Our bank borrowings amounted to $73.1 million at September 30, 2016.
Based on the variable nature of the underlying interest rate, the bank borrowings approximated fair value at that date.  

A hypothetical
100 basis point change in interest rates would impact our earnings and cash flows by approximately $20,000. The potential change
in cash flows and earnings is calculated based on the change in the net interest expense over a one year period due to an immediate
100 basis point change in interest rates.  

Inflation risk  

Inflationary
factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we
do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate
of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling and
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with
these increased costs . 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility
of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls
and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  

In  connection
with the preparation of the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures, which are defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer
in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure . 

Based on this
evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30,
2016 due to the material weakness we reported in our 2015 10-K which has not yet been remediated. In our 2015 10-K we reported
that we did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of experience and training in the application
of U.S. GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements .  

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  

There were no
changes (including corrective actions with regard to material weakness) in our internal controls over financial reporting that
occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting . 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

We are not currently a party to any lawsuit or proceeding
which, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on us or our business. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

Factors that
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 9, 2016. You should also carefully consider the
following risk associated with an investment in our publicly traded securities. Any of these factors could result in a significant
or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to
us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.  

The Indonesian government moratorium on fishing
licenses renewals   

In
early December 2014, the Indonesian government introduced a six-month moratorium on issuing new fishing licenses and renewals
so that the country s Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries ( MMAF ) could monitor the operations of existing
fleets and to fight illegal fishing activities. As a result, all licensed fishing vessels operating in Indonesian waters have
been informed by the Indonesian government to operate within strict guidelines and subsequently to cease operation, in order to
avoid potential enforcement actions, such as boat seizures, by the Indonesian Navy. To cooperate and comply with the Indonesian
government s fishing license check procedures, in January 2015, we lowered our operation to approximately half of our normal
level. Since February 2015, we have ceased operations in the Indonesian waters. Since we derive a majority of our revenue from
this area, this temporary ban has caused a significant drop in our production. In November 2015, the Indonesian government announced
that the moratorium had concluded. Our expectation is that the MMAF will implement new fishing policies and resume the license
renewal process although this has not yet occurred. In the interim, our financial results will continue to be materially adversely
affected by this moratorium. To satisfy our customers  demand, we purchased fish from a third party and resold it to our
customers which generated a positive gross margin. The positive gross margin in the reselling activities partially offset the
decrease in our overall gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 .
