NOTE 1.   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS  
   
   Terms and Definitions   

Organization and Nature of Business   
   
 DS Healthcare Group, Inc. (the  Company ,  DS Laboratories ,  DSKX ,  we ,  us  or  our ) was organized under the laws of the State of Florida in January 2007. The Company is engaged in the development and discovery of drug therapies for specialty pharmaceuticals and commercializes innovative personal care products for its consumer brand. The growing personal care products portfolio is distributed through a network of domestic and international retailers and distributors. The Company researches and develops its own products, which management believes keeps the Company at the forefront of innovation. Our goal is to immediately commercialize unique and disruptive technologies for personal care products that consumers use every day and to advance drug development to capitalize on both short term and long term projects. 
   
  NOTE 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
 The significant accounting policies we use for quarterly financial reporting are the same as those disclosed in Note 2 of the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.  
   
   Principles of Consolidation and Presentation   
   
 The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting where revenues and expenses are recognized in the period in which they were incurred. The basis of accounting is US GAAP. 
   
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its operating subsidiaries DS Laboratories, Inc., Sigma Development and Holding Co., Inc., Polaris Labs, Inc., Polymer Research, Inc. and Divine Skin Laboratories, S.A. de CV ( DS Mexico ). Also included in the condensed consolidated financial statements are the operating activities of Velocity Storage and Packaging, LLC and Wally Group, LLC, an inactive entity, which are accounted for as VIEs. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
 On March 30, 2016, during the preparation of the Company s 10-K, the company identified that certain transactions recorded in the company s 10-K report for it consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and the results of each quarterly 10-Q filings for the period ending September 30, 2015 became subject to an internal investigation.  The internal investigation resulted in the company s inability to timely file it s for 10-Q as required.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 (Unaudited) 

NOTE 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  
   
 The Company continued its review these transactions with its newly appointed independent accountants, the results of which have now been corrected and reflected in the restated unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The corrective actions identified errors related to sales and customer returns and allowances, amounts with respect to the recognition of revenues and customer accounts receivable, and the recording of certain stock transactions. 
   
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors consulted with management and analyzed the adjustments with the intent to correct the 2014 and 2015 10-Q filings to reflect these errors.  However, because of the above mentioned errors, the Audit Committee has directed the Company to conduct a thorough review of the financial records for calendar years ended 2014 and 2015 along with its independent accountants and believes the restated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, included herein to be fairly presented. 
   
   Prior Period Reclassifications   
   
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparability with the September 30, 2015 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net loss. 
   
   Use of Estimates   
   
 The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates.  
   
 Significant estimates and assumptions underlying these condensed consolidated financial statements include: 

Estimates of allowances for uncollectable accounts receivable, 

Estimates of inventory obsolescence and overhead and labor cost allocations, 

Estimates assuming future earning capacity of our intangible assets, 

Estimates of value of equity transactions for services rendered, 

Estimates of returned or damaged product, and 

Estimates made in our deferred income tax calculations, for which there is a full valuation allowance. 

Revenue Recognition   
   
 The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following four criteria are met: 

persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, 
 shipping terms are FOB shipping point 

delivery has occurred, 

the sales price is fixed or determinable and 

Collectability is probable. 

Shipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenues when billed to customers or included in the sales price. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.

 (Unaudited) 

NOTE 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  
   
   Research and Development   
   
 The Company currently maintains a functional laboratory employing a full time chemist and a lab technician that identify new technology, test product alternatives and improve existing formulations. In addition, our founder and President devotes a substantial portion of his time in identifying new technologies and formulations to develop new products and improve existing products with the newest technology available. Such activities are expensed in the year incurred. Such costs include laboratory supplies, salaries, materials and consultant fees. These costs are classified as product development, salaries, selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, and amounted to $108,731 and $209,445 for 2015-YTD and 2014-YTD, respectively. 
   
   Earnings Per Share   
   
 Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for all of the periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations because the reported net loss in each of these periods results in their inclusion being anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive securities, which consist of stock options and warrants that are not included in the diluted net loss per share calculation, consisted of an aggregate of 1,036,140 shares and 286,526 shares as of September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
   
   Debt Discounts   
   
 The Company records, as a discount to notes, the relative fair value of warrants issued in connection with the issuances and the intrinsic value of any conversion options based on the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note and the effective conversion price embedded in the note.  Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the earlier of the term of the related debt or its earliest redemption date. 
   
  NOTE 3.   LIQUIDITY and GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company has sustained operational losses since its inception, however commencing in Q3 2014 it began to take steps to achieve profitability   in the future .  Such steps included increasing gross profit through price increases in Q2 2014, improved operational efficiencies and through formula changes to reduce cost without reducing efficacy. The Company also decreased overall G A expenses by implementing cost controls over the last two quarters. At September 30, 2015, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $12,028,028 compared to $10,235,944 at December 31, 2014. The Company cannot predict how long it will continue to incur further losses or whether it will ever achieve profitability as this is dependent upon the continued reduction of certain operating expenses, success of new and existing products and increase in overall revenue among other things. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 As of September 30, 2015, the Company had $1,375,290 in cash. While the Company has historically financed its operations and growth primarily through the successful issuance and sale of shares of its common stock, a line of credit and the issuance of promissory notes, the Company has started several new revenue initiatives creating additional revenue streams. Some of these initiatives include: establishing an online store ( Shop.DSLaboratories.com ) which became operational in the third quarter of 2014, generating $415,078 2015-YTD   in net revenue. 
   
 The Company also established a hair treatment clinic which opened in late November 2014 which has not yet generated appreciable sales. So far, in 2015, the Company launched a range of new products. Although the Company cannot predict its success with these products or projects, all are currently under development and production and in various stages of completion. The Company has commenced implementing, and will continue to implement, various measures to address its financial condition, including but not limited to: 

Continuing to seek debt and equity financing. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. 

The Company completed an operational budget for 2015-2017 that sets changes in its processes to focus on profitability. The Company is also implementing a feedback process with improved interdepartmental communication.

NOTE 3.   LIQUIDITY and GOING CONCERN (Continued)  
   
 Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and carrying amount or classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company has commenced implementing, and will continue to implement, various measures to address our financial condition. 
   
  NOTE 4.   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
   
 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement   Period Adjustments.  This ASU simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination; the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments.  This ASU will require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. It also requires that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  This ASU is effective for the annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating whether the adoption of this new guidance will have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
   
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  This ASU simplifies the guidance on the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring inventory within the scope of this update to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than the lower of cost or market. This ASU is effective for the annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating whether the adoption of this new guidance will have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
   
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . This standard amends the existing guidance to require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as a deferred charge. This ASU is effective on a retrospective basis for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
   
 Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. 
   
  NOTE 5.   RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
 On September 28, 2016, during the preparation of the Company s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the company identified certain transactions recorded in the company s 10-K report for it consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and the results of each quarterly 10-Q filings for the periods ending March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015, and determined these transactions did not reflect the proper matching of revenues and costs. The impact of these transactions on the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, have been considered and have been disclosed and reported in the notes to the Company s financial statements as reported in the annual 10-K report for the year ending December 31, 2015.

NOTE 6.   W/R GROUP, INC.  
   
 On August 18, 2015 and further amended on September 24, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement, dated as of August 31, 2015, with Carey Williams and Stefan Russell, the owners of all of the capital stock of W/R Group, Inc., an Arizona corporation ( WRG ).   Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, the Company and WRG Acquisition Corporation, a newly formed Arizona subsidiary of the Company (the  Buyer ) agreed to cause the Buyer to purchase 100% of the assets and business of WRG and to assume substantially all of the liabilities of WRG, including certain pre-closing contingent liabilities, but excluding tax obligations arising prior to the closing date. In addition to the Buyer s assumption of the assumed liabilities, the Company agreed to cause the Buyer to pay total consideration of up to $42.25 million, of which, $30.0 million is payable at closing in cash to the WRG stockholders and up to $12.25 million is payable as earn-out payments over the five consecutive fiscal years of WRG commencing January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2020, subject to extension and other earn-out provisions.  If the maximum earn-out amount of $12.25 million is earned, $11.0 million will be paid in cash and $1.25 million will be paid in shares of the Company s stock based on the market price of the Company s stock as of the closing date.  Additionally, the Company agreed to pay $4.0 million at closing in cash to one of the WRG stockholder in connection with the outstanding accrued principal and interest payable under a $4,000,000 secured promissory note assumed by the Buyer. On October 26, 2015 former management of the Company announced it had executed a term sheet with a lender. -As of the date of filing  this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Board of Directors have not approved the lenders terms, neither has any debt obligation been executed by either the prior or existing management, and no expectations to complete such a transaction with the lender.  In addition, the acquisition of WRG has not been consummated.

NOTE 11.   NOTES PAYABLE  
   
 The Company was a party to a note payable for $350,000 which was due on May 28, 2015.  The note payable was secured by finished goods and bore interest at 1% per month. On June 1, 2015 the parties agreed to convert the note plus accrued interest to common shares. Subsequently, on September 15, 2015, the Company issued 191,202 common shares to settle the outstanding note payable of $350,000 plus accrued interest of $37,100. 
   
 The Company is party to a note payable that was originally issued on April 20, 2015 for $250,000 and was amended on September 1, 2015 to $450,000. The note payable is secured by inventory and bears interest at 1% per month and matures on December 31, 2015. In connection with the note, the Company has also issued warrants to purchase 30,000 common shares at $0.85 per share with an expiration date of April 20, 2017 and warrants to purchase 8,000 common shares at $2.50 per share with an expiration date of September 1, 2017. The warrants had an aggregate estimated relative fair value of $26,049, which was recorded as a discount to the note payable with an offsetting amount to additional paid-in-capital. This amount is being amortized over the life of the note payable and the unamortized discount amount at September 30, 2015 was $12,440. 
   
 On September 15, 2015, the warrant for 30,000 common shares were exercised for cash proceeds of $25,500. 
   
  NOTE 12.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

NOTE 18.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (Continued)  
   
 Throughout the year ended 2014 and 2015, Daniel Khesin, the Company's former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, received in addition to base compensation, reimbursement and payroll advances of expenses of approximately $76,000 and $40,000 respectively, which were for non-business related goods and services. Pursuant to his executive employment agreement $50,000 in shares were to be payable in shares of the Company's common stock at fiscal year-end. While Mr. Khesin believed that these payments were received as satisfaction of certain bonus or other perquisites earned by him on a monthly basis under his employment agreement, such payments, if any, required approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received until subsequent to 2014 and 2015. Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits advances or loans to a director or executive officer of a public company. While our audit committee has concluded that the payments made to Mr. Khesin prior to board approval may be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, in the event it is determined any such payments were a violation of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, such violation could have a material adverse effect on our Company, including, but not limited to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, penalties, or investigations, in addition to potential securities litigation. As a consequence of these activities, the company received notice from its independent auditor of potential illegal acts concerning payments of personal expenses by the Company. The Company s Audit Committee has agreed with the findings. On September 29, 2016. The company, in accordance with Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, informed the Commission in a letter also dated September 29, 2016. See  Controls and Procedures  and  Executive Compensation  below. 
   
 During 2013, in addition to base compensation paid to Abner Silva, a consultant deemed to be an officer by our independent auditor for accounting purposes, our company advanced approximately $11,500, to Mr. Silva. While Mr. Silva, believed that these payments were received as satisfaction of certain moneys owed to him or his affiliate companies, such payments, if any, required prior approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received. As a consequence of these activities, the company received notice from its independent auditor of potential illegal acts concerning payments of personal expenses by the company on September 29, 2016. The company, in accordance with Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, informed the Commission in a letter also dated September 29, 2016. 
   
 In December 2015, the Company, under former management entered into an agreement with a barter trading company to sell slow moving, finished goods in exchange for prepaid credits. During 2015 and through April 2016, the Company sold merchandise worth $956,176 and $4,566,717 to this barter trading company. However, these credits proved to have no economic value and accordingly revenue did not meet the criteria as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 605 ( ASC ). The Company has reversed the sales to this barter trading company that did not meet the revenue standards. 
   
 In January 2016, the company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with a private party in the amount of $1,996,500 for 605,000 shares of the company s stock. To date, the purchase agreement has only partially settled. The Company s has offset subscription receivable against the additional paid in capital of $1,196,500. The Board of Directors has decided to negotiate a revision to the original Stock Purchase Agreement to reach an appropriate resolution to the matter. The company has no way of knowing what the financial impact will be. 
   
 On May 2, 2016, the company received a letter from an attorney representing its former CEO, Renee Barch-Niles requesting certain payments she believes are due arising from her employment contract. This includes salary demands, equity demands and commission demands on the above barter transaction. The total claims made by Ms. Barch-Niles are $2,500,000 worth of shares of the company s stock, $123,000 in commissions from the barter trading arrangement, and $300,000 in severance payments. The company maintains that Ms. Barch-Niles is not due any payments subsequent to her separation from the company and will take all appropriate action to defend against the claims.  
   
 On September 27, 2016, pursuant to the Company s By-Laws, the current Board of Directors approved and ratified all shares to the former management through date of termination. It is the Company s position that due to circumstances surrounding the terminations, no further shares or compensation are owned and will vehemently defend its position.

 This discussion is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report. 
   
  Significant Accounting Policies  
   
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 2 to condensed consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as defined below. 
   
 A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: 1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and 2) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
   
 Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. Based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that our condensed consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements: 
   
   Risks and Uncertainties     The Company s business could be impacted by price pressure on its product manufacturing, acceptance of its products in the market place, new competitors, changes in federal and/or state legislation and other factors. The Company also has been experiencing significant growth which puts serious strains on its cash availability requirements. If the Company is unsuccessful in securing adequate liquidity, its plans may be curtailed. Adverse changes in these areas could negatively impact the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
   
   Accounts Receivable     Accounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. 

28 

Inventory     Inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Our inventory is subject to expiration and obsolescence. Accordingly, quantities purchased and sell through rates are periodically monitored for potential overstocking or pending expiration as a basis for establishing the appropriate reserve for any estimated expiration or obsolescence. 
   
   Revenue Recognition       The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following four criteria are met: 

persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, 

Shipping terms are FOB shipping point, 

delivery has occurred, 

the sales price is fixed or determinable and 

collectability is probable. 

Shipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenues when billed to customers or included in the sales price. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. 
   
   Research and Development     The Company incurs formulation costs that include salaries, materials and consultant fees. These costs are classified as product development, selling and general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2014  
   
   Revenues, net     Total net revenues decreased $81,186 or 2.5%, from $3,200,716 for the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $3,119,530 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in net revenues is a result of restating certain transactions that did not match with the Company s revenue recognition policy (see Footnote 5. Restatement of Financial Statements to the attached financial statements), offset by an increase in overall sales for the period. 
   
 Our product revenues represent primarily sales of Revita and Revita Cor, which individually exceeded 10% of total sales and collectively represented approximately 35% and 41% of total sales for 2015-QTR and 2014-QTR, respectively.  In addition, Spectral DNC-N and Spectral DNC 5% both represented 5% of total sales for 2015-QTR as compared to 7% and 5% of total sales for 2014-QTR, respectively. Furthermore, Polaris NR11 represented approximately 5% of total sales for 2015-QTR as compared to 4% of total sales for 2014-QTR, while Polaris NR09 sales in 2015-QTR was nominal as compared to approximately 5% of total sales for 2014-QTR.  
   
 Net revenue from our Mexican subsidiary increased 4.4% in 2015-QTR compared to 2014-QTR, accounting for $994,391 (27.3%) and $952,472 (27.6%) of consolidated net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Net revenue from our Mexican subsidiary increased as a result of increased product demand offset by the stronger dollar compared to the Mexican Peso.  Net sales generated from US operations decreased as a result of the timing and receipt of customer orders.  We continue our marketing and sales efforts to expand our customer base, with our primary focus on expanding our distributor base, both domestic and foreign. Revenues from our top ten customers accounted for approximately 51.7% and 33.6% of our total revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
   
   Cost of Goods Sold     Total cost of goods sold increased $328,244 or 49.5%, from $782,745 (2014-QTR) to $1,110,989 (2015-QTR).  This increase is primarily as a result of restating certain transactions that did not match with the Company s revenue recognition policy (see Footnote 5. Restatement of Financial Statements to the attached financial statements), a one-time inventory reserve reversal charge of approximately $100,000 in 2014-QTR, as well as overall lower costs of goods sold in 2014-QTR relating to approximately $180,000 of freight costs that were eliminated due to reduced expedited delivery in 2014-QTR and approximately $75,000 reduction of bill of materials costs in 2014-QTR as a result of reformulation efforts to remove expensive components and maintain efficacy. 

29 

The gross margin has declined from 75.5% (2014-QTR) to 64.4% (2015-QTR), with US operations accounting for $1,874,180 or 76% (2014-QTR) and $1,476,086 or 73.0% (2015-QTR) of the gross margin dollars and with DS Mexico accounting for $543,791 or 24% (2014-QTR) and $532,515 or 27% (2015-QTR) of gross margin dollars. 
   
   Selling and Marketing Costs       Selling and marketing costs increased $504,091 or 54.8% from $919,410 (2014-QTR) to $1,423,501 (2015-QTR). The increase was due to the following: 

Increases of: 

$332,225 for commission and consulting primarily stock based compensation and as a result of increased sales incentives, 

$115,813 for marketing and promotion, primarily as a result of increased marketing campaigns and efforts, and 

$56,053 for other selling and marketing expenses, primarily as a result of higher freight and shipping costs as a result of increased international shipping and increased order volume. 

General and Administrative Costs       General and administrative costs decreased $341,113 or 19.9%, from $1,668,807 (2014-QTR) to $1,396,060 (2015-QTR). The decrease is due to the following: 

Decreases of: 

$273,719 for professional fees and consultant costs primarily as a result of decreased consultants and changes from consulting to full-time employee status, and 

$69,937 for other general and administrative expenses, primarily as a result of $47,040 in lower bank charges as a result of improved internal policies within A/R for wire and bank costs as well as overall fees for transactions, $23,980 in lower insurance expense as a result of improved rates and $39,760 in lower rent as a result of consolidating facilities, partially offset by increase in various other general and administrative expense items aggregating to $34,402. 

Partially offset by increases of: 

$71,349 for salary and personnel costs, primarily as a result of increased headcount.  

Other Income and Expenses         Other expense increased $82,043 or 167.9%, from $48,878 income (2014-QTR) to $33,165 expense (2015-QTR), primarily as a result of higher interest expense of $33,392 and lower other income of $48,651. 
   
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014  
   
   Revenues, net     Total net revenues decreased $508,054 or 5.3%, from $9,630,103 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $9,122,049 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net revenues is a result of restating certain transactions that did not match with the Company s revenue recognition policy (see Footnote 5. Restatement of Financial Statements to the attached financial statements), offset by an increase in overall sales for the period. 
   
  Our product revenues represent primarily sales of Revita and Revita Cor, which individually exceeded 10% of total sales and collectively represented approximately 35% and 41% of total sales for 2015-YTD and 2014-YTD, respectively.  In addition, Spectral DNC-N represented approximately 7% of total sales for each period, while Spectral DNC 5% and Polaris NR09 represented 4% and 3% of total sales for 2015-YTD, respectively, as compared to 5% total sales for 2014-YTD for both products.   

30 

Net revenue from our Mexican subsidiary increased 0.6% in 2015-YTD compared to 2014-YTD, accounting for $2,573,157 (28%) and $2,556,650 (27%) of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 respectively.  The increase in net revenue from our Mexican subsidiary was considered nominal.  Net sales generated from US operations increased as a result of higher demand offset by the stronger dollar compared to the Mexican Peso. We continue our marketing and sales efforts to expand our customer base, with our primary focus on expanding our distributor base, both domestic and foreign. Revenues from our top ten customers accounted for approximately 41.0% and 42.7% of our total revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
   
   Cost of Goods Sold     Total cost of goods sold decreased $337,497 or 3.4%, from $4,001,644 (2014-YTD) to $5,457,902 (2015-YTD).  This decrease is primarily as a result of restating certain transactions that did not match with the Company s revenue recognition policy (see Footnote 5. Restatement of Financial Statements to the attached financial statements), and a one-time inventory reserve reversal charge of approximately $215,000 in 2014-YTD.   
   
 The gross margin has slightly increased from 58.4% (2014-YTD) to 59.8% (2015-YTD), with US operations accounting for $4,153,114 or 73.8% (2014-YTD) and $4,028,490 or 73.8% (2015-YTD) of the gross margin dollars and with DS Mexico accounting for $1,475,345 or 25.1% (2014-YTD) and $1,429,412 or 23.2% (2015-YTD) of gross margin dollars. 
   
   Selling and Marketing Costs     Selling and marketing costs increased $7,955 or 0.3% from $3,126,000 (2014-YTD) to $3,118,045 (2015-YTD). The increase was due to the following: 

Increases of: 

$102,972 for commissions and consulting primarily as a result of increased sales incentives, and 

$160,577 for marketing and promotion primarily as a result of stock based compensation and increased marketing campaigns and programs. 

Partially offset by decreases of: 

$271,071 for other selling and marketing expenses primarily as a result of $147,163 in lower freight and shipping costs as a result of improved operation efficiencies and cost cutting measures and $123,908 in lower product development as a result of completion and product launches.  

General and Administrative Costs       General and administrative costs decreased $681,505 or 15.1%, from $4,511,574 (2014-YTD) to $3,830,069 (2015-YTD). The decrease is due to the following: 

Decreases of: 

$614,663 for professional fees and consultant costs primarily as a result of cost cutting measures, changes from consultant to employee status, 

$46,767 for salary and personnel costs, which is considered nominal, and 

$70,013 for other general and administrative expenses, primarily as a result of $96,038 in lower bank charges as a result of improved internal policies within A/R for wire and bank analysis costs as well as overall fees for transactions, $28,946 in lower insurance expense as a result of improved rates, $61,498 in lower rent as a result of consolidating facilities, $24,588 in lower repairs and maintenance and $3,278 decrease in various other general and administrative expense items, partially offset by increase of $351,772 in higher bad debt expenses as a result of one-time reserve charge for a specific customer totaling $251,055. 

31 

Other Income and Expenses     Other income increased $309,711 from $7,839 income (2014-YTD) to $301,872 expense (2015-YTD). The increase is a result of a charge for an impaired intangible brand right agreement of $337,500, offset by an increase in interest income of $24,759.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 We had cash of $1,375,290 and working capital of $4,194,247 at September 30, 2015. Our operating and capital requirements in connection with supporting our expanding operations and introducing new products have been and will continue to be significant to us. Since inception, our losses from operations and working capital required to grow our business were satisfied primarily through the private sales of our common stock and by credit financing. 
   
 Despite our losses since inception, we believe that by increasing our sales and gross profit margins while maintaining and better optimizing our current operational structure and administrative expenses, we can minimize the cash needed to support our operations. Our largest consumption of cash is the working capital necessary to support expanding sales. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and may also result in covenants that would restrict our operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 We have commenced implementing, and will continue to implement, various measures to address our financial condition, including methods to increase gross profit margins and reducing and streamlining our operational costs and overhead. We have historically satisfied our working capital requirements through the sale of common stock, advances from related parties and third parties and through our credit facility. We are continuing to seek debt and equity financing; however, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. 
   
  Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  
   
   Cash Flows from Operating Activities   
   
 Operating activities used net cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $1,048,383. Our net loss, when adjusted by various non-cash items aggregating $535,048 which impact net loss but do not impact cash during the period, such as stock issued for services or depreciation and amortization, resulted in a net loss of $437,600. In addition, changes in operating assets and liabilities necessary to support our operations used cash of $356,900 as follows: 

$274,428 used by an increase in gross accounts receivable not including the non-cash effect of changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts, 

$87,488 used for increased inventory levels which is not considered significant, 

$12,662 provided by a decrease prepaid expenses and other current assets which is not considered significant, 

$12,819 used for increased other assets which is not considered significant,  

$51,796 used for decreased accounts payable which is not considered significant, 

$198,780 provided by change in accrued expenses primarily due to the settlement of certain accrued, and expenses with issuance of common stock. 

Cash Flows used in Investing Activities   
   
 Our investing activities used $2,555 in net cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which is not considered significant. 

32 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities   
   
 Our financing activities contributed $1,186,472 in net cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of $720,000 proceeds from the sale of common stock, $450,000 proceeds from loans and notes, $25,500 proceeds from exercise of warrants less the use of $9,028 in repayment of loans and notes. 
   
  Financial Position  
   
   Total Assets     Our total assets increased $142,836 or 1.7% from $8,281,328 as of December 31, 2014 to $8,424,164 as of September 30, 2015 as a result of a net increase in current assets of $562,499, partially offset with a net decrease in non-current assets.   The net decrease of $376,625 in non-current assets was a result of a $337,500 charge for an impaired intangible brand rights asset offset by decreased amortization of intangible assets and a $55,857 decrease in furniture and equipment, net due primarily to depreciation.  These decreases were partially offset by $12,819 increased other assets, which is not significant.  The component of the net increase in current assets are discussed below. 
   
   Current Assets     The net increase in current assets of $562,499 was due to increases in cash of $246,734, accounts receivable of $134,295 and inventories, net of $194,132.  Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $12,662.  For increase in cash, see further discussion above in cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The net changes for current assets are primarily driven by changes discussed below: 
   
   Inventory     Inventory levels increased 5.0% from December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2015.  Average inventory represents approximately 75.4% of COGS or over a nine month supply based on the sell through rate achieved for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in an inventory turnover rate of 1.33 times. This inventory turn rate should improve as we ramp up sales volume that can now be met with smoother production timing. 
   
   Accounts Receivable, net     Accounts receivable increased $134,295   primarily as a result of increased concentration of sales during the last weeks of Q3 2015. The receivables are in line with historical averages for previous quarters and these levels of sales. 
   
   Prepaid Expenses and other current assets     Prepaid expenses decreased 4.5%, which is not significant. 
   
   Total Liabilities     Our total liabilities decreased $433,255 or 11.2% from $3,765,689 as of December 31, 2014 to $3,332,434 as of September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of a net decrease in current liabilities of $424,227.  The component of the net decrease in current liabilities are discussed below. 
   
   Current Liabilities     The net decrease in current liabilities of $427,227 was due to decreases in accounts payable of $269,329, accrued expenses of $219,021 and other current liabilities of $23,437.  Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in note payable of $87,560.  The net changes for current liabilities are primarily driven by changes discussed below: 
   
   Accounts payable       Accounts payable decreased 18.1% primarily due to timing of payments to vendors and suppliers. 
   
   Accrued expenses     Accrued expenses decreased $219,021 or 21.5% primarily due to the payment of these items with issuance of shares of Company s common stock. 
   
   Note payable     Note payable increased $87,560 primarily due to proceeds from loans and notes, partially offset with a decrease of $350,000 due to payment of such amount in the form of shares of Company s common stock. 
   
   Other current liabilities     Other current liabilities decreased 2.6%, which is not significant.

Material Commitments  
   
  WRG Asset Purchase Agreement  
   
 On August 18, 2015 and further amended on September 24, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement, dated as of August 31, 2015, with Carey Williams and Stefan Russell, the owners of all of the capital stock of W/R Group, Inc., an Arizona corporation ( WRG ). Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, the Company and WRG Acquisition Corporation, a newly formed Arizona subsidiary of the Company (the  Buyer ) agreed to cause the Buyer to purchase 100% of the assets and business of WRG and to assume substantially all of the liabilities of WRG, including certain pre-closing contingent liabilities, but excluding tax obligations arising prior to the closing date. In addition to the Buyer s assumption of the assumed liabilities, the Company agreed to cause the Buyer to pay total consideration of up to $42.25 million, of which, $30.0 million is payable at closing in cash to the WRG stockholders and up to $12.25 million is payable as earn-out payments over the five consecutive fiscal years of WRG commencing January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2020, subject to extension and other earn-out provisions. If the maximum earn-out amount of $12.25 million is earned, $11.0 million will be paid in cash and $1.25 million will be paid in shares of the Company s stock based on the market price of the Company s stock as of the closing date. Additionally, the Company agreed to pay $4.0 million at closing in cash to one of the WRG stockholder in connection with the outstanding accrued principal and interest payable under a $4,000,000 secured promissory note assumed by the Buyer. On October 26, 2015 the Company announced it had executed a term sheet with a lender for $35 million in non-convertible senior debt. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter 2015, subject to the completion of the Company s and the lenders due diligence process. There can be no assurance that the Company will obtain financing on acceptable terms, or that the acquisition will be completed. As of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the acquisition of WRG has not been consummated.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
   
 In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement   Period Adjustments. This ASU simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination; the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. This ASU will require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. It also requires that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  This ASU is effective for the annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  We are currently evaluating whether the adoption of this new guidance will have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
   
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This ASU simplifies the guidance on the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring inventory within the scope of this update to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than the lower of cost or market. This ASU is effective for the annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating whether the adoption of this new guidance will have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
   
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This standard amends the existing guidance to require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as a deferred charge. This ASU is effective on a retrospective basis for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations. 

34 

Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. 
   
  Subsequent Events  
   
 As of October 26, 2015, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Renee Barch-Niles (the  Barch-Niles Employment Agreement ) as its new Chief Executive Officer.

    ITEM 3.  
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  
   
 Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 
   
  ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the forms and rules of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, in a manner to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
   
 In connection with the preparation of this Form 10 Q, our management, including the CEO and CFO, updated its December 31, 2014 evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2015. As described below, management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which is an integral component of our disclosure controls and procedures. As a result of those material weaknesses, our management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, as a result of certain material weaknesses. 
   
 The specific material weaknesses that management identified in our internal controls as of September 30, 2015 that persist are as follows: 

We did not have adequate staffing resources to 1) prepare account reconciliations, financial statements; fluctuation analysis and relevant analytics on a timely basis, and 2) provide appropriate review and supervision for all necessary areas.  Additionally, our general staff do not have the necessary training to perform appropriate analytical and/or review procedures. 
   
 We did not have a sufficient number of 1) adequately trained technical accounting and external reporting personnel to support standalone external financial reporting under SEC requirements, and 2) personnel with necessary experience with United States generally accepted accounting principles to address and report fluctuation analysis and relevant analytics to senior management. 
   
 We did not have appropriate written internal control documentation of our process and procedures for all necessary areas, including documentation and testing of key internal controls. 

35 

We did not obtain adequate documentation to support all credit card transactions. 
   
 We did not obtain adequate documentation to support revenue recognition, resulting in recognition of revenue for products not shipped and appropriateness of amount being billed. 
   
 We did not have effective controls over stock based payments made to employees and non-employees, including proper accounting of awards as either equity or liability awards and timely processing and recording of stock based payment arrangements. 
   
 We did not have effective controls over issuing customer credit approvals and product credit memorandums. As a result, credits were issued by multiple individuals and without the finance department s approval and in some cases overwritten certain credit policies and procedures. 
   
 We did not have effective controls over our revenue recognition and policies which caused certain products to be shipped to customers without prior credit checks and approvals from the finance department. 
   
 We did not have effective controls over customer pricing and as a result pricing discrepancies between wholesale and retail were established by multiple individuals without the correct policies and procedures. 
   
 We did not have effective controls over our executive management s overrides of certain policies and procedures, as a result certain advances, expenses and other possible illegal activities may have occurred. 
   
 We did not have effective controls over stock issuances and as result shares may have been issued without the correct approval and documentation. 
   
 We did not have effective controls over incentives to the sales force and as a result customers received incentives that were not properly designed, approved or lacked proper structure. 
   
 We did not have effective controls over the advance of $11,500 to Abner Silva in 2013, which we have deemed an officer. As a result, these payments were received as satisfaction of certain moneys owed to him or his affiliate companies, such payments, if any, required prior approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received. This loan may be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and such violation could have a material adverse effect on our Company, including, but not limited to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, penalties, or investigations, in addition to potential securities litigation. 
   
 We also did not effectively implement comprehensive entity level internal controls and were unable to adequately segregate duties within the accounting department due to an insufficient number of staff, and implement appropriate information technology controls. 
   
 Throughout the year ended 2014 and 2015, Daniel Khesin, the Company's former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, received in addition to base compensation, reimbursement and payroll advances of expenses which were for non-business related goods and services. Pursuant to his executive employment agreement $50,000 in shares were to be payable in shares of the Company's common stock at fiscal year-end. While Mr. Khesin believed that these payments were received as satisfaction of certain bonus or other perquisites earned by him on a monthly basis under his employment agreement, such payments, if any, required approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received until subsequent to 2014 and 2015. Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits advances or loans to a director or executive officer of a public company. While our audit committee has concluded that the payments made to Mr. Khesin prior to board approval may be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, in the event it is determined any such payments were a violation of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, such violation could have a material adverse effect on our Company, including, but not limited to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, penalties, or investigations, in addition to potential securities litigation. As a consequence of these activities, the company received notice from its independent auditor of potential illegal acts concerning payments of personal expenses by the Company. The Company s Audit Committee has agreed with the findings. On September 29, 2016. The company, in accordance with Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, informed the Commission in a letter also dated September 29, 2016. See  Controls and Procedures  and  Executive Compensation  below. 

36 

We consider the payment of the personal benefits prior to receiving board approval, as a failure of our internal control system. See  Risk Factors  above. To remediate this failure, we have implemented enhanced controls over credit card and cash disbursements and documentation under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer, John Power. We have also enhanced controls over expense reporting and established stricter guidelines for transaction receipts. These enhanced controls include, but are not limited to establishing a preparation and review functions for expense reports, mandatory receipt requirement, limited access to the physical credit card and weekly reporting. We feel that these enhancements will be adequate to prevent this event from recurring in the future. 
   
 Since our inception we have relied on an outside accounting consultants to ensure that our financial statements contain all necessary adjustments to conform to U.S. GAAP. The consultants are U.S. certified public accountants. We expect to be materially dependent upon consultants or another third parties which can provide us with the same level of accounting consulting services, for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. Furthermore, in an effort to remediate certain of the weaknesses above we have also added three independent directors to our board of directors who have formed an audit committee including the appointment of a financial expert. The committee is charged with, and has been, developing financial policies and controls, reviewing and providing oversight to our financial reporting processes, financial statements and public filings. Our ability to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will be dependent upon the development and implementation of these changes, which will require both the hiring of additional accounting personnel and the investment in enhanced systems, policies and procedures. While we expect to continue to rely upon our outside accounting consultants until such time as we are able to hire a properly qualified chief financial officer, if we are able to successfully implement these changes to our internal control over financial reporting we believe we will be able to remediate substantially all of the material weaknesses described earlier in this section. However, there are no assurances we will be able to devote the necessary capital to hire the additional personnel and institute the additional systems, policies and procedures to the level necessary. In that event, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses described earlier in this section will not result in errors in our financial statements in future periods. 
   
 Our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. 
   
 The Company is a non-accelerated filer and is not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Accordingly, this Annual Report does not contain an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting, since the rules for smaller reporting companies provide for this exemption. 
   
  Plans for Remediation of Material Weaknesses  
   
 We intend to implement changes to strengthen our internal controls. We are in the process of developing and/or implementing remediation plans for the identified material weaknesses and we expect that work on the plans will continue throughout 2016 and possibly into 2017, as financial resources permit.    The Company is currently working on formalizing its policies and procedures in writing and to improve the integration of its financial consolidation and reporting system into non accounting departments. Where appropriate, the Company is receiving advice and assistance from third-party experts as it implements and refines its remediation plan. 
   
 We will begin to implement remediation procedures in two areas of our operations.  First we will restructure the financial reporting process to provide an improved review function by restructuring the responsibilities of both the accounting staff and the participation of the company s non-accounting personnel. The addition of the financial review process should reduce the risk of reporting errors in the preparation and delivery of financial results. 

37 

As part of the restructuring of responsibilities, we will also have increased the scope and involvement of non-accounting personnel to provide more direct operational insight into reported financial information in an effort to improve both its relevance and its accuracy.  In connection with that restructuring of responsibilities, we are providing additional training in best practices accounting procedures and GAAP to non-accounting personnel to improve the accuracy of reported financial information. 
   
 To assist both accounting and non-accounting personnel in their efforts to improve efficiency and accuracy, we will begin to restructure the chart of accounts to improve clarity and reduce the risk of inaccurate or misposting errors.  The new chart of accounts will provide clearer, more informative titles and reduces redundancy. 
   
 Additional measures may be necessary, and the measures we expect to take to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that such material weakness or other material weaknesses would not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In addition, other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 Except as otherwise stated above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
