EXPLANATORY NOTE 
  This report combines the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016   of DCT Industrial Trust Inc., a Maryland corporation, and DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership. Except as otherwise indicated herein, the terms  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP. When we use the term  DCT  or  DCT Industrial,  we are referring to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries, and when we use the term  Operating Partnership,  we are referring to DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries. 
  We are a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the ownership, acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk-distribution and light-industrial properties located in high-demand distribution markets in the United States. DCT's actively managed portfolio is strategically located near population centers and well-positioned to take advantage of market dynamics. DCT has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. We own our properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of   September 30, 2016  , DCT owned approximately   96.1%   of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership. 
  We operate DCT and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management of DCT consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, DCT consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes. DCT does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of DCT and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. 
  We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of DCT and the Operating Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits: 
             
    enhances investors  understanding of DCT and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
                
    eliminates duplicative disclosures and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation as a substantial portion of the Company s disclosures apply to both DCT and the Operating Partnership; and 
                
    creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
     Stockholders  equity, partners  capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of DCT and those of the Operating Partnership. Equity interests in the Operating Partnership held by entities other than DCT are classified within partners  capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in DCT s financial statements. Equity interests of   3.9%   of the Operating Partnership were owned by executives and non-affiliated limited partners as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  To help investors understand the differences between DCT and the Operating Partnership, this report provides separate consolidated financial statements for DCT and the Operating Partnership; a single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of each entity s stockholders  equity or partners  capital, as applicable; and a combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes distinct information related to each entity. 
  This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for DCT and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that DCT and the Operating Partnership are both compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and 18 U.S.C.  1350.

Note 1   Organization 
  DCT Industrial Trust Inc. is a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the ownership, acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk-distribution and light-industrial properties located in high-demand distribution markets in the United States. DCT's actively managed portfolio is strategically located near population centers and well-positioned to take advantage of market dynamics. As used herein, the terms  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP. When we use the term  DCT  or  DCT Industrial,  we are referring to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries, and when we use the term  Operating Partnership,  we are referring to DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries. 
  DCT was formed as a Maryland corporation in April 2002 and has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. DCT owns properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of   September 30, 2016  , DCT owned approximately   96.1%   of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned interests in approximately   73.5 million   square feet of properties leased to approximately   900   customers, including: 
             
    64.7 million   square feet comprising   398   consolidated operating properties, including   three   buildings totaling   0.8 million   square feet classified as held for sale, that were   96.2%   occupied; 
                
    7.8 million   square feet comprising   23   unconsolidated properties that were   97.2%   occupied and which we operated on behalf of   three   institutional capital management partners;  
                
    0.6 million   square feet comprising   four   consolidated properties under redevelopment; and 
                
    0.4 million   square feet comprising   three   consolidated properties in development. 
     In addition, the Company has   seven   projects under construction and several projects in pre-development.  See  Note 3   Investment in Properties" for further details. 

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Interim Financial Information    
  The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information. Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with GAAP. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of   December 31, 2015   and related notes thereto included in our Form 10-K filed on February 19, 2016. 
  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, the Operating Partnership, their wholly-owned qualified REIT subsidiaries and taxable REIT subsidiaries, and their consolidated joint ventures in which they have a controlling interest. 
  
   13 

Equity interests in the Operating Partnership held by entities other than DCT are classified within partners  capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in DCT s financial statements. Equity interests in entities consolidated into the Operating Partnership that are held by third parties are reflected in our accompanying balance sheets as noncontrolling interests. We also have noncontrolling partnership interests in unconsolidated institutional capital management and other joint ventures, which are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures for the purposes of operating and developing industrial real estate. All joint ventures over which we have financial and operating control, and variable interest entities ( VIEs ) in which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary, are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We use the equity method of accounting for joint ventures over which we do not have a controlling interest or where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions but where we exercise significant influence and include our share of earnings or losses of these joint ventures in our consolidated results of operations. 
  We analyze our joint ventures in accordance with GAAP to determine whether they are VIEs and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE involves consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation on the entity s board of directors, the size of our investment (including loans), our obligation or right to absorb its losses or receive its benefits and our ability to participate in major decisions.   
  If a joint venture does not meet the characteristics of a VIE, we apply the voting interest model to determine whether the entity should be consolidated. Our ability to assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the Consolidated Financial Statements and our financial position and results of operations. 
  We concluded our Operating Partnership meets the criteria of a VIE as the Operating Partnership s limited partners do not have the right to remove the general partner and do not have substantive participating rights in the operations of the Operating Partnership.  Under the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership (the  Partnership Agreement ), DCT is the primary beneficiary of the Operating Partnership as we have the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits, and the power to control substantially all of the activities which most significantly impact the economic performance of the Operating Partnership.  Accordingly, the Operating Partnership is consolidated within DCT s financial statements. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  At the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification. A lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee, (ii) lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the underlying property s economic life, or (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) are equal to 90% or more of the excess estimated fair value of the leased building. Generally our leases do not meet any of the criteria above and accordingly are classified as operating leases. We record rental revenues on a straight-line basis under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term. Certain properties have leases that provide for tenant occupancy during periods where no rent is due or where minimum rent payments change during the term of the lease. Accordingly, receivables from tenants that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term are recorded on the balance sheet as straight-line rent receivables. When we acquire a property, the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation. The total increase to  Rental revenues  due to straight-line rent adjustments was approximately   $5.2 million   and   $16.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   $0.9 million   and   $4.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  
   14 

If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized into rental revenues over the lease term. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, we record any tenant improvement allowance funded as a lease incentive and amortize it as a reduction of rental revenue over the lease term. Tenant recovery income includes reimbursements due from tenants pursuant to their leases for real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance and other recoverable property operating expenses and is recognized as  Rental revenues  during the period the related expenses are incurred. The reimbursements are recognized and presented on a gross basis, as the Company is generally the primary obligor and, with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers, has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk. Tenant recovery income recognized as  Rental revenues  was approximately   $23.3 million   and   $67.8 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   $20.6 million   and   $62.8 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If a customer fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances. In connection with property acquisitions qualifying as business combinations, we may acquire leases with rental rates above or below the market rental rates. Such differences are recorded as an intangible lease asset or liability and amortized to  Rental revenues  over the reasonably assured term of the related leases. We consider a reasonably assured term to be the measurement period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.  The unamortized balances of these assets and liabilities associated with the early termination of leases are fully amortized to their respective revenue line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining contractual lease term. The total net impact to  Rental revenues  due to the amortization of above and below market rents was an increase of approximately   $0.7 million   and   $2.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   $0.8 million   and   $2.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Early lease termination fees are recorded in  Rental revenues  on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining contractual lease term or upon collection if collectability is not assured. The total net impact to  Rental revenues  due to early lease termination fees was approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.9 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   $1.2 million   and   $2.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  We earn revenues from asset management fees, acquisition fees, property management fees and fees for other services pursuant to joint venture and other third-party agreements. These are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in  Institutional capital management and other fees.  We recognize revenues from asset management fees, acquisition fees, property management fees and fees for other services when the related fees are earned and are realized or realizable. 
  We develop certain properties for specific buyers, called build-to-suit projects. We make certain judgments based on the specific terms of each project as to the amount and timing of recognition of profits from the project. Projects are generally accounted for using the percentage of completion method or full accrual method. Profits under the percentage of completion method are based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts, commencing when the work performed under the contracts reaches a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. The percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to the costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. If the sale recognition criteria for using the percentage of completion or full accrual methods are not met, we apply another recognition method provided by GAAP, such as the installment or cost recovery methods. The profit recognized from these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and is included in  Development profit, net of taxes  in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

New Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update ( ASU ) that requires companies to recognize revenue from contracts with customers based upon the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also results in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provides guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improves guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The FASB subsequently issued additional ASU's which improve guidance and provide clarification of the new standard. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued an ASU that modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016. We concluded the Operating Partnership meets the criteria of a VIE and DCT is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we continue to consolidate the Operating Partnership. As the Operating Partnership was previously consolidated, the adoption of the ASU did not result in any changes to our conclusions regarding consolidation or deconsolidation of entities. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that modifies existing accounting standards for lease accounting.  The new standard requires a lessee to record an asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially the same as existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company expects this guidance to impact our Consolidated Financial Statements and is in the process of evaluating whether the effect will be material. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that clarifies how companies should classify certain cash receipts and payments on the statement of cash flows, including equity method investee distributions, insurance proceed settlements and contingent consideration payments made following a business combination. The new standard also clarifies the predominance principle applied when cash receipts and payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 3   Investment in Properties 
  Our consolidated investment in properties consists of operating properties, properties under development, properties in pre-development, redevelopment properties and land held for future development or other purposes. The historical cost of our investment in properties was (in thousands):  

Acquisition Activity 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we acquired   four   buildings totaling   0.6 million   square feet located in the Cincinnati, Dallas and Southern California markets for a total purchase price of approximately   $42.5 million  . Related to these acquisitions, we incurred acquisition costs of approximately   $0.6 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , included in "General and administrative" in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
  Development Activity 
  Our properties under development include the following: 
             
    Three   buildings totaling   0.4 million   square feet that are currently in lease-up as shell-complete activities have been completed as of   September 30, 2016  . These properties are   44.2%   leased based on weighted average square feet; and 
                
    Seven   projects are under construction totaling   2.4 million   square feet. 
     During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we acquired   65.1   acres of   land in the Baltimore/Washington D.C., Dallas and Denver markets   for approximately   $11.6 million   that is held for future development. 
  Disposition Activity 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold   11   consolidated operating properties totaling   2.0 million   square feet from our   Chicago, Houston, Louisville and Northern California markets   to third-parties for gross proceeds of approximately   $108.6 million  . We recognized gains of approximately   $43.1 million   on the disposition of these   11   properties. 
  Intangible Lease Assets and Liabilities 
  Aggregate amortization expense for intangible lease assets recognized in connection with property acquisitions (excluding assets and liabilities related to above and below market rents; see  Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  for additional information) was approximately   $2.8 million   and   $9.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   $3.6 million   and   $11.2 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. Our intangible lease assets and liabilities included the following (in thousands):   

17 

Note 4   Investments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  We enter into joint ventures primarily for purposes of operating and developing industrial real estate. Our investments in these joint ventures are included in  Investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures  in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  During September 2016, the TRT-DCT Venture III disposed of   one   property. We received approximately   $0.5 million   for our share of the gross proceeds and recognized our share of the gain on the sale of approximately   $0.1 million  , which is included in "Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  During September 2016, the Stirling Capital Investment joint venture completed development activities and leased   one   building totaling   0.4 million   square feet. 
  The following table summarizes our unconsolidated joint ventures (dollars in thousands): 

(1)   
    Although we contributed   100%   of the initial cash equity capital required by the venture, after return of certain preferential distributions on capital invested, profits and losses are generally split   50  /  50  . 
     Guarantees 
  There are no lines of credit or side agreements related to, or between, our unconsolidated joint ventures and us, and there are no derivative financial instruments between our unconsolidated joint ventures and us. In addition, we do not believe we have any material exposure to financial guarantees.

Note 5   Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their carrying values due to the short-term nature of settlement of these instruments. The fair values of other financial instruments subject to fair value disclosures were determined based on available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate estimates for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates. Our estimates may differ from the actual amounts that we could realize upon disposition. The following table summarizes these financial instruments (in thousands):   

(1)   
    The fair values of our borrowings were estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. Credit spreads and market interest rates used to determine the fair value of these instruments are based on unobservable Level 3 inputs which management has determined to be its best estimate of current market values. 
               (2)   
    The carrying amount of our fixed rate debt includes premiums and discounts and excludes deferred loan costs. 
               (3)   
    The fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash flows and the discounted expected variable cash flows based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from Level 2 observable market interest rate curves. We also incorporate a credit valuation adjustment, which is derived using unobservable Level 3 inputs, to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement. The asset or liability is included in  Other assets, net  or  Other liabilities,  respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
     The following table presents a reconciliation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The table also displays gains and losses due to changes in fair value, including both realized and unrealized, recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for Level 3 assets and liabilities. When assets and liabilities are transferred between levels, we recognize the transfer at the beginning of the period. There were no transfers between levels during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   

Hedging Activities 
  To manage interest rate risk for variable rate debt and issuances of fixed rate debt, we primarily use treasury locks and interest rate swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy. These derivatives are designed to mitigate the risk of future interest rate increases by providing a fixed interest rate for a limited, pre-determined period of time. Such derivatives have been used to hedge the variability in existing and future interest expense associated with existing variable rate borrowings and forecasted issuances of debt, which may include issuances of new debt, as well as refinancing of existing debt upon maturity. 
  
   19 

Accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the designation of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. 
    
  For derivatives designated as  cash flow  hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in  Other comprehensive income ( OCI )  in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (i.e., not included in earnings) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings or the hedging relationship is no longer effective at which time the ineffective portion of the derivative s change in fair value is recognized directly into earnings. We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship whenever financial statements are issued or earnings are reported and at least every three months. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
  During   June 2013  , certain of our consolidated ventures entered into   two   pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1 month USD LIBOR rates. The pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps have an effective date of   June 2013   and a maturity date of   June 2023  . These interest rates swaps effectively fix the interest rate on the related debt instruments at   4.72%  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had borrowings payable subject to these pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps with aggregate principal balances of approximately   $6.7 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively. 
  During   December 2015  , we entered into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1 month LIBOR rates on our   $200.0 million   unsecured term loan. The pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap has an effective date of   December 2015   and a maturity date of   December 2022  . The interest rate swap effectively fixes the interest rate on the related debt instrument at   3.31%  , however, there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt is subject to a   0.0%   floor. In the event that USD LIBOR is negative, the Company will make payments to the hedge counterparty equal to the spread between USD LIBOR and zero. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded approximately   $0.5 million   of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to a   0.0%   floor mismatch in the hedging relationships (i.e., there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt from which the hedged forecasted transactions are expected to flow is subject to a   0.0%   floor on the USD LIBOR component of the interest rate). As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had borrowings payable subject to this pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap with aggregate principal balances of approximately   $200.0 million  . 
  The following table presents the effect of our derivative financial instruments on our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands): 

Amounts reported in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  related to derivatives will be amortized to  Interest expense  as interest payments are made on our current debt and anticipated debt issuances. During the next 12 months, we estimate that approximately   $6.3 million   will be reclassified from  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  to  Interest expense  resulting in an increase in interest expense. 
  
   20 

Note 6   Outstanding Indebtedness 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding indebtedness of approximately   $1.6 billion   consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately   $35.3 million   representing our proportionate share of debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures. As of   December 31, 2015  , our outstanding indebtedness of approximately   $1.6 billion   consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately   $35.7 million   representing our proportionate share of debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately   $4.3 billion   and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately   $0.6 billion  . As of   December 31, 2015  , the gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately   $4.1 billion   and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately   $0.6 billion  . Our debt has various covenants with which we were in compliance as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Line of Credit 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   balance outstanding and   $396.5 million   available under our   $400.0 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of   one   letter of credit totaling   $3.5 million  . As of   December 31, 2015  , we had   $70.0 million   outstanding and   $326.5 million   available under our   $400.0 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of   one   letter of credit totaling   $3.5 million  . 
  Debt Issuance and Payoffs 
  On August 8, 2016, we issued   $250.0 million   of fixed rate senior unsecured notes in a private placement offering. The notes have an average term of   10 years  , a weighted average interest rate of   3.90%   and require semi-annual interest payments. We primarily used the proceeds to paydown our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, payoff a   $49.0 million   senior unsecured note at maturity and payoff a portion of our   $25.0 million   senior unsecured term loan maturing in April 2017. 
  Guarantee of Debt 
  DCT has guaranteed the Operating Partnership s obligations with respect to the senior unsecured notes and the bank unsecured credit facilities. 

Note 7   Noncontrolling Interests 
  DCT 
  Noncontrolling interests are the portion of equity, or net assets, in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Noncontrolling interests of DCT primarily represent limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and equity interests held by third party partners in consolidated real estate investments, including related parties as discussed in  Note 9   Related Party Transactions.  
  Operating Partnership 
  Equity interests in the Operating Partnership held by third-parties and LTIP Units, as defined in  Note 8   Stockholders  Equity of DCT and Partners  Capital of the Operating Partnership,  are classified as permanent equity of the Operating Partnership and as noncontrolling interests of DCT in the Consolidated Balance Sheets  . 

Note 8   Stockholders  Equity of DCT and Partners  Capital of the Operating Partnership 
  DCT 
  Common Stock 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   90.9 million   shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. 
  
   21 

On September 10, 2015, we registered a continuous equity offering program to replace our continuous equity offering program previously registered on May 29, 2013. Pursuant to this offering, we may sell up to   five million   shares of common stock from time-to-time through   September 10, 2018   in  at-the-market  offerings or certain other transactions. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued approximately   1.9 million   shares of common stock through the continuous equity offering program, at a weighted average price of   $43.14   per share for proceeds of approximately   $80.6 million  , net of offering expenses. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding developments and redevelopments and repaying debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   3.1 million   shares of common stock remain available to be issued under the current offering.  We did not issue any shares of common stock under the current or previously registered offering programs during   2015  . 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we issued approximately   63,000   and   87,000   shares of common stock in each corresponding period related to vested shares of restricted stock, phantom shares and stock option exercises. 
  Operating Partnership 
  OP Units 
  For each share of common stock issued by DCT, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding OP Unit to DCT in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuances. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , DCT owned approximately   96.1%   and   95.6%  , respectively, of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership. The remaining common partnership interests in the Operating Partnership were owned by executives of the Company and non-affiliated limited partners. 
  DCT holds its interests through both general and limited partner units. The Partnership Agreement stipulates the general partner shall at all times own a minimum of   1.0%   of all outstanding OP Units. As a result, each reporting period certain of DCT s limited partner units are converted to general partner units to satisfy this requirement as illustrated in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Capital. 
  Limited partners have the right to require the Company to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) provided that such OP Units have been outstanding for at least one year. The Company may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Shares Amount (generally one share of DCT s common stock for each OP Unit), as defined in the Partnership Agreement. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , approximately   0.5 million   and   0.2 million   OP Units were redeemed for approximately   $1.9 million   and   $1.7 million   in cash and approximately   0.5 million   and   0.1 million   shares of DCT common stock, respectively. The OP Unit redemptions exclude LTIP Unit redemptions, see "LTIP Units" below for a summary of LTIP Unit redemptions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   3.7 million   and   4.0 million   OP Units were issued, outstanding and held by entities other than DCT in each corresponding period, including approximately   0.7 million   and   0.6 million   vested LTIP Units issued under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate redemption value of the then-outstanding OP Units held by entities other than DCT was approximately   $177.5 million   and   $150.9 million   based on the   $48.55   and   $37.37   per share closing price of DCT s common stock on   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Equity-Based Compensation 
  On October 10, 2006, the Company established the Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, to grant restricted stock, stock options and other awards to our personnel and directors, as defined in the plan. Awards granted under this plan are measured at fair value on the grant date and amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period during which the awards fully vest. Such expense is included in  General and administrative  expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  
   22 

Restricted Stock 
  Holders of restricted stock have voting rights and rights to receive dividends. Restricted stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of and is subject to a risk of forfeiture prior to the expiration of the applicable vesting period. Restricted stock is recorded at fair value on the date of grant and amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period during which the stock vests. Restricted stock generally vests ratably over a period of   four   or   five   years, depending on the grant. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we granted approximately   0.1 million   shares of restricted stock to certain officers and employees at the weighted average fair market value of   $36.25   per share. 
  LTIP Units 
  Pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, the Company may grant limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership called LTIP Units. Vested LTIP Units may be redeemed by the Company in cash or DCT common stock, at the discretion of the Company, on a one-for-one basis with common shares, subject to certain restrictions of the Partnership Agreement. LTIP Units receive distributions equally along with common shares. LTIP Units are valued by reference to the value of DCT s common stock and generally vest ratably over a period of   four   to   five   years, depending on the grant. LTIP Unit equity compensation is amortized into expense over the service period during which the units vest. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , approximately   0.2 million   LTIP Units were granted to certain senior executives, which vest over a   four   year period with a total fair value of approximately   $6.3 million   at the date of grant as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a volatility factor of   23%   and risk-free interest rate of   1.28%  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   112,000   vested LTIP Units converted into approximately   112,000   shares of DCT common stock and approximately   13,000   LTIP Units were redeemed for approximately   $0.5 million   in cash. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   1.2 million   LTIP Units were outstanding of which approximately   0.7 million   were vested. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , approximately   0.2 million   LTIP Units were granted to certain senior executives, which vest over a   four   year period with a total fair value of approximately   $7.3 million   at the date of grant as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a weighted average volatility factor of   26%   and a weighted average risk-free interest rate of   1.28%  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , approximately   5,000   vested LTIP Units were converted into approximately   5,000   shares of DCT common stock. As of   September 30, 2015  , approximately   1.1 million   LTIP Units were outstanding of which approximately   0.6 million   were vested. 

Note 9   Related Party Transactions 
  Southern California Consolidated Ventures 
  We entered into   four   agreements,   two   in December 2010 and   two   in January 2011, whereby we acquired a weighted average ownership interest, based on square feet, of approximately   48.4%   in   five   bulk-industrial buildings located in the Southern California market. Entities controlled by a former executive have a weighted average ownership in these properties of approximately   43.7%  , based on square feet, and the remaining   7.9%   is held by a third-party. Each venture partner will earn returns in accordance with their ownership interests. We have controlling rights including management of the operations of the properties and we have consolidated the properties in accordance with GAAP. The total acquisition price of   $46.3 million   was determined to be at fair value. 

Note 10   Earnings per Share/Unit 
  We use the two-class method of computing net earnings per common share/unit which is an earnings allocation formula that determines net earnings per share/unit for common stock/unit and any participating securities according to dividends declared (whether paid or unpaid) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under the two-class method, net earnings per common share/unit are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders/OP Unitholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders/OP Unitholders by the weighted average number of common shares/units outstanding for the period. 
  A participating security is defined by GAAP as an unvested share-based payment award containing non-forfeitable rights to dividends and must be included in the computation of earnings per share/unit pursuant to the two-class method. Nonvested restricted stock and LTIP Units are considered participating securities as these share-based awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends irrespective of whether the awards ultimately vest or expire.

  Potentially Dilutive Shares 
  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , DCT excluded from diluted earnings per share the weighted average common share equivalents related to   3.8 million   and   4.0 million   OP Units, respectively, because their effect would be anti-dilutive. During the same periods ended   September 30, 2015  , DCT excluded from diluted earnings per share the weighted average common share equivalents related to   4.2 million   and   4.3 million   OP Units because their effect would be anti-dilutive. 

Note 11   Segment Information 
  The Company s segments are based on our internal reporting of operating results used to assess performance based on our properties  geographical markets. Our markets are aggregated into   three   reportable regions or segments, East, Central and West, which are based on the geographical locations of our properties. Management considers rental revenues and property net operating income aggregated by segment to be the appropriate way to analyze performance. 
  The following table presents our total assets, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, by segment (in thousands):

The following table presents property net operating income ( NOI ) of our segments and a reconciliation of our property NOI to our reported  Net income attributable to common stockholders  (in thousands):     

(1)   
    Property net operating income ( property NOI ) is defined as rental revenues, which includes expense reimbursements, less rental expenses and real estate taxes, and excludes institutional capital management fees, depreciation, amortization, casualty and involuntary conversion gain (loss), impairment, general and administrative expenses, equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures, interest expense, interest and other income and income tax expense and other taxes. We consider property NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure because property NOI reflects the operating performance of our properties and excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties such as amortization, depreciation, impairment, interest expense, interest and other income, income tax expense and other taxes and general and administrative expenses.  However, property NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations.  Further, our property NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating property NOI.  Therefore, we believe net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most appropriate measure to evaluate our overall financial performance.   

Note 12   Assets Held for Sale 
  As of September 30, 2016,   three   properties in our East operating segment were classified as held for sale and are reported at their lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell. We expect to complete the sale of these properties in 2016. 
   
  Note 13   Subsequent Events 
  GAAP requires an entity to disclose events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued ( subsequent events ) as well as the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events. There are two types of subsequent events. The first type consists of events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements, ( recognized subsequent events ). The second type consists of events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose subsequent to that date ( nonrecognized subsequent events ). No significant recognized or nonrecognized subsequent events were noted.

Overview 
  DCT Industrial Trust Inc. is a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the ownership, acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk-distribution and light-industrial properties located in high-demand distribution markets in the United States. DCT's actively managed portfolio is strategically located near population centers and well-positioned to take advantage of market dynamics. As used herein, the terms  Company,   we,   our  and  us  refer to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP. When we use the term  DCT  or  DCT Industrial,  we are referring to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries, and when we use the term  Operating Partnership,  we are referring to DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries. 
  DCT was formed as a Maryland corporation in April 2002 and has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. DCT owns properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of   September 30, 2016  , DCT owned approximately   96.1%   of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned interests in approximately   73.5 million   square feet of properties leased to approximately   900   customers, including: 
             
    64.7 million   square feet comprising   398   consolidated operating properties, including   three   buildings totaling   0.8 million   square feet classified as held for sale, that were   96.2%   occupied; 
                
    7.8 million   square feet comprising   23   unconsolidated properties that were   97.2%   occupied and which we operated on behalf of   three   institutional capital management partners;  
                
    0.6 million   square feet comprising   four   consolidated properties under redevelopment; and 
                
    0.4 million   square feet comprising   three   consolidated properties in development. 
     In addition, the Company has   seven   projects under construction and several projects in pre-development. See  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3   Investment in Properties  for further details related to our development activity. 
  Our primary business objectives are to maximize long-term growth in Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined on page 46, net asset value of our portfolio and total shareholder returns. In our pursuit of these long-term objectives, we seek to: 
             
    maximize cash flows from existing properties; 
                
    deploy capital into quality acquisitions and development opportunities which meet our asset, location and financial criteria; and 
                
    recycle capital by selling assets that no longer fit our investment criteria and reinvesting the proceeds into higher growth opportunities. 
     Outlook 
  We seek to maximize long-term earnings growth per share and shareholder value primarily through increasing occupancy, rents and operating income at existing properties and developing and acquiring high-quality properties with attractive operating income and value growth prospects. Fundamentals for industrial real estate continue to improve in response to general improvement in the economy as well as trends that particularly favor industrial assets, including the growth of e-commerce. We expect moderate economic growth to continue through 2016, which should result in continued positive demand for warehouse space as companies expand and upgrade their distribution and production platforms. 
  In response to positive net absorption and lower market vacancy levels, rental rates are increasing in most of our markets. Rental concessions, such as free rent, have declined in recent years and remain at historically low levels. Consistent with recent experience and based on current market conditions, we expect average net effective rental rates on new leases signed during the remainder of 2016 to be higher than the rates on expiring leases. 
  
   28 

New development, including speculative development, is present in most markets in response to strong tenant demand for high-quality space. However, construction remains below current levels of net absorption in most markets and below historical peak levels. We expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for lessors given our favorable outlook for market occupancy levels and rental rate growth. 
  We expect our same store net operating income to be higher in 2016 than it was in 2015, primarily as a result of higher occupancy in 2016 and the impact of increasing rental rates on leases signed in 2016 compared to expiring leases. 
  In terms of capital investment, we will pursue the selective development of new buildings and the opportunistic acquisition of buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns. 
  We anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of non-strategic assets to fund our investment in developments and acquisitions in an effort to enhance long-term growth in our net asset value, earnings and cash flows as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio. 
  We anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our operating expenses, including costs to maintain our properties and distributions, though we may finance investments, including acquisitions and developments, with the issuance of new common shares, proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings. Please see  Liquidity and Capital Resources  for additional discussion. 
  Inflation 
  The U.S. economy has experienced low inflation over the past several years and as a result, inflation has not had a significant impact on our business. Moreover, most of our leases require the customers to pay their share of the cost to operate our properties, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. In addition, most of our leases expire within five years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at then-existing market rates. While slowing global growth has the potential to dampen demand for distribution space, we have not yet seen any indications of this reduced demand. 
  Summary of Significant Transactions and Activities for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016    
             
    Acquisition Activities 
                
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we acquired   four   buildings comprising   0.6 million   square feet in the Cincinnati, Dallas and Southern California markets for a total purchase price of approximately   $42.5 million  . Weighted average occupancy upon the acquisition of the properties was   81.1%  . 
                
    Development Activities 
                
    As of   September 30, 2016  , construction was shell-complete on   three   buildings totaling   0.4 million   square feet in the Dallas, Orlando and Seattle markets.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we stabilized   13   buildings totaling   4.5 million   square feet, including one building in our unconsolidated Stirling Capital Investments joint venture. 
                
    Additionally, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we acquired   65.1 acres   of   land in the Baltimore/Washington D.C., Dallas and Denver markets   for approximately   $11.6 million   that is held for future development.

The table below reflects a summary of development activities as of   September 30, 2016  , (in thousands, except acres and number of buildings): 

(1)   
    Percentage owned is based on equity ownership weighted by square feet. 
               (2)   
    The completion date represents the date of building shell-completion or estimated date of shell-completion. 
               (3)   
    Percentage leased is computed as of the date the financial statements were available to be issued. 
        Dispositions 
             
    During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , there were no dispositions of consolidated operating properties. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold   11   consolidated operating properties totaling   2.0 million   square feet from our   Chicago, Houston, Louisville and Northern California markets   to third-parties for gross proceeds of approximately   $108.6 million  . 
        Significant Activity from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
             
    During September 2016, the TRT-DCT Venture III disposed of one property. We received approximately   $0.5 million   for our share of the gross proceeds and recognized our share of the gain on the sale of approximately   $0.1 million  , which is included in "Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        Debt Activity 
             
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   balance outstanding and   $396.5 million   available under our   $400.0 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of   one   letter of credit totaling   $3.5 million  . 
                
    On August 8, 2016, we issued   $250.0 million   of fixed rate senior unsecured notes in a private placement offering. The notes have an average term of 10 years, a weighted average interest rate of 3.90% and require semi-annual interest payments. We primarily used the proceeds to paydown our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, payoff a   $49.0 million   senior unsecured note at maturity and payoff a portion of our $25.0 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in April 2017. 
        Equity Activity 
             
    On September 10, 2015, we registered a continuous equity offering program, to replace our continuous equity offering program previously registered on May 29, 2013. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued approximately   1.9 million   shares of common stock through the continuous equity offering program, at a weighted average price of   $43.14   per share for proceeds of approximately   $80.6 million  , net of offering expenses. The proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock were contributed to the Operating Partnership for an equal number of OP units in the Operating Partnership and were used for general corporate purposes, including funding developments and redevelopments and repaying debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   3.1 million   shares of common stock remain available to be issued under the current offering.

Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, customers who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases. In the event that a customer with a significant number of leases in our properties files bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a reduction in our revenues and an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. 
  We frequently monitor the financial condition of our customers. We communicate often with those customers that have been late on payments or filed bankruptcy. We are not currently aware of any significant financial difficulties of any tenants that would cause a material reduction in our revenues. 
   
  Results of Operations  
  Summary of the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods ended   September 30, 2015 
  We are a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the ownership, acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk-distribution and light-industrial properties located in high-demand distribution markets in the United States. Our actively managed portfolio is strategically located near population centers and well-positioned to take advantage of market dynamics. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned interests in or had under development approximately   73.5 million   square feet of properties leased to approximately   900   customers, including   7.8 million   square feet managed on behalf of   three   institutional capital management joint venture partners. As of   September 30, 2016  , we consolidated   395   operating properties,   three   development properties,   four   redevelopment properties and three consolidated operating properties classified as held for sale. As of   September 30, 2015  , we consolidated   404   operating properties,   eight   development properties,   four   redevelopment properties and one consolidated operating property classified as held for sale. 
  Comparison of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following table presents the changes in rental revenues, rental expenses and real estate taxes, property net operating income, other revenue and other income, and other expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our same store portfolio includes all operating properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods. We consider same store properties to be a useful measure to improve comparability between periods by excluding the effects of changes in our consolidated operating properties period over period. Developed properties are generally included in same store properties once they are initially stabilized. We generally consider buildings stabilized when occupancy reaches 90%. Non-same store operating properties include properties not meeting the same store criteria and exclude development and redevelopment properties. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we had 366 properties classified as same store comprising   56.1 million   square feet and 39 classified as non-same store consisting of properties that did not meet our same store definition, which includes 32 operating properties and seven development and redevelopment properties that were not stabilized. A discussion of these changes follows in the table below (in thousands): 

32 

(1)   
    Property net operating income ( NOI ) is defined as rental revenues, which includes expense reimbursements, less rental expenses and real estate taxes, and excludes institutional capital management fees, depreciation, amortization, casualty and involuntary conversion gain (loss), impairment, general and administrative expenses, equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures, interest expense, interest and other income and income tax expense and other taxes. We consider property NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure because property NOI reflects the operating performance of our properties and excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties such as amortization, depreciation, impairment, interest expense, interest and other income, income tax expense and other taxes and general and administrative expenses.  However, property NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations.  Further, our property NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating property NOI.  Therefore, we believe net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most appropriate measure to evaluate our overall financial performance. For a reconciliation of our NOI to our reported  Net income attributable to common stockholders  see  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11   Segment Information.  
     
   33 

Rental Revenues 
  Rental revenues, which are comprised of base rent, straight-line rent, amortization of above and below market rent intangibles, tenant recovery income, other rental income and early lease termination fees,   increased   by   $11.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to the following: 
             
    $6.9 million     increase   in total revenue in our non-same store portfolio, of which $12.0 million is attributed to seven operating property acquisitions, 25 development and redevelopment properties placed into operation since July 1, 2015, offset in part by a $4.8 million decrease attributed to 28 consolidated property dispositions since July 1, 2015 and $0.3 million attributed to two properties under development and redevelopment that were in our operating portfolio prior to July 1, 2015. 
                
    $4.9 million     increase   in total revenue in our same store portfolio primarily due to the following: 
                
    $3.3 million increase in base rent primarily resulting from increased rental rates and a 120 basis point increase in average occupancy period over period; 
                
    $1.4 million increase in operating expense recoveries related to higher average occupancy and increases in property tax expense; and 
                
    $1.1 million increase in miscellaneous income from tenants primarily due to higher move-out repairs in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015; which was partially offset by 
                
    $0.9 million decrease in early lease termination fees primarily attributable to four tenants in 2015. 
     The following table presents the various components of our consolidated rental revenues (in thousands): 

Rental Expenses and Real Estate Taxes 
  Rental expenses and real estate taxes, which are comprised of insurance, common area maintenance, utilities, property management fees and other rental expenses, and real estate taxes,   increased   by   $0.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to the following: 
             
    $0.3 million     increase   in rental expenses and real estate taxes period over period in our same store portfolio primarily due to an increase in property taxes in our Chicago and Houston markets; and 
                
    $0.6 million     increase   in rental expenses and real estate taxes related to our non-same store properties primarily due to an increase in property taxes in our Houston and Southern California markets. 
     The following table presents the various components of our rental expenses and real estate taxes (in thousands):   

34 

Other Revenue and Other Income 
  Total other revenue and other income   decreased     $0.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to the following: 
             
    $3.3 million     decrease   primarily related to $3.7 million of gain recognized on the sale of one property in the unconsolidated IDI/DCT, LLC joint venture during 2015, offset in part by increased earnings from our unconsolidated investments in Stirling Capital Investments and DCT/SPF Industrial Operating LLC joint ventures due to increased occupancy; which was partially offset by 
                
    $2.4 million   increase in casualty gains primarily related to an insurance settlement from a casualty event at one property in our Dallas market during 2016 with no corresponding activity during 2015. 
     Other Expenses 
  Other expenses   increased     $2.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015  , primarily due to the following: 
             
    $2.7 million     increase   in interest expense due to the following:

    $1.5 million increase due to increased average outstanding indebtedness of approximately $55.3 million and a higher weighted average effective interest rate during 2016 compared to the same period in 2015; which was partially offset by

Comparison of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following table presents the changes in rental revenues, rental expenses and real estate taxes, property net operating income, other revenue and other income, and other expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Our same store portfolio includes all operating properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods. We consider same store properties to be a useful measure to improve comparability between periods by excluding the effects of changes in our consolidated operating properties period over period. Developed properties are generally included in same store properties once they are initially stabilized. We generally consider buildings stabilized when occupancy reaches 90%. Non-same store operating properties include properties not meeting the same store criteria and exclude development and redevelopment properties. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   we had 348 properties classified as same store comprising   53.4 million   square feet and 57 classified as non-same store consisting of properties that did not meet our same store definition, which includes 50 operating properties and seven development and redevelopment properties that were not stabilized. A discussion of these changes follows in the table below (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for potential capital requirements for expansions and renovation of properties, developments, acquisitions, and debt service and distributions to shareholders will include: 
             
    Cash flows from operations; 
                
    Proceeds from dispositions; 
                
    Borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility; 
                
    Other forms of secured or unsecured financings; 
                
    Offerings of common stock or other securities; 
                
    Current cash balances; and 
                
    Distributions from institutional capital management and other joint ventures. 
     Our sources of capital will be used to meet our liquidity requirements and capital commitments, including operating activities, debt service obligations, equity holder distributions, capital expenditures at our properties, development funding requirements and future acquisitions. We expect to utilize the same sources of capital to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements. 
  Cash Flows 
   Cash and cash equivalents  were   $7.1 million   and   $18.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Net cash provided by operating activities   increased     $6.7 million   to   $158.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $151.7 million   during the same period in   2015  . This change was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income attributable to acquired properties, development and redevelopment properties placed into operation and operating performance at existing properties. 
  Net cash used in investing activities   decreased     $10.6 million   to   $164.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $175.1 million   during the same period in   2015   primarily due to the following activities: 
             
    $100.2 million   decrease in cash outflows from acquisitions; and 
                
    $28.4 million   decrease in cash inflows related to the utilization of all 1031 proceeds received from dispositions; partially offset by 
                
    $67.4 million   increase in cash outflows related to capital expenditures and development activities, as reflected in the table below; 
     
   41 

$30.0 million   decrease in cash inflows from dispositions;  
                
    $14.2 million   increase in cash outflows related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures due to increased contributions to our Stirling Capital Investments unconsolidated joint venture to fund the development of SCLA Building 13B during 2016; and 
                
    $8.0 million   decrease in cash inflows from distributions of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures primarily due to cash inflows of approximately $8.1 million for our share of gross proceeds, less the payoff of the mortgage note, from the disposition of one property by IDI/DCT, LLC in 2015. 
     We pursue the acquisition of buildings and land and consider selective development of new buildings in markets where we perceive that demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns. The amount of cash used related to acquisitions and development and redevelopment investments will vary from period to period based on a number of factors, including, among others, current and anticipated future market conditions impacting the desirability of investments, leasing results with respect to our existing development and redevelopment projects and our ability to locate attractive opportunities. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Summary of Significant Transactions and Activities for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Development Activities  for further details regarding projected investment of our current development activities as well as cumulative costs incurred as of   September 30, 2016  . Our total capital expenditures were comprised of the following (in thousands): 

We capitalize costs directly related to the development, pre-development, redevelopment or improvement of our investments in real estate. Building and land improvements comprise capital expenditures related to maintaining our consolidated operating activities. Due diligence capital improvements relate to acquired operating properties and are generally incurred within 12 months of the acquisition date. 
  We capitalize indirect costs such as personnel, office and administrative expenses that are directly related to our development projects, redevelopment projects and successful origination of new leases based on an estimate of the time spent on the development and leasing activities. The total of these capitalized costs was comprised of the following (in thousands): 

In addition, we capitalize interest costs incurred associated with development and construction activities. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   total interest capitalized was   $7.6 million   and   $12.1 million  , respectively. 
  Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities   decreased   $20.8 million to   $5.2 million   net cash used in financing activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $15.6 million   net cash provided by financing activities during the same period in   2015   primarily due to the following activities: 
   
   42 

$250.0 million increase in cash inflows resulting from the issuance of our fixed rate senior unsecured notes in August 2016; and 
                
    $40.0 million repayment of our senior unsecured note in June 2015; which was partially offset by  
                
    $50.0 million decrease due to the repayment of our senior unsecured fixed rate note in April 2016; 
                
    $49.0 million decrease due to the repayment of our senior unsecured fixed rate note in August 2016; and

     Common Stock    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   90.9 million   shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. 
  On September 10, 2015, we registered a continuous equity offering program, to replace our continuous equity offering program previously registered on May 29, 2013. Pursuant to this offering, we may sell up to five million shares of common stock from time-to-time through September 10, 2018 in  at-the-market  offerings or certain other transactions. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued approximately   1.9 million   shares of common stock through the continuous equity offering program, at a weighted average price of   $43.14   per share for proceeds of approximately   $80.6 million  , net of offering expenses. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding developments and redevelopments and repaying debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   3.1 million   shares of common stock remain available to be issued under the current offering. 
  OP Units 
  Limited partners have the right to require the Company to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership ( Partnership Agreement )). DCT may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Shares Amount (generally one share of DCT s common stock for each OP Unit), as defined in the Partnership Agreement. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, approximately   0.5 million   and   0.2 million   OP Units were redeemed for approximately   $1.9 million   and   $1.7 million   in cash and approximately   0.5 million   and   0.1 million   shares of DCT common stock, respectively.

  Our debt instruments require monthly, quarterly or semiannual payments of interest and mortgages generally require monthly or quarterly repayments of principal. Currently, cash flows from our operations are sufficient to satisfy these debt service requirements and we anticipate that cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient to satisfy our debt service excluding principal maturities, which we plan to fund from refinancing and/or new debt. 
  Line of Credit 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   balance outstanding and   $396.5 million   available under our   $400.0 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of   one   letter of credit totaling   $3.5 million  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had   $70.0 million   outstanding and   $326.5 million   available under our   $400.0 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of   one   letter of credit totaling   $3.5 million  . 
  The senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement contains various covenants with which we were in compliance as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Debt Maturities 
  The following table presents the scheduled maturities of our debt and regularly scheduled principal amortization, excluding unamortized premiums, discounts and deferred loan costs, as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1)   
    The term loan facilities are presented in  Senior unsecured notes  in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
     Financing Strategy 
  We do not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt we incur, although we currently intend to operate so that our financial metrics are generally consistent with investment grade peers in the real estate industry. We continually evaluate our secured and unsecured leverage and among other relevant metrics, our fixed charge coverage ratio. Our charter and our bylaws do not limit the indebtedness that we may incur. We are, however, subject to certain covenants which may limit our outstanding  
  
   44 

indebtedness. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  The following table presents our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  , specifically our obligations under long-term debt agreements, operating lease agreements and ground lease agreements (in thousands): 

(1)   
    From time-to-time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, such as maintenance agreements at our properties. Such contracts, in the aggregate, do not represent material obligations, are typically short-term and cancellable within 90 days and are not included in the table above. Also, excluded from the total are our estimated construction costs to complete development and redevelopment projects of approximately   $110.0 million  . 
               (2)   
    Variable interest rate payments are estimated based on the LIBOR rate at   September 30, 2016  . 
               (3)   
    Three of our buildings comprising 0.7 million square feet reside on 38 acres of land, which is leased from an airport authority. 
     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than those disclosed under contractual obligations, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors, other than items discussed herein. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our proportionate share of the total construction loans of our unconsolidated development joint ventures was   $35.3 million  , which is scheduled to mature during 2017. Our proportionate share of the total construction loans, including undrawn amounts, of our unconsolidated development joint ventures includes 50.0% of the construction loans associated with the SCLA joint venture which are non-recourse to the venture partners. 
  Indebtedness and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  There are no lines of credit or side agreements related to, or between, our unconsolidated joint ventures and us, and there are no other derivative financial instruments between our unconsolidated joint ventures and us. In addition, we believe we have no material exposure to financial guarantees, except as discussed above. 
  We may elect to fund additional capital to a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such funding is not required contractually or otherwise. As of   September 30, 2016  , our proportionate share of non-recourse debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures is   $35.3 million  . The maturities of our proportionate share of the non-recourse debt are summarized in the table below (in thousands):

Funds From Operations 
  DCT Industrial believes that net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure.  However, DCT Industrial considers funds from operations ( FFO ), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), to be a useful supplemental, non-GAAP measure of DCT Industrial s operating performance.  NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP.  FFO is generally defined as net income attributable to common stockholders, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, less gains from dispositions of operating real estate held for investment purposes, plus impairment losses on depreciable real estate and impairments of in substance real estate investments in investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of the depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and adjustments to derive DCT Industrial s proportionate share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures.  We exclude gains and losses on business combinations and include the gains or losses from dispositions of properties which were acquired or developed with the intention to sell or contribute to an investment fund in our definition of FFO.  Although the NAREIT definition of FFO predates the guidance for accounting for gains and losses on business combinations, we believe that excluding such gains and losses is consistent with the key objective of FFO as a performance measure.  We also present FFO, as adjusted, which excludes hedge ineffectiveness, certain severance costs, acquisition costs, debt modification costs and impairment losses on properties which are not depreciable.  We believe that FFO excluding hedge ineffectiveness, certain severance costs, acquisition costs, debt modification costs and impairment losses on non-depreciable real estate is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a more meaningful and consistent comparison of our operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results.  Readers should note that FFO captures neither the changes in the value of DCT Industrial s properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of DCT Industrial s properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact DCT Industrial s results from operations. NAREIT s definition of FFO is subject to interpretation, and modifications to the NAREIT definition of FFO are common. Accordingly, DCT Industrial s FFO may not be comparable to other REITs  FFO and FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of DCT Industrial s performance.

The following table presents the calculation of our FFO reconciled from  Net income attributable to common stockholders  (unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share and unit data):

    Equity in FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures is determined as our share of FFO from each unconsolidated joint venture.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
  Market risk is the exposure to losses resulting from changes in market prices such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and rental rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and OP unitholders and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other variable rate borrowings and forecasted fixed rate debt issuances, including refinancing of existing fixed rate debt. Interest rate risk may result from many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control. To manage interest rate risk for variable rate debt and issuances of fixed rate debt, in the past we have primarily used treasury locks and forward-starting swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy. These derivatives are designed to mitigate the risk of future interest rate increases by providing a fixed interest rate for a limited, pre-determined period of time. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors. 
  During   June 2013  , certain of our consolidated ventures entered into   two   pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1 month USD LIBOR rates. The pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps have an effective date of   June 2013   and a maturity date of   June 2023  . These interest rates swaps effectively fix the interest rate on the related debt instruments at   4.72%  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had borrowings payable subject to these pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps with aggregate principal balances of approximately   $6.7 million   and $6.8 million, respectively.     
  During   December 2015  , we entered into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1 month LIBOR rates on our   $200.0 million   unsecured term loan. The pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap has an effective date of   December 2015   and a maturity date of   December 2022  . The interest rate swap effectively fixes the interest rate on the related debt instrument at   3.31%  , however, there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt is subject to a   0.0%   floor. While LIBOR rates in certain foreign countries have been or are currently negative, USD LIBOR rates in the US have never been negative nor do we expect them to become negative in the future. In the event that USD LIBOR is negative, the Company will make payments to the hedge counterparty equal to the spread between USD LIBOR and zero. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded a non-cash charge of approximately   $0.5 million   of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to a 0.0% floor mismatch in the hedging relationships (i.e., there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt from which the hedged forecasted transactions are expected to flow is subject to a 0.0% floor on the USD LIBOR component of the interest rate). As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had borrowings payable subject to this pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap with aggregate principal balances of approximately   $200.0 million  .  See  Notes to a Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5   Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities  for additional information. 
  Our variable rate debt is subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $150.0 million   of variable rate debt outstanding indexed to LIBOR rates. If the LIBOR rates relevant to our variable rate debt were to increase 10%, we estimate that our interest expense during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   would have increased approximately $0.2 million based on our outstanding floating-rate debt as of   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, if weighted average interest rates on our fixed rate debt were to have increased by 100 basis points due to refinancing, interest expense would have increased by approximately $9.7 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of our debt was approximately   $1.7 billion   based on our estimate of the then-current market interest rates.
