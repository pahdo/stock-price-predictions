NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

General 

The
accompanying condensed unaudited financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q for quarterly
reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for complete financial statements. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. For
further information, refer to the financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in the Partnership's annual report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. 

Organization 

WNC
Housing Tax Credit Fund VI, L.P., Series 10 (the
 Partnership ) is a California Limited Partnership
formed under the laws of the State of California on July 17, 2001,
and commenced operations on February 28, 2003. The Partnership was
formed to acquire limited partnership interests in other limited
partnerships ("Local Limited Partnerships") which own multi-family
housing complexes ( Housing Complexes ) that are
eligible for Federal low income housing tax credits ( Low
Income Housing Tax Credits ). The local general partners (the
 Local General Partners ) of each Local Limited
Partnership retain responsibility for maintaining, operating and
managing the Housing Complex. Each Local Limited Partnership is
governed by its agreement of limited partnership (the  Local
Limited Partnership Agreement ). 

The
general partner of the Partnership is WNC   Associates, Inc.
( Associates  or the  General Partner ).
The chairman and the president of Associates own all of the
outstanding stock of Associates. The business of the Partnership is
conducted primarily through the General Partner, as the Partnership
has no employees of its own. 

The
Partnership shall continue in full force and effect until December
31, 2062, unless terminated prior to that date, pursuant to the
partnership agreement or law. 

The
financial statements include only activity relating to the business
of the Partnership, and do not give effect to any assets that the
partners may have outside of their interests in the Partnership, or
to any obligations, including income taxes, of the
partners. 

The
partnership agreement authorized the sale of up to 25,000 units of
limited partnership interest ( Partnership Units ) at
$1,000 per Partnership Unit. The offering of Partnership Units has
concluded, and 13,153 Partnership Units representing subscriptions
in the amount of $13,119,270, net of dealer discounts of $31,220
and volume discounts of $2,510, had been accepted. As of September
30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, a total of 13,128 and 13,148
Partnership Units, respectively, remain outstanding. The General
Partner has a 0.1% interest in operating profits and losses,
taxable income and losses, cash available for distribution from the
Partnership and Low Income Housing Tax Credits of the Partnership.
The investors (the  Limited Partners ) in the
Partnership will be allocated the remaining 99.9% of these items in
proportion to their respective investments. 

The
proceeds from the disposition of any of the Housing Complexes will
be used first to pay debts and other obligations per the respective
Local Limited Partnership Agreement. Any remaining proceeds will
then be paid to the Partnership. The sale of a Housing Complex may
be subject to other restrictions and obligations. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that a Local Limited Partnership will be
able to sell its Housing Complex. Even if it does so, there can be
no assurance that any significant amounts of cash will be
distributed to the Partnership. Should such distributions occur,
the Limited Partners will be entitled to receive distributions from
the proceeds remaining after payment of Partnership obligations and
funding reserves, equal to their capital contributions and their
return on investment (as defined in the Partnership Agreement). The
General Partner would then   be entitled to
receive proceeds equal to its capital contributions from the
remainder. Any additional sale or refinancing proceeds will be
distributed 90% to the Limited Partners (in proportion to their
respective investments) and 10% to the General
Partner.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,

Risks and Uncertainties 

An
investment in the Partnership and the Partnership s
investments in Local Limited Partnerships and their Housing
Complexes are subject to risks. These risks may impact the tax
benefits of an investment in the Partnership, and the amount of
proceeds available for distribution to the Limited Partners, if
any, on liquidation of the Partnership s investments. Some of
those risks include the following: 

The Low
Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated.
Noncompliance with these rules results in the loss of future Low
Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low
Income Housing Tax Credits already taken. In most cases the annual
amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use
is limited to the tax liability due on the person s last
$25,000 of taxable income. The Local Limited Partnerships may be
unable to sell the Housing Complexes at a price which would result
in the Partnership realizing cash distributions or proceeds from
the transaction. Accordingly, the Partnership may be unable to
distribute any cash to its limited partners. Low Income Housing Tax
Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in the
Partnership. 

The
Partnership has invested in a limited number of Local Limited
Partnerships. Such limited diversity means that the results of
operation of each single Housing Complex will have a greater impact
on the Partnership. With limited diversity, poor performance of one
Housing Complex could impair the Partnership s ability to
satisfy its investment objectives. Each Housing Complex is subject
to mortgage indebtedness. If a Local Limited Partnership failed to
pay its mortgage, it could lose its Housing Complex in foreclosure.
If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years (the
 Compliance Period ), the loss of any remaining future
Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of prior Low
Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of the Partnership s
investment in the Housing Complex would occur. The Partnership is a
limited partner or a non-managing member of each Local Limited
Partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership will have very limited
rights with respect to management of the Local Limited
Partnerships. The Partnership will rely totally on the Local
General Partners. Neither the Partnership s investments in
Local Limited Partnerships, nor the Local Limited
Partnerships  investments in Housing Complexes, are readily
marketable. To the extent the Housing Complexes receive government
financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or
more of the following risks: difficulties in obtaining tenants for
the Housing Complexes; difficulties in obtaining rent increases;
limitations on cash distributions; limitations on sales or
refinancing of Housing Complexes; limitations on transfers of
interests in Local Limited Partnerships; limitations on removal of
Local General Partners; limitations on subsidy programs; and
possible changes in applicable regulations. Uninsured casualties
could result in loss of property and Low Income Housing Tax Credits
and recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits previously taken.
The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating
economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax,
environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of
similar properties, and neighborhood conditions, among
others. 

The
ability of Limited Partners to claim tax losses from the
Partnership is limited. The IRS may audit the Partnership or a
Local Limited Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax
items. The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses
allocable to the limited partners could be reduced if the IRS were
successful in such a challenge. The alternative minimum tax could
reduce tax benefits from an investment in the Partnership. Changes
in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment
in the Partnership and/or the value of the Housing
Complexes. 

The
Partnership currently has insufficient working capital to fund its
operations. Associates has agreed to continue providing advances
sufficient enough to fund the operations and working capital
requirements of the Partnership through November 30,
2017. 

Anticipated
future and existing cash resources of the Partnership are not
sufficient to pay existing liabilities of the Partnership. However,
substantially all of the existing liabilities of the Partnership
are payable to the General Partner and/or its affiliates. Though
the amounts payable to the General Partner and/or its affiliates
are contractually currently payable, the Partnership anticipates
that the General Partner and/or its affiliates will not require the
payment of these contractual obligations until capital 
 reserves are in
excess of the aggregate of then existing contractual obligations
and then anticipated future foreseeable obligations of the
Partnership. The Partnership would be adversely affected should the
General Partner and/or its affiliates demand current payment of the
existing contractual obligations and or suspend services for this
or any other reason.

No
trading market for the Partnership Units exists or is expected to
develop. Limited Partners may be unable to sell their Partnership
Units except at a discount and should consider their Partnership
Units to be a long-term investment. Individual Limited Partners
will have no recourse if they disagree with actions authorized by a
vote of the majority of Limited Partners. 

Exit Strategy 

The
Compliance Period for a Housing Complex is generally 15 years
following construction or rehabilitation completion. Associates was
one of the first in the industry to offer syndicated investments in
Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The initial programs have completed
their Compliance Periods. 

Upon
the sale of a Local Limited Partnership Interest or Housing Complex
after the end of the Compliance Period, there would be no recapture
of Low Income Housing Tax Credits. A sale prior to the end of the
Compliance Period could result in recapture if certain conditions
are not met. None of the remaining Housing Complexes have completed
their 15-year Compliance Period. 

With
that in mind, the General Partner is continuing its review of the
Housing Complexes. The review considers many factors, including
extended use requirements (such as those due to mortgage
restrictions or state compliance agreements), the condition of the
Housing Complexes, and the tax consequences to the Limited Partners
from the sale of the Housing Complexes. 

Upon
identifying those Housing Complexes with the highest potential for
a successful sale, refinancing or re-syndication, the Partnership
expects to proceed with efforts to liquidate them. The objective is
to maximize the Limited Partners  return wherever possible
and, ultimately, to wind down the Partnership as Low Income Housing
Tax Credits are no longer available. Local Limited Partnership
interests may be disposed of any time by the General Partner in its
discretion. While liquidation of the Housing Complexes continues to
be evaluated, the dissolution of the Partnership was not imminent
as of September 30, 2016. 

As of
March 31, 2016, the Partnership sold its Local Limited Partnership
interest in FDI-Green Manor 2003 ( Green Manor ) and
FDI-Pine Meadows 2003 ( Pine Meadows ). The Compliance
Periods for Green Manor and Pine Meadows expire in 2018. Recapture
Guarantee Surety Bonds were issued to the Purchasers to guarantee
the repayment of the recaptured tax credits and interests arising
from any non-compliance as provided in Section 42 of the Internal
Revenue Code arising after the date of the sale. 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Partnership has identified the following
Local Limited Partnerships for possible disposition. 

*
Estimated price and close date has yet to be determined. The Local
Limited Partnership is not under contract to be purchased as of the
report filing.

The
proceeds from the disposition of any of the Housing Complexes will
be used first to pay debts and other obligations per the respective
Local Limited Partnership Agreement. Any remaining proceeds will
then be paid to the partners of the Local Limited Partnership,
including the Partnership, in accordance with the terms of the
particular Local Limited Partnership Agreement. The sale of a
Housing Complex may be subject to other restrictions and
obligations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a Local
Limited Partnership will be able to sell its Housing Complex. Even
if it does so, there can be no assurance that any significant
amounts of cash will be distributed to the Partnership, as the
proceeds first would be used to pay Local Limited Partnership
obligations and funding of reserves. 

Method of Accounting for Investments in Local Limited
Partnerships 

The
Partnership accounts for its investments in Local Limited
Partnerships using the equity method of accounting, whereby the
Partnership adjusts its investment balance for its share of the
Local Limited Partnerships  results of operations and for any
contributions made and distributions received. The Partnership
reviews the carrying amount of an individual investment in a Local
Limited Partnership for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such
investment may not be recoverable. Recoverability of such
investment is measured by the estimated value derived by
management, generally consisting of the sum of the remaining future
Low Income Housing Tax Credits estimated to be allocable to the
Partnership and the estimated residual value to the Partnership. If
an investment is considered to be impaired, the Partnership reduces
the carrying value of its investment in any such Local Limited
Partnership. The accounting policies of the Local Limited
Partnerships, generally, are expected to be consistent with those
of the Partnership. Costs incurred by the Partnership in acquiring
the investments were capitalized as part of the investment and were
being amortized over 30 years (see Note 2). 

Equity
in losses of Local Limited Partnerships  for each of the
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, has been
recorded by the Partnership. Management s estimate for the
three month periods is based on either actual unaudited results
reported by the Local Limited Partnerships or historical trends in
the operations of the Local Limited Partnerships. Equity in losses
from the Local Limited Partnerships allocated to the Partnership
are not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would
be adjusted below zero. If the Local Limited Partnerships report
net income in future years, the Partnership will resume applying
the equity method only after its share of such net income equals
the share of net losses not recognized during the period(s) the
equity method was suspended. 

In
accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of
variable interest entities, the Partnership determines when it
should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a
variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and
when it should disclose information about its relationship with a
VIE. The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity
should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors. A
VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets,
which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary
beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities
of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic
performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive
benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If
multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party
will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the guidance
requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a
VIE. 

Based
on this guidance, the Local Limited Partnerships in which the
Partnership invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners
of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to
direct their operations. However, management does not consolidate
the Partnership's interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered
to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to
direct the activities that are considered most significant to the
economic performance of these entities. The Partnership currently
records the amount of its investment in these Local Limited
Partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its
share of partnership income or losses in the statements of
operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of
these investments in its financial statements. The Partnership's
balance in investment in Local Limited Partnerships, plus the risk
of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these
investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss. The
Partnership's exposure to loss on these Local Limited Partnerships
is mitigated by the condition and financial performance 
 of the
underlying Housing Complexes as well as the strength of the Local
General Partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to
the investors in the Partnership

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
continued 

Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ
from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The
Partnership considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents. The Partnership had $37,612 and $41,923 of cash
equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016,
respectively. 

Reporting Comprehensive Income 

The
Partnership had no items of other comprehensive income for all
periods presented. 

Income Taxes 

The
Partnership has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for
income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes.
Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are
passed through to and are reported by its owners on their
respective income tax returns. The Partnership s federal
tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as
a partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership is not required to take
any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity.
The   Partnership is
required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal
Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. Accordingly, these
financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes
and the Partnership has no other tax positions which must be
considered for disclosure. Income tax returns filed by the
Partnership are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue
Service for a period of three years. While no income tax returns
are currently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service, tax
years since 2013 remain open. 

Net Income (Loss) Per Partnership Unit 

Net
income (loss) per Partnership Unit includes no dilution and is
computed by dividing loss available to Limited Partners by the
weighted average number of Partnership Units outstanding during the
period. Calculation of diluted net income (loss) per Partnership
Unit is not required. 

Revenue Recognition 

The
Partnership is entitled to receive reporting fees from the Local
Limited Partnerships. The intent of the reporting fees is to offset
(in part) administrative costs incurred by the Partnership in
corresponding with the Local Limited Partnerships. Due to the
uncertainty of the collection of these fees, the Partnership
recognizes reporting fees as collections are made. 

Impairment 

The
Partnership reviews its investments in Local Limited Partnerships
for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such investments
may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amount of the investment to the sum of the total
amount of the remaining Low Income   Housing Tax Credits
allocated to the Partnership and any estimated residual value of
the investment. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, impairment loss related to investments in Local Limited
Partnerships was $0 and $125,322, respectively.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
continued 

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In
January 2014, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and
disclosure requirements for investments in qualified affordable
housing projects. The amendments provide guidance on accounting for
investments by a reporting entity in flow-through limited liability
entities that manage or invest in affordable housing projects that
qualify for the low-income housing tax credit. The amendments
permit reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to
account for their investments in qualified affordable housing
projects using the proportional amortization method if certain
conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an
entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion
to the tax credits and other tax benefits received, and recognizes
the net investment performance in the income statement as a
component of income tax expense (benefit). The amendments are
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2014 and should be applied retrospectively to all periods
presented. Early adoption was permitted. The adoption of this
update did not materially affect the Partnership's financial
statements. 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.   2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810):
Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis . This will improve
certain areas of consolidation guidance for reporting organizations
that are required to evaluate whether to consolidate certain legal
entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability
corporations and securitization structures. ASU 2015-02 simplifies
and improves GAAP by: eliminating the presumption that a general
partner should consolidate a limited partnership, eliminating the
indefinite deferral of FASB Statement No. 167, thereby reducing the
number of Variable Interest Entity (VIE) consolidation models from
four to two (including the limited partnership consolidation model)
and clarifying when fees paid to a decision maker should be a
factor to include in the consolidation of VIEs. ASU 2015-02 is
effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The
adoption of this update did not materially affect the Partnership's
financial statements.

NOTE 2 - INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS 

As of
September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Partnership owned
limited partnership interests in 4 Local Limited Partnerships, each
of which owns one Housing Complex, consisting of an aggregate of
218 apartment units. The respective Local General Partners of the
Local Limited Partnerships manage the day to day operations of the
entities. Significant Local Limited Partnership business decisions,
as defined, require approval from the Partnership. The Partnership,
as a Limited Partner, is generally entitled to 99.98%, as specified
in the Local Limited Partnership agreements, of the operating
profits and losses, taxable income and losses, and tax credits of
the Local Limited Partnerships. 

The
following is a summary of the equity method activity of the
investments in Local Limited Partnerships for the periods presented
below: 

Selected
financial information for the six months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 from the unaudited combined condensed financial statements
of the Local Limited Partnerships in which the Partnership has
invested is as follows: 

Certain
Local Limited Partnerships incurred operating losses and/or have
working capital deficiencies. In the event these Local Limited
Partnerships continue to incur significant operating losses,
additional capital contributions by the Partnership and/or the
Local General Partners may be required to sustain the operations of
such Local Limited Partnerships. If additional capital
contributions are not made when they are required, the
Partnership's investment in certain of such Local Limited
Partnerships could be impaired, and the loss and recapture of the
related Low Income Housing Tax Credits could occur.

NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

Under
the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership has paid or
is obligated to the General Partner or its affiliates for the
following fees: 

(a) 

  An annual asset
management fee not to exceed 0.5% of the invested assets of the
Partnership, as defined.  Invested Assets  means the
sum of the Partnership s investment in Local Limited
Partnership interests and the Partnership s allocable share
of mortgage loans on and other debts related to the Housing
Complexes owned by such Local Limited Partnerships. Asset
management fees of $36,874 and $42,843 were incurred during the six
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No payments
of those fees were made during either of the six months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

(b) 

  A subordinated
disposition fee in an amount equal to 1% of the sale price of real
estate sold by the Local Limited Partnerships. Payment of this fee
is subordinated to the Limited Partners receiving distributions
equal to their capital contributions and their return on investment
(as defined in the Partnership Agreement) and is payable only if
services are rendered in the sales effort. No such fee was incurred
for all periods presented. 

(c) 

  The Partnership
reimburses the General Partner or its affiliates for operating
expenses incurred on behalf of the Partnership. Operating expense
reimbursements paid were $10,000 and $53,624 during the six months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The
accrued fees and expenses due to General Partner and affiliates
consisted of the following at: 

The
General Partner and/or its affiliates do not anticipate that these
accrued fees will be paid in full until such time as capital
reserves are in excess of future foreseeable working capital
requirements of the Partnership.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations 

Forward Looking Statements 

With
the exception of the discussion regarding historical information,
this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  and other discussions
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q contain forward looking statements.
Such statements are based on current expectations subject to
uncertainties and other factors which may involve known and unknown
risks that could cause actual results of operations to differ
materially from those projected or implied. Further, certain
forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions about future
events which may not prove to be accurate. 

Risks
and uncertainties inherent in forward looking statements include,
but are not limited to, our future cash flows and ability to obtain
sufficient financing, level of operating expenses, conditions in
the Low Income Housing Tax Credit property market and the economy
in general, as well as legal proceedings. Historical results are
not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future
period. 

Subsequent
written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the
Partnership or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by cautionary statements in this Form 10-Q and in
other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

The
following discussion and analysis compares the results of
operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, and should be read in conjunction with the condensed
financial statements and accompanying notes included within this
report. 

Financial Condition 

The
Partnership s assets at September 30, 2016 consisted of
$38,000 in cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities at September 30,
2016 consisted of $1,052,000 of accrued fees and expenses due to
General Partner and affiliates. 

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months
Ended September 30, 2015  The Partnership's net loss for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was $33,000, reflecting a
decrease of $60,000 from the net income of $27,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The change was partially due to a
$58,000 decrease in gain on sale during the three months ended
September 30, 2016. The gain on sale of Local Limited Partnerships
will vary from period to period depending on the value and sales
price of the Housing Complexes that have been identified for
disposition and the closing date of such transaction. Asset
management fees decreased by $2,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016. These fees are calculated based on the value of
the invested assets, which decreased due to the sale of Local
Limited Partnerships. There was a $2,000 decrease in legal and
accounting fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due
to the timing of the accounting work performed. Reporting fees
decreased by $6,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
due to the fact that Local Limited Partnerships pay the reporting
fees to the Partnership when the Local Limited Partnerships 
cash flows will allow for the payment. 

Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended
September 30, 2015  The Partnership's net loss for the six
months ended September 30, 2016 was $59,000, reflecting a decrease
of approximately $94,000 from the net loss of $153,000 for the six
months ended September 30, 2015. The change was primarily due to
the $125,000 decrease in impairment loss for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended September 30,
2015. In addition, the Partnership experienced a $23,000 decrease
in equity in losses of Local Limited Partnerships for the six
months ended September 30, 2016. The investment balances reached
zero in the prior year, therefore no further impairment or equity
in losses could be recorded. There was a $58,000 decrease in gain
on sale during the six months ended September 30, 2016. The gain on
sale of Local Limited Partnerships will vary from period to period
depending on the value and sales price of the Housing Complexes
that have been identified for disposition and the closing date of
such transaction. Asset management fees decreased by $6,000 for the
six months ended September 30, 2016. These fees are calculated
based on the value of the invested assets, which decreased due to
the sale of Local Limited Partnerships. There was a $5,000 decrease
in legal and accounting fees for the six months ended September 30,
2016 due to the timing of the accounting work performed. Write-off
of other expenses increased by $3,000 during the six months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to six months ended September 30, 2015.
Capitalized   costs from
potential disposition of Local Limited Partnerships were expensed
due to the length of time it has taken to dispose of 
 the
properties. Reporting fees decreased by $6,000 for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended September
30, 2015 due to the fact that Local Limited Partnerships pay the
reporting fees to the Partnership when the Local Limited
Partnerships  cash flows will allow for the
payment.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations (continued)  

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended
September 30, 2015  Net cash used during the six months ended
September 30, 2016 was $4,000, compared to net cash provided during
the six months ended September 30, 2015 of $23,000. During the six
months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership received $58,000
in net proceeds from the disposition of Local Limited Partnerships
compared to no proceeds received during the six months ended
September 30, 2016. The net proceeds received from the sale of
Local Limited Partnerships will vary from period to period
depending on the values and sale prices of the Housing Complexes
that have been disposed and the closing dates of such transactions.
The Partnership reimbursed the General Partner or its affiliates
$10,000 for expenses paid on its behalf during the six months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $54,000 reimbursed during the six
months ended September 30, 2015. Reimbursement of operating
expenses are paid after management reviews the cash position of the
Partnership. Reporting fees decreased by $6,000 for the six months
ended September 30, 2016. The Local Limited Partnerships pay
reporting fees and distributions to the Partnership when the Local
Limited Partnerships  cash flows will allow for the
payment. 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, accrued payables, which
consist primarily of asset management fees to the General Partner
or its affiliates, increased by $52,000, compared to the six months
ended September 30, 2015. The General Partner does not anticipate
that these accrued fees will be paid in full until such time as
capital reserves are in excess of future foreseeable working
capital requirements of the Partnership. 

The
Partnership expects its future cash flows, together with its net
available assets as of September 30, 2016, to be insufficient to
meet all currently foreseeable future cash requirements. Associates
has agreed to continue providing advances sufficient enough to fund
the operations and working capital requirements of the Partnership
through November 30, 2017.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a)             

Disclosure controls and procedures 

As of
the end of the periods covered by this report, the
Partnership s General Partner, under the supervision and with
the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of Associates, carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Partnership s  disclosure controls
and procedures  as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based on that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that,
as of the end of the period covered by this report, the
Partnership s disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective to ensure that material information required to be
disclosed in the Partnership s periodic report filings with
SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
period specified by the SEC s rules and forms, consistent
with the definition of  disclosure controls and
procedures  under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. 

The
Partnership must rely on the Local Limited Partnerships to provide
the Partnership with certain information necessary to the timely
filing of the Partnership s periodic reports. Factors in the
accounting at the Local Limited Partnerships have caused delays in
the provision of such information during past reporting periods,
and resulted in the Partnership s inability to file its
periodic reports in a timely manner. 

Once
the Partnership has received the necessary information from the
Local Limited Partnerships, the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer of Associates believe that the material
information required to be disclosed in the Partnership s
periodic report filings with SEC is effectively recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, albeit not in a timely manner.
Going forward, the Partnership will use the means reasonably within
its power to impose procedures designed to obtain from the Local
Limited Partnerships the information necessary to the timely filing
of the Partnership s periodic reports. 

(b)             

Changes in internal controls 

There
were no changes in the Partnership s internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Partnership s internal
control over financial reporting.
