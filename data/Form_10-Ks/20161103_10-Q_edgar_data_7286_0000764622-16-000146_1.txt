FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This document contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations.  These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as "estimate," "predict," "may," "believe," "plan," "expect," "require," "intend," "assume" and similar words.  Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements.  A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS.  In addition to the Risk Factors described in Part I, Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 ("2015 Form 10-K"), Part II, Item 1A of this report and in Part I, Item 2   "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this report, these factors include, but are not limited to: 

our ability to manage capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs while maintaining reliability and customer service levels; 
                
    variations in demand for electricity, including those due to weather, seasonality, the general economy, customer and sales growth (or decline), and the effects of energy conservation measures and distributed generation; 
                
    power plant and transmission system performance and outages; 
                
    competition in retail and wholesale power markets; 
                
    regulatory and judicial decisions, developments and proceedings; 
                
    new legislation, ballot initiatives and regulation, including those relating to environmental requirements, regulatory policy, nuclear plant operations and potential deregulation of retail electric markets; 
                
    fuel and water supply availability; 
                
    our ability to achieve timely and adequate rate recovery of our costs, including returns on and of debt and equity capital investment; 
                
    our ability to meet renewable energy and energy efficiency mandates and recover related costs; 
                
    risks inherent in the operation of nuclear facilities, including spent fuel disposal uncertainty; 
                
    current and future economic conditions in Arizona, including in real estate markets; 
                
    the development of new technologies which may affect electric sales or delivery; 
                
    the cost of debt and equity capital and the ability to access capital markets when required; 
                
    environmental and other concerns surrounding coal-fired generation, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions; 
                
    volatile fuel and purchased power costs; 
                
    the investment performance of the assets of our nuclear decommissioning trust, pension, and other postretirement benefit plans and the resulting impact on future funding requirements; 
                
    the liquidity of wholesale power markets and the use of derivative contracts in our business; 
                
    potential shortfalls in insurance coverage; 
                
    new accounting requirements or new interpretations of existing requirements; 
                
    generation, transmission and distribution facility and system conditions and operating costs; 
                
    the ability to meet the anticipated future need for additional generation and associated transmission facilities in our region; 
                
    the willingness or ability of our counterparties, power plant participants and power plant land owners to meet contractual or other obligations or extend the rights for continued power plant operations; and 
                
    restrictions on dividends or other provisions in our credit agreements and Arizona Corporation Commission ("ACC") orders. 
       
  These and other factors are discussed in the Risk Factors described in Part I, Item 1A of our 2015 Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of this report, which readers should review carefully before placing any reliance on our financial statements or disclosures.

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1  .  
    Consolidation and Nature of Operations    
       
  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries:  APS, 4C Acquisition, LLC ("4CA"), Bright Canyon Energy Corporation ("BCE") and El Dorado Investment Company ("El Dorado").  Intercompany accounts and transactions between the consolidated companies have been eliminated.  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for APS include the accounts of APS and the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station ("Palo Verde") sale leaseback variable interest entities ("VIEs") (see Note   5   for further discussion).  Our accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Amounts reported in our interim Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income are not necessarily indicative of amounts expected for the respective annual periods, due to the effects of seasonal temperature variations on energy consumption, timing of maintenance on electric generating units, and other factors. 
    
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise disclosed in the notes) that we believe are necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such regulations, although we believe that the disclosures provided are adequate to make the interim information presented not misleading.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and these notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our 2015 Form 10-K.     
    
  Supplemental Cash Flow Information

    Long-Term Debt and Liquidity Matters 
       
  Pinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide credit support for their commercial paper programs, to refinance indebtedness, and for other general corporate purposes. 

16 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Pinnacle West 
    
  On May 13, 2016, Pinnacle West replaced its   $200 million   revolving credit facility that would have matured in May 2019, with a new   $200 million   facility that matures in May 2021. Pinnacle West has the option to increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum of   $300 million   upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders. At   September 30, 2016  , Pinnacle West had   no   outstanding borrowings under its credit facility,   no   letters of credit outstanding and   no   commercial paper borrowings. 
    
  On August 31, 2016, PNW entered into a   $75 million     364  -day unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in August 2017. PNW will use the new facility to fund or otherwise support obligations related to 4CA, and borrowings under the facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus   0.80%   per annum. At September 30, 2016, Pinnacle West had   $34 million   outstanding under the facility. 
    
  APS 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, APS increased its commercial paper program from   $250 million   to   $500 million  . 
    
  On April 22, 2016, APS entered into a   $100 million   term loan facility that matures April 22, 2019. Interest rates are based on APS's senior unsecured debt credit ratings. APS used the proceeds to repay and refinance existing short-term indebtedness. 
    
  On May 6, 2016, APS issued   $350 million   of   3.75%   unsecured senior notes that mature on May 15, 2046. The net proceeds from the sale were used to redeem and cancel pollution control bonds (see details below), and to repay commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. 
    
  On May 13, 2016, APS replaced its   $500 million   revolving credit facility that would have matured in May 2019, with a new   $500 million   facility that matures in May 2021. 
    
  On June 1, 2016, APS redeemed at par and canceled all   $64 million   of the Navajo County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation Revenue Refunding Bonds (Arizona Public Service Company Cholla Project), 2009 Series D and E.

  On September 20, 2016, APS issued   $250 million   of   2.55%   unsecured senior notes that mature on September 15, 2026. The net proceeds from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used in connection with the payment at maturity of our   $250 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.25%   Notes due August 1, 2016. 
    
  On September 20, 2016, APS redeemed at par and canceled all   $27 million   of the Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation Revenue Refunding Bonds (Arizona Public Service Company Navajo Project), 2009 Series B. 
  
   17 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

At   September 30, 2016  , APS had   two   revolving credit facilities totaling   $1 billion  , including a   $500 million   credit facility that matures in September 2020 and the   $500 million   facility that matures in May 2021.  APS may increase the amount of each facility up to a maximum of   $700 million  , for a total of   $1.4 billion  , upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders.  Interest rates are based on APS s senior unsecured debt credit ratings.  These facilities are available to support APS s   $500 million   commercial paper program, for bank borrowings or for issuances of letters of credit.  At   September 30, 2016  , APS had   $83 million   of commercial paper outstanding and   no   outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under its revolving credit facilities. 
    
  See "Financial Assurances" in Note   7   for a discussion of APS s separate outstanding letters of credit. 
    
  Debt Fair Value 
    
  Our long-term debt fair value estimates are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Certain of our debt instruments contain third-party credit enhancements and, in accordance with GAAP, we do not consider the effect of these credit enhancements when determining fair value.  The following table presents the estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including current maturities (dollars in thousands): 

Debt Provisions 
    
  An existing ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least   40%  .  As defined in the ACC order, the common equity ratio is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt.  At   September 30, 2016  , APS was in compliance with this common equity ratio requirement.  Its total shareholder equity was approximately   $4.9 billion  , and total capitalization was approximately   $9.2 billion  .  APS would be prohibited from paying dividends if the payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately   $3.7 billion  , assuming APS s total capitalization remains the same. 

3  . 
    Regulatory Matters    
       
  Retail Rate Case Filing with the Arizona Corporation Commission 
    
  On June 1, 2016, APS filed an application with the ACC for an annual increase in retail base rates of   $165.9 million  .  This amount excludes amounts that are currently collected on customer bills through adjustor mechanisms.  The application requests that some of the balances in these adjustor accounts (aggregating to approximately   $267.6 million   as of December 31, 2015) be transferred into base rates through the ratemaking process.  This transfer would not have an incremental effect on average customer bills.  The average annual customer bill impact of APS s request is an increase of   5.74%   (the average annual bill impact for a typical APS residential customer is   7.96%  )  .   
  
   18 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The principal provisions of the application are: 

an original cost rate base of   $6.8 billion  , which approximates the ACC-jurisdictional portion of the book value of utility assets, net of accumulated depreciation and other credits, as of December 31, 2015; 

the following proposed capital structure and costs of capital: 

a   1%   return on the increment of fair value rate base above APS s original cost rate base, as provided for by Arizona law;  

authorization to defer for potential future recovery its share of the construction costs associated with installing selective catalytic reduction equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant (estimated at approximately   $400 million   in direct costs).  APS proposes that the rates established in this rate case be increased through a step mechanism beginning in 2019 to reflect these deferred costs;  

authorization to defer for potential future recovery in the Company s next general rate case the construction costs APS incurs for its Ocotillo power plant modernization project, once the project reaches commercial operation.  APS estimates the direct construction costs at approximately   $500 million   and that the new facility will be fully in service by early 2019;  

authorization to defer until the Company s next general rate case the increase or decrease in its Arizona property taxes attributable to tax rate changes after the date the rate application is adjudicated; 

updates and modifications to four of APS s adjustor mechanisms - the Power Supply Adjustor ( PSA ), the Lost Fixed Cost Recovery Mechanism ( LFCR ), the Transmission Cost Adjustor ( TCA ) and the Environmental Improvement Surcharge ( EIS  

a number of proposed rate design changes for residential customers, including: 
                
    change the on-peak time of use period from 12 p.m. - 7 p.m. to 3 p.m. - 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding holidays; 
                
    reduce the difference in the on- and off-peak energy price and lower all energy charges; 
                
    offer four rate plan options, three of which have demand charges and a fourth that is available to non-partial requirements customers using less than   600   kWh on average per month; and 
     
   19 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

modify the current net metering tariff to provide for a credit at the retail rate for the portion of generation by rooftop solar customers that offsets their own load, and for a credit for excess energy delivered to the grid at an export rate.   

proposed rate design changes for commercial customers, including an aggregation rider that allows certain large customers to qualify for a reduced rate, an extra-high load factor rate schedule for certain customers, and an economic development rate offering for new loads meeting certain criteria.  
       
  The Company requested that the increase become effective July 1, 2017.  On July 22, 2016, the administrative law judge set a procedural schedule for the rate proceedings. The ACC staff and interveners will begin filing their direct testimony on December 21, 2016, and the hearing will commence on March 22, 2017. The Commission staff supports completing the case within   12   months.  APS cannot predict the outcome of its request.  
    
  Prior Rate Case Filing 
    
  On June 1, 2011, APS filed an application with the ACC for a net retail base rate increase of   $95.5 million  .  APS requested that the increase become effective July 1, 2012.  The request would have increased the average retail customer bill by approximately   6.6%  .  On January 6, 2012, APS and other parties to the general retail rate case entered into an agreement (the "2012 Settlement Agreement") detailing the terms upon which the parties agreed to settle the rate case.  On May 15, 2012, the ACC approved the 2012 Settlement Agreement without material modifications. 
    
  Settlement Agreement 
    
  The 2012 Settlement Agreement provides for a   zero   net change in base rates, consisting of:  (1) a non-fuel base rate increase of   $116.3 million  ; (2) a fuel-related base rate decrease of   $153.1 million   (to be implemented by a change in the base fuel rate for fuel and purchased power costs ("Base Fuel Rate") from   $0.03757   to   $0.03207   per kWh; and (3) the transfer of cost recovery for certain renewable energy projects from the Arizona Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff ("RES") surcharge to base rates in an estimated amount of   $36.8 million  . 
     
  Other key provisions of the 2012 Settlement Agreement include the following: 

An authorized return on common equity of   10.0%  ; 

Deferral for future recovery or refund of property taxes above or below a specified 2010 test year level caused by changes to the Arizona property tax rate as follows: 

Deferral of   100%   in all years if Arizona property tax rates decrease;

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

A procedure to allow APS to request rate adjustments prior to its next general rate case related to APS s acquisition of additional interests in Units 4 and 5 and the related closure of Units 1-3 of the Four Corners Power Plant ("Four Corners") (APS made its filing under this provision on December 30, 2013, see "Four Corners" below);  

Implementation of an LFCR rate mechanism to support energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation; 

Modifications to the EIS to allow for the recovery of carrying costs for capital expenditures associated with government-mandated environmental controls, subject to an existing cents per kWh cap on cost recovery that could produce up to approximately   $5 million   in revenues annually; 

Modifications to the Power Supply Adjustor ("PSA"), including the elimination of the   9  0/10 sharing provision; 

A limitation on the use of the RES surcharge and the Demand Side Management Adjustor Charge ("DSMAC") to recoup capital expenditures not required under the terms of APS s 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement (the "2009 Settlement Agreement"); 

Modification of the Transmission Cost Adjustor ("TCA") to streamline the process for future transmission-related rate changes; and 

Implementation of various changes to rate schedules, including the adoption of an experimental "buy-through" rate that could allow certain large commercial and industrial customers to select alternative sources of generation to be supplied by APS. 
       
  The 2012 Settlement Agreement was approved by the ACC on May 15, 2012, with new rates effective on July 1, 2012.  This accomplished a goal set by the parties to the 2009 Settlement Agreement to process subsequent rate cases within   twelve months   of sufficiency findings from the ACC staff, which generally occurs within   30 days   after the filing of a rate case. 
    
  Cost Recovery Mechanisms 
    
  APS has received regulatory decisions that allow for more timely recovery of certain costs through the following recovery mechanisms. 
    
  Renewable Energy Standard  .    In 2006, the ACC approved the RES.  Under the RES, electric utilities that are regulated by the ACC must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources, including solar, wind, biomass, biogas and geothermal technologies.  In order to achieve these requirements, the ACC allows APS to include a RES surcharge as part of customer bills to recover the approved amounts for use on renewable energy projects.  Each year APS is required to file a   five  -year implementation plan with the ACC and seek approval for funding the upcoming year s RES budget. 
     
    In December of 2014, the ACC voted that it had no objection to APS implementing an APS-owned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid.  The first stage of the program, called the "Solar Partner Program," placed   8   MW of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits, as well as make systems available to limited-income customers who  
  
   21 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

cannot easily install solar through transactions with third parties. The second stage of the program, which includes an additional   2   MW of rooftop solar and energy storage, will place   two   energy storage systems sized at   2   MW on   two   different high solar penetration feeders to test various grid-related operation improvements and system interoperability, and is planned to be in operation by the end of 2016.  The ACC expressly reserved that any determination of prudency of the residential rooftop solar program for rate making purposes shall not be made until the project is fully in service and APS requests cost recovery in a future rate case.  
    
  On July 1, 2015, APS filed its 2016 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a RES budget of approximately   $148 million  .  On January 12, 2016, the ACC approved APS s plan and requested budget.   
    
  On July 1, 2016, APS filed its 2017 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately   $150 million  .  APS s budget request included additional funding to process the high volume of residential rooftop solar interconnection requests and also requested a permanent waiver of the residential distributed energy requirement for 2017 contained in the RES rules. 
    
    In September of 2016, the ACC initiated a proceeding which will examine the possible modernization and expansion of the RES.  The ACC noted that many of the provisions of the original rule may no longer be appropriate, and the underlying economic assumptions associated with the rule have changed dramatically.  The proceeding will review such issues as the rapidly declining cost of solar generation, an increased interest in community solar projects, energy storage options, and the decline in fossil fuel generation due to stringent regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA").  The proceeding will also examine the feasibility of increasing the standard to   30%   of retail sales by 2030, in contrast to the current standard of   15%   of retail sales by 2025.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. 
    
  Demand Side Management Adjustor Charge  .    The ACC Electric Energy Efficiency Standards require APS to submit a Demand Side Management Implementation Plan ("DSM Plan") for review by and approval of the ACC.  In March 2014, the ACC approved a Resource Savings Initiative that allows APS to count towards compliance with the ACC Electric Energy Efficiency Standards, savings from improvements to APS s transmission and delivery system, generation and facilities that have been approved through a DSM Plan.     
    
  On March 20, 2015, APS filed an application with the ACC requesting a budget of   $68.9 million   for 2015 and minor modifications to its DSM portfolio going forward, including for the first time   three   resource savings projects which reflect energy savings on APS's system.  The ACC approved APS s 2015 DSM budget on November 25, 2015.  In its decision, the ACC also approved that verified energy savings from APS's resource savings projects could be counted toward compliance with the Electric Energy Efficiency Standard, however, the ACC ruled that APS was not allowed to count savings from systems savings projects toward determination of its achievement tier level for its performance incentive, nor may APS include savings from conservation voltage reduction in the calculation of its LFCR mechanism. 
    
  On June 1, 2015, APS filed its 2016 DSM Plan requesting a budget of   $68.9 million   and minor modifications to its DSM portfolio to increase energy savings and cost effectiveness of the programs.  On April 1, 2016, APS filed an amended 2016 DSM Plan that sought minor modifications to its existing DSM Plan and requested to continue the current DSMAC and current budget of   $68.9 million  .  On July 12, 2016, the ACC approved APS s amended DSM Plan and directed APS to spend up to an additional   $4 million   on a new residential demand response or load management program that facilitates energy storage technology. 
    
  Electric Energy Efficiency.    On June 27, 2013, the ACC voted to open a new docket investigating whether the Electric Energy Efficiency Standards should be modified.  The ACC held a series of   three   workshops in March and April 2014 to investigate methodologies used to determine cost effective energy  
  
   22 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

efficiency programs, cost recovery mechanisms, incentives, and potential changes to the Electric Energy Efficiency and Resource Planning Rules.   
    
  On November 4, 2014, the ACC staff issued a request for informal comment on a draft of possible amendments to Arizona s Electric Energy Efficiency Standards.  The draft proposed substantial changes to the rules and energy efficiency standards.  The ACC accepted written comments and took public comment regarding the possible amendments on December 19, 2014.  A formal rulemaking has not been initiated and there has been no additional action on the draft to date.  On July 12, 2016, the ACC ordered that ACC staff convene a workshop within   120   days to discuss a number of issues related to the Electric Energy Efficiency Standards, including the process of determining the cost effectiveness of DSM programs and the treatment of peak demand and capacity reductions, among others. 
     
  PSA Mechanism and Balance.    The PSA provides for the adjustment of retail rates to reflect variations in retail fuel and purchased power costs.  The following table shows the changes in the deferred fuel and purchased power regulatory asset (liability) for 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands): 

The PSA rate for the PSA year beginning February 1, 2016 is   $0.001678   per kWh, as compared to   $0.000887   per kWh for the prior year.  This new rate is comprised of a forward component of   $0.001975   per kWh and a historical component of   $(0.000297)   per kWh.  On October 15, 2015, APS notified the ACC that it was initiating a PSA transition component of   $(0.004936)   per kWh for the months of November 2015, December 2015, and January 2016.  The PSA transition component is a mid-year adjustment to the PSA rate that may be established when conditions change sufficiently to cause high balances to accrue in the PSA balancing account.  The transition component expired on February 1, 2016.  Any uncollected (overcollected) deferrals during the PSA year, after accounting for the transition component, will be included in the calculation of the PSA rate for the PSA year beginning February 1, 2017.   
    
  Transmission Rates, Transmission Cost Adjustor and Other Transmission Matters  .    In July 2008, the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") approved an Open Access Transmission Tariff for APS to move from fixed rates to a formula rate-setting methodology in order to more accurately reflect and recover the costs that APS incurs in providing transmission services.  A large portion of the rate represents charges for transmission services to serve APS's retail customers ("Retail Transmission Charges").  In order to recover the Retail Transmission Charges, APS was previously required to file an application with, and obtain approval from, the ACC to reflect changes in Retail Transmission Charges through the TCA.  Under the terms of the 2012 Settlement Agreement, however, an adjustment to rates to recover the Retail Transmission Charges will be made annually each June 1 and will go into effect automatically unless suspended by the ACC. 
    
  The formula rate is updated each year effective June 1 on the basis of APS's actual cost of service, as disclosed in APS's FERC Form 1 report for the previous fiscal year.  Items to be updated include actual capital  
  
   23 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

expenditures made as compared with previous projections, transmission revenue credits and other items.  The resolution of proposed adjustments can result in significant volatility in the revenues to be collected.  APS reviews the proposed formula rate filing amounts with the ACC staff.  Any items or adjustments which are not agreed to by APS and the ACC staff can remain in dispute until settled or litigated at FERC.  Settlement or litigated resolution of disputed issues could require an extended period of time and could have a significant effect on the Retail Transmission Charges because any adjustment, though applied prospectively, may be calculated to account for previously over- or under-collected amounts. 
    
  Effective June 1, 2015, APS s annual wholesale transmission rates for all users of its transmission system decreased by approximately   $17.6 million   for the twelve-month period beginning June 1, 2015 in accordance with the FERC-approved formula.  An adjustment to APS s retail rates to recover FERC-approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2015. 
    
  Effective June 1, 2016, APS's annual wholesale transmission rates for all users of its transmission system increased by approximately   $24.9 million   in accordance with the FERC-approved formula.  An adjustment to APS s retail rates to recover FERC approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2016. 
    
  APS's formula rate protocols have been in effect since 2008. Recent FERC orders suggest that FERC is examining the structure of formula rate protocols and may require companies such as APS to make changes to their protocols in the future. 
    
  Lost Fixed Cost Recovery Mechanism  .    The LFCR mechanism permits APS to recover on an after-the-fact basis a portion of its fixed costs that would otherwise have been collected by APS in the kWh sales lost due to APS energy efficiency programs and to distributed generation such as rooftop solar arrays.  The fixed costs recoverable by the LFCR mechanism were established in the 2012 Settlement Agreement and amount to approximately   3.1 cents   per residential kWh lost and   2.3 cents   per non-residential kWh lost.  The LFCR adjustment has a year-over-year cap of   1%   of retail revenues.  Any amounts left unrecovered in a particular year because of this cap can be carried over for recovery in a future year.  The kWh s lost from energy efficiency are based on a third-party evaluation of APS s energy efficiency programs.  Distributed generation sales losses are determined from the metered output from the distributed generation units. 
    
  APS files for a LFCR adjustment every January.  APS filed its 2014 annual LFCR adjustment on January 15, 2014, requesting a LFCR adjustment of   $25.3 million  , effective March 1, 2014.  The ACC approved APS s LFCR adjustment without change on March 11, 2014, which became effective April 1, 2014.  APS filed its 2015 annual LFCR adjustment on January 15, 2015, requesting an LFCR adjustment of   $38.5 million  , which was approved on March 2, 2015, effective for the first billing cycle of March.  APS filed its 2016 annual LFCR adjustment on January 15, 2016, requesting an LFCR adjustment of    $46.4 million   (a   $7.9 million   annual increase), to be effective for the first billing cycle of March 2016.    The ACC approved the 2016 annual LFCR to be effective in May 2016.  Because the LFCR mechanism has a balancing account that trues up any under or over recoveries, the two months delay in implementation did not have an adverse effect on APS. 
    
  Net Metering 
    
  On July 12, 2013, APS filed an application with the ACC proposing a solution to address the cost shift brought by the current net metering rules.  On December 3, 2013, the ACC issued its order on APS's net metering proposal.  The ACC instituted a charge on customers who install rooftop solar panels after December 31, 2013.  The charge of   $0.70   per kilowatt became effective on January 1, 2014, and is estimated to  
  
   24 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

collect   $4.90   per month from a typical future rooftop solar customer to help pay for their use of the electric grid.  The fixed charge does not increase APS's revenue because it is credited to the LFCR. 
    
  In making its decision, the ACC determined that the current net metering program creates a cost shift, causing non-solar utility customers to pay higher rates to cover the costs of maintaining the electric grid.  The ACC acknowledged that the   $0.70   per kilowatt charge addresses only a portion of the cost shift.   
    
  On October 20, 2015, the ACC voted to conduct a generic evidentiary hearing on the value and cost of distributed generation to gather information that will inform the ACC on net metering issues and cost of service studies in upcoming utility rate cases.  A hearing was held in April 2016.   On October 7, 2016, an Administrative Law Judge (the "ALJ") issued a recommendation in the docket concerning the value and cost of distributed generation. The ALJ recommended a change to how customers are compensated for energy that they export from rooftop solar systems. Instead of retail rate net metering, the ALJ recommended that the amount of compensation be established by using both an avoided cost calculation and a grid-scale solar resource proxy calculation that would be updated in subsequent utility rate cases. The ALJ recommended that the change to how APS pays for exported rooftop solar energy apply only to those customers who apply to interconnect their distributed generation systems after a decision in APS s currently pending rate case. The ALJ found rooftop solar customers to be partial requirements customers, but recommended that whether rooftop solar customers should be placed into a separate customer class for purposes of ratemaking be decided in individual utility rate cases. Exceptions to the ALJ recommendation are due November 15, 2016.  On December 13, 2016, the ACC will discuss at an open meeting the ALJ recommendation concerning the value and cost of distributed generation.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.  
    
  In 2015, Arizona jurisdictional utilities UNS Electric, Inc. and Tucson Electric Power Company ("TEP") both filed applications with the ACC requesting rate increases. These applications include rate design changes to mitigate the cost shift caused by net metering. On December 9, 2015 and February 23, 2016, APS filed testimony in the UNS Electric, Inc. rate case in  support of the UNS Electric, Inc. proposed rate design changes. APS actively participated in the related hearings held in March 2016. On August 18, 2016, the ACC issued a decision which ordered that net metering be considered in a separate, phase 2 of the UNS Electric, Inc. rate case to occur after the ACC decides issues raised in the separate, generic docket concerning the value and cost of distributed generation discussed above. APS has also intervened in the upcoming TEP rate case. On June 24, 2016, APS filed testimony in the TEP rate case in support of the TEP proposed rate design changes. In August 2016, the ACC also bifurcated the TEP rate case into   two   phases, the first of which will address revenue requirements and other traditional rate case issues while the second will address net metering issues. The outcomes of these proceedings will not directly impact our financial position. 
    
  Appellate Review of Third-Party Regulatory Decision ("System Improvement Benefits" or "SIB") 
    
  In a recent appellate challenge to an ACC rate decision involving a water company, the Arizona Court of Appeals considered the question of how the ACC should determine the  fair value  of a utility s property, as specified in the Arizona Constitution, in connection with authorizing the recovery of costs through rate adjustors outside of a rate case.  The Court of Appeals reversed the ACC s method of finding fair value in that case, and raised questions concerning the relationship between the need for fair value findings and the recovery of capital and certain other utility costs through adjustors. The ACC sought review by the Arizona Supreme Court of this decision, and APS filed a brief supporting the ACC s petition to the Arizona Supreme Court for review of the Court of Appeals  decision.  On February 9, 2016, the Arizona Supreme Court granted review of the decision and on August 8, 2016, the Arizona Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals opinion and affirmed the ACC s orders approving the water company s SIB adjustor.

System Benefits Charge 
    
  The 2012 Settlement Agreement  provides that once APS achieved full funding of its decommissioning obligation under the sale leaseback agreements covering Unit 2 of Palo Verde, APS was required to implement a reduced System Benefits charge effective January 1, 2016.  Beginning on January 1, 2016, APS began implementing a reduced System Benefits charge.  The impact on APS retail revenues from the new System Benefits charge is an overall reduction of approximately   $14.6 million   per year with a corresponding reduction in depreciation and amortization expense.   
    
  Subpoena from Arizona Corporation Commissioner Robert Burns 
    
  On August 25, 2016, Commissioner Burns, individually and not by action of the ACC as a whole, filed subpoenas in APS s current retail rate proceeding to APS and Pinnacle West for the production of records and information relating to a range of expenditures from 2011 through year-to-date 2016. The subpoenas request information concerning marketing and advertising expenditures, charitable donations, lobbying expenses, contributions to 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) nonprofits and political contributions.  The return date for the production of information was set as September 15, 2016. The subpoenas also sought testimony from company personnel having knowledge of the material, including the Chief Executive Officer, on October 6, 2016.  
    
  On September 9, 2016, APS filed with the ACC a motion to quash the subpoenas, or alternatively stay APS  obligations to comply with the subpoenas and decline to decide APS  motion pending court proceedings. Contemporaneously with the filing of this motion, APS and Pinnacle West filed a complaint for special action and declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of Arizona for Maricopa County, seeking a declaratory judgment that Commissioner Burns  subpoenas are contrary to law.  On September 15, 2016, APS produced all non-confidential and responsive documents and offered to produce any remaining responsive documents that are confidential after an appropriate confidentiality agreement is signed. APS and Pinnacle West cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
    
  Four Corners 
    
  On December 30, 2013, APS purchased Southern California Edison Company's ("SCE s")   48%   ownership interest in each of Units 4 and 5 of Four Corners.  The 2012 Settlement Agreement includes a procedure to allow APS to request rate adjustments prior to its next general rate case related to APS s acquisition of the additional interests in Units 4 and 5 and the related closure of Units 1-3 of Four Corners.  APS made its filing under this provision on December 30, 2013.  On December 23, 2014, the ACC approved rate adjustments resulting in a revenue increase of   $57.1 million   on an annual basis.  This includes the deferral for future recovery of all non-fuel operating costs for the acquired SCE interest in Four Corners, net of the non-fuel operating costs savings resulting from the closure of Units 1-3 from the date of closing of the purchase through its inclusion in rates.  The 2012 Settlement Agreement also provides for deferral for future recovery of all unrecovered costs incurred in connection with the closure of Units 1-3.  The deferral balance related to the acquisition of SCE s interest in Units 4 and 5 and the closure of Units 1-3 was   $65 million   as of September 30, 2016 and is being amortized in rates over a total of   10   years.  On February 23, 2015, the Arizona School Boards Association and the Association of Business Officials filed a notice of appeal in Division 1 of the Arizona Court of Appeals of the ACC decision approving the rate adjustments.  APS has intervened and is actively participating in the proceeding.  The Arizona Court of Appeals suspended the appeal pending the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in the SIB matter discussed above.  On August 8, 2016, the Arizona Supreme Court issued its opinion in the SIB matter, and the Arizona Court of Appeals has now ordered supplemental briefing on how that SIB decision should affect the challenge to the Four Corners rate adjustment.  We cannot predict when or how this matter will be resolved. 
  
   26 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

As part of APS s acquisition of SCE s interest in Units 4 and 5, APS and SCE agreed, via a "Transmission Termination Agreement" that, upon closing of the acquisition, the companies would terminate an existing transmission agreement ("Transmission Agreement") between the parties that provides transmission capacity on a system (the "Arizona Transmission System") for SCE to transmit its portion of the output from Four Corners to California.  APS previously submitted a request to FERC related to this termination, which resulted in a FERC order denying rate recovery of   $40 million   that APS agreed to pay SCE associated with the termination.  On December 22, 2015, APS and SCE agreed to terminate the Transmission Termination Agreement and allow for the Transmission Agreement to expire according to its terms, which includes settling obligations in accordance with the terms of the Transmission Agreement.  APS established a regulatory asset of   $12 million    in 2015 in connection with the payment required under the terms of the Transmission Agreement.  On July 1, 2016, FERC issued an order denying APS s request to recover the regulatory asset through its FERC-jurisdictional rates.  APS and SCE completed the termination of the Transmission Agreement on July 6, 2016.  APS made the required payment to SCE and wrote-off the   $12 million   regulatory asset and charged operating revenues to reflect this order in the second quarter of 2016.  On July 29, 2016, APS filed a request for rehearing with FERC.  In its order denying recovery FERC also referred to its enforcement division a question of whether the agreement between APS and SCE relating to the settlement of obligations under the Transmission Agreement was a jurisdictional contract that should have been filed with FERC.  APS cannot predict the outcome of either matter. 
    
  Cholla 
    
  On September 11, 2014, APS announced that it would close Unit 2 of the Cholla Power Plant ("Cholla") and cease burning coal at the other APS-owned units (Units 1 and 3) at the plant by the mid-2020s, if  EPA approves a compromise proposal offered by APS to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules.  On April 14, 2015, the ACC approved APS's plan to retire Unit 2, without expressing any view on the future recoverability of APS's remaining investment in the Unit.  APS closed Unit 2 on October 1, 2015.  Previously, APS estimated Cholla Unit 2 s end of life to be 2033.  APS is currently recovering a return on and of the net book value of the unit in base rates and is seeking recovery of the unit s decommissioning and other retirement-related costs over the remaining life of the plant in its current retail rate case.  APS believes it will be allowed recovery of the remaining net book value of Unit 2 (  $117 million   as of September 30, 2016), in addition to a return on its investment.  In accordance with GAAP, in the third quarter of 2014, Unit 2 s remaining net book value was reclassified from property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset.   If the ACC does not allow full recovery of the remaining net book value of Cholla Unit 2, all or a portion of the regulatory asset will be written off and APS s net income, cash flows, and financial position will be negatively impacted.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities    
  The detail of regulatory assets is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

(a) 
    This asset represents the future recovery of pension benefit obligations through retail rates.  If these costs are disallowed by the ACC, this regulatory asset would be charged to Other Comprehensive Income ("OCI") and result in lower future revenues.  See Note   4   for further discussion. 
              (b) 
    See "Cost Recovery Mechanisms" discussion above. 
              (c) 
    Per the provision of the 2012 Settlement Agreement. 
              (d) 
    There are no regulatory assets for which the ACC has allowed recovery of costs, but not allowed a return by exclusion from rate base.  FERC rates are set using a formula rate as described in "Transmission Rates, Transmission Cost Adjustor and Other Transmission Matters."

    Retirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits    
       
  Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan, a non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan, and an other postretirement benefit plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries.  Pinnacle West uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  The market-related value of our plan assets is their fair value at the measurement dates.  On September 30, 2014, Pinnacle West announced plan design changes to the other postretirement benefit plan. Because of the plan changes, the Company is currently in the process of seeking Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and regulatory approval to move approximately   $140 million   of the other postretirement benefit trust assets into a new trust account to pay for active union employee medical costs. 
    
  Certain pension and other postretirement benefit costs in excess of amounts recovered in electric retail rates were deferred in 2011 and 2012 as a regulatory asset for future recovery, pursuant to APS s 2009 retail rate case settlement.  Pursuant to this order, we began amortizing the regulatory asset over   three years   beginning in July 2012.  We completed amortizing these costs as of June 30, 2015.  We amortized approximately   $2 million   and   $4 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

The following table provides details of the plans  net periodic benefit costs and the portion of these costs charged to expense (including administrative costs and excluding amounts capitalized as overhead construction, billed to electric plant participants or charged or amortized to the regulatory asset) (dollars in thousands): 

Contributions 
    
  We have made voluntary contributions of   $100 million   to our pension plan year-to-date in 2016.  The minimum required contributions for the pension plan are   zero   for the next three years.  We expect to make voluntary contributions up to a total of   $300 million   during the 2016-2018 period.  We expect to make contributions of approximately   $1 million   in each of the next three years to our other postretirement benefit plans.

    Palo Verde Sale Leaseback Variable Interest Entities    
       
  In 1986, APS entered into agreements with   three   separate VIE lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2 and related common facilities. APS will retain the assets through 2023 under   one   lease and 2033 under the other   two   leases.  APS will be required to make payments relating to these leases of approximately   $23 million   annually for the period 2016 through 2023, and   $16 million   annually for the period 2024 through 2033.  At the end of the lease period, APS will have the option to purchase the leased assets at their fair market value, extend the leases for up to   two years  , or return the assets to the lessors. 
    
  The leases' terms give APS the ability to utilize the assets for a significant portion of the assets  economic life, and therefore provide APS with the power to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs  economic performance.  Predominantly due to the lease terms, APS has been deemed the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and therefore consolidates the VIEs. 
    
    As a result of consolidation, we eliminate lease accounting and instead recognize depreciation, resulting in an increase in net income for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $5   million and   $15 million  , respectively, and for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $5   million and

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

$14   million, respectively, entirely attributable to the noncontrolling interests. Income attributable to Pinnacle West shareholders is not impacted by the consolidation.  
    
  Our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   include the following amounts relating to the VIEs (in thousands): 

Assets of the VIEs are restricted and may only be used for payment to the noncontrolling interest holders.  These assets are reported on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  APS is exposed to losses relating to these VIEs upon the occurrence of certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur.  Under certain circumstances (for example, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to make specified payments to the VIEs  noncontrolling equity participants and take title to the leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value.  If such an event were to occur during the lease periods, APS may be required to pay the noncontrolling equity participants approximately   $289 million   beginning in 2016, and up to   $456 million   over the lease terms.  
    
  For regulatory ratemaking purposes, the agreements continue to be treated as operating leases and, as a result, we have recorded a regulatory asset relating to the arrangements. 

6  . 
    Derivative Accounting    
       
  We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas, coal, emissions allowances and in interest rates.  We manage risks associated with market volatility by utilizing various physical and financial derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps.  As part of our overall risk management program, we may use derivative instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels.  Derivative instruments that meet certain hedge accounting criteria may be designated as cash flow hedges and are used to limit our exposure to cash flow variability on forecasted transactions.  The changes in market value of such instruments have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged transactions.  We also enter into derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes.  While we believe the economic hedges mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, these instruments have not been designated as accounting hedges.  Contracts that have the same terms (quantities, delivery points and delivery periods) and for which power does not flow are netted, which reduces both revenues and fuel and purchased power costs in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, but does not impact our financial condition, net income or cash flows. 
    
  Our derivative instruments, excluding those qualifying for a scope exception, are recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability and are measured at fair value.  See Note   10   for a discussion of fair value measurements.  Derivative instruments may qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception if they require physical delivery and the quantities represent those transacted in the normal course of business.  Derivative instruments qualifying for the normal purchases and sales scope exception are accounted for under  
  
   31 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

the accrual method of accounting and excluded from our derivative instrument discussion and disclosures below. 
    
  Hedge effectiveness is the degree to which the derivative instrument contract and the hedged item are correlated and is measured based on the relative changes in fair value of the derivative instrument contract and the hedged item over time.  We assess hedge effectiveness both at inception and on a continuing basis.  These assessments exclude the time value of certain options.  For accounting hedges that are deemed an effective hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  We recognize in current earnings, subject to the PSA, the gains and losses representing hedge ineffectiveness, and the gains and losses on any hedge components which are excluded from our effectiveness assessment.  As cash flow hedge accounting has been discontinued for the significant majority of our contracts, after May 31, 2012, effectiveness testing is no longer being performed for these contracts. 
    
  For its regulated operations, APS defers for future rate treatment   100%   of the unrealized gains and losses on derivatives pursuant to the PSA mechanism that would otherwise be recognized in income.  Realized gains and losses on derivatives are deferred in accordance with the PSA to the extent the amounts are above or below the Base Fuel Rate (see Note   3  ).  Gains and losses from derivatives in the following tables represent the amounts reflected in income before the effect of PSA deferrals. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the following outstanding gross notional volume of derivatives, which represent both purchases and sales (does not reflect net position):  

Gains and Losses from Derivative Instruments 
    
  The following table provides information about gains and losses from derivative instruments in designated cash flow accounting hedging relationships during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands): 

(a) 
    During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had   no   losses reclassified from accumulated OCI to earnings related to discontinued cash flow hedges.

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

During the next twelve months, we estimate that a net loss of   $4 million   before income taxes will be reclassified from accumulated OCI as an offset to the effect of market price changes for the related hedged transactions.  In accordance with the PSA, most of these amounts will be recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability and have no immediate effect on earnings.

    Amounts are before the effect of PSA deferrals. 
       
  Derivative Instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets 
    
  Our derivative transactions are typically executed under standardized or customized agreements, which include collateral requirements and, in the event of a default, would allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.  Agreements that allow for the offsetting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty are considered master netting arrangements.  Transactions with counterparties that have master netting arrangements are offset and reported net on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Transactions that do not allow for offsetting of positive and negative positions are reported gross on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  We do not offset a counterparty s current derivative contracts with the counterparty s non-current derivative contracts, although our master netting arrangements would allow current and non-current positions to be offset in the event of a default.  Additionally, in the event of a default, our master netting arrangements would allow for the offsetting of all transactions executed under the master netting arrangement.  These types of transactions may include non-derivative instruments, derivatives qualifying for scope exceptions, trade receivables and trade payables arising from settled positions, and other forms of non-cash collateral (such as letters of credit).  These types of transactions are excluded from the offsetting tables presented below. 
    
  The significant majority of our derivative instruments are not currently designated as hedging instruments.  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , include gross liabilities of   $2 million   and   $3 million  , respectively, of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments.

Credit Risk and Credit Related Contingent Features 
    
  We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties and have risk management contracts with many counterparties. As of   September 30, 2016   we have no counterparties with positive exposures of greater than 10% of risk management assets. Our risk management process assesses and monitors the financial exposure of all counterparties.  Despite the fact that the great majority of trading counterparties  debt is rated as investment grade by the credit rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default, resulting in a material impact on consolidated earnings for a given period.  Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of financial institutions, major energy companies, municipalities and local distribution companies.  We maintain credit policies that we believe minimize overall credit risk to within acceptable limits.  Determination of the credit quality of our counterparties is based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings and our evaluation of their financial condition.  To manage credit risk, we employ collateral requirements and standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.  Valuation adjustments are established representing our estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to counterparties. 
    
  Certain of our derivative instrument contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features including, among other things, investment grade credit rating provisions, credit-related cross-default provisions, and adequate assurance provisions.  Adequate assurance provisions allow a counterparty with reasonable grounds for uncertainty to demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions.  For those derivative instruments in a net liability position, with investment grade credit contingencies, the counterparties could demand additional collateral if our debt credit rating were to fall below investment grade (below BBB- for Standard   Poor s or Fitch or Baa3 for Moody s). 
    
  The following table provides information about our derivative instruments that have credit-risk-related contingent features at   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):

  Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station 
    
  Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal 
    
  On December 19, 2012, APS, acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of Palo Verde, filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the United States Department of Energy ("DOE") in the United States Court of Federal Claims ("Court of Federal Claims").  The lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred  
  
   35 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

due to DOE s breach of the Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High Level Radioactive Waste ("Standard Contract") for failing to accept Palo Verde's spent nuclear fuel and high level waste from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2011, as it was required to do pursuant to the terms of the Standard Contract and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  On August 18, 2014, APS and DOE entered into a settlement agreement, stipulating to a dismissal of the lawsuit and payment of   $57.4 million   by DOE to the Palo Verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by Palo Verde during the period January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2011.  APS s share of this amount is   $16.7 million  .  Amounts recovered in the lawsuit and settlement were recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on the amount of reported net income.  In addition, the settlement agreement provides APS with a method for submitting claims and getting recovery for costs incurred through December 31, 2016. 
    
    APS has submitted   two   claims pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014 settlement agreement, for   two   separate time periods during July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2015.  The DOE has approved and paid   $53.9 million   for these claims (APS s share is   $15.7 million  ).   The amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income.  APS s next claim pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014 settlement agreement was submitted to the DOE on October 31, 2016, in the amount   $11.3 million   (APS s share is   $3.3 million  ) and payment is expected in the second quarter of 2017. 
    
  Nuclear Insurance  
    
  Public liability for incidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act ("Price-Anderson Act"), which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both commercial sources and an industry retrospective payment plan.  In accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, the Palo Verde participants are insured against public liability for a nuclear incident up to   $13.4 billion   per occurrence.  Palo Verde maintains the maximum available nuclear liability insurance in the amount of   $375 million  , which is provided by American Nuclear Insurers ("ANI").  The remaining balance of   $13 billion   of liability coverage is provided through a mandatory industry-wide retrospective assessment program.  If losses at any nuclear power plant covered by the program exceed the accumulated funds, APS could be assessed retrospective premium adjustments.  The maximum retrospective premium assessment per reactor under the program for each nuclear liability incident is approximately   $127.3 million  , subject to an annual limit of   $18.9 million   per incident, to be periodically adjusted for inflation.  Based on APS s ownership interest in the   three   Palo Verde units, APS s maximum potential retrospective premium assessment per incident for all   three   units is approximately   $111.1 million  , with a maximum annual retrospective premium assessment of approximately   $16.6 million  . 
    
  The Palo Verde participants maintain "all risk" (including nuclear hazards) insurance for property damage to, and decontamination of, property at Palo Verde in the aggregate amount of   $2.8 billion  , a substantial portion of which must first be applied to stabilization and decontamination.  APS has also secured insurance against portions of any increased cost of replacement generation or purchased power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and unforeseen accidental outage of any of the   three   units.  The property damage, decontamination, and replacement power coverages are provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited ("NEIL").  APS is subject to retrospective premium assessments under all NEIL policies if NEIL s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds.  The maximum amount APS could incur under the current NEIL policies totals approximately   $23.8 million   for each retrospective premium assessment declared by NEIL s Board of Directors due to losses.  In addition, NEIL policies contain rating triggers that would result in APS providing approximately   $64 million   of collateral assurance within   20   business days of a rating downgrade to non-investment grade.  The insurance coverage discussed in this and the previous paragraph is subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and exclusions.

Contractual Obligations 
    
  There have been no material changes, as of   September 30, 2016  , outside the normal course of business in contractual obligations from the information provided in our 2015 Form 10-K.  See Note 2 for discussion regarding changes in our long-term debt obligations. 
    
  Superfund-Related Matters 
    
  The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act ("Superfund") establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil, water or air.  Those who generated, transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are potentially responsible parties ("PRPs").  PRPs may be strictly, and often are jointly and severally, liable for clean-up.  On September 3, 2003, EPA advised APS that EPA considers APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52   nd    Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 ("OU3") in Phoenix, Arizona.  APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site.  APS and Pinnacle West have agreed with EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within OU3.  In addition, on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan ("RI/FS").  The OU3 working group parties have agreed to a schedule with EPA that calls for the submission of a revised draft RI/FS by June 2017.  We estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately   $2 million  .  We anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future, but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized, at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated. 
    
  On August 6, 2013, the Roosevelt Irrigation District ("RID") filed a lawsuit in Arizona District Court against APS and   24   other defendants, alleging that RID s groundwater wells were contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from facilities owned or operated by the defendants.  The lawsuit also alleges that, under Superfund laws, the defendants are jointly and severally liable to RID.  The allegations against APS arise out of APS s current and former ownership of facilities in and around OU3.  As part of a state governmental investigation into groundwater contamination in this area, on January 25, 2015, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality ("ADEQ") sent a letter to APS seeking information concerning the degree to which, if any, APS s current and former ownership of these facilities may have contributed to groundwater contamination in this area.    APS responded to ADEQ on May 4, 2015.    We are unable to predict the outcome of these matters; however, we do not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Southwest Power Outage 
    
  On September 8, 2011 at approximately 3:30 PM, a   500   kilovolt ("kV") transmission line running between the Hassayampa and North Gila substations in southwestern Arizona tripped out of service due to a fault that occurred at a switchyard operated by APS.  Approximately   ten minutes   after the transmission line went off-line, generation and transmission resources for the Yuma area were lost, resulting in approximately   69,700   APS customers losing service. 
    
  On September 6, 2013, a purported consumer class action complaint was filed in Federal District Court in San Diego, California, naming APS and Pinnacle West as defendants and seeking damages for loss of perishable inventory and sales as a result of interruption of electrical service.  APS and Pinnacle West filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted on December 9, 2013.  On January 13, 2014, the plaintiffs appealed the lower court s decision.  On March 2, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  
  
   37 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

unanimously affirmed the District Court's decision.  The plaintiffs filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc, which was denied on April 11, 2016. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste, hazardous waste, and coal combustion residuals ("CCRs").  These laws and regulations can change from time to time, imposing new obligations on APS resulting in increased capital, operating, and other costs.  Associated capital expenditures or operating costs could be material.  APS intends to seek recovery of any such environmental compliance costs through our rates, but cannot predict whether it will obtain such recovery.  The following proposed and final rules involve material compliance costs to APS. 
    
  Regional Haze Rules.      APS has received the final rulemaking imposing new requirements on Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station ("Navajo Plant").  EPA will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes best available retrofit technology ("BART") to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants.  EPA is currently in the process of considering a proposed rule for Regional Haze compliance at Cholla that does not involve the installation of new pollution controls and that will replace an earlier BART determination for this facility. 
    
  Four Corners.    Based on EPA s final standards, APS estimates that its   63%   share of the cost of these controls for Four Corners Units 4 and 5 would be approximately   $400 million  .  In addition, APS and El Paso Electric Company ("El Paso") entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by APS, or an affiliate of APS, of El Paso's   7%   interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5.  4CA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West, purchased the El Paso interest on July 6, 2016.  Navajo Transitional Energy Company, LLC ("NTEC") has the option to purchase the interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted to NTEC.  In December 2015, NTEC provided notice of its intent to exercise the option.  4CA is negotiating a definitive purchase agreement with NTEC for the purchase by NTEC of the   7%   interest.  The cost of the pollution controls related to the   7%   interest is approximately   $45 million  , which will be assumed by the ultimate owner of the   7%   interest.   
    
  Navajo Plant.    APS estimates that its share of costs for upgrades at the Navajo Plant, based on EPA s Federal Implementation Plan ("FIP"), could be up to approximately   $200 million  .  In October 2014, a coalition of environmental groups, an Indian tribe and others filed petitions for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit asking the Court to review EPA's final BART rule for the Navajo Plant.  We cannot predict the outcome of this review process.   
    
  Cholla.    APS believes that EPA s original 2012 final rule establishing controls constituting BART for Cholla, which would require installation of selective catalytic reduction ("SCR") controls with a cost to APS of approximately   $100 million     (excluding costs related to Cholla Unit 2, which was closed on October 1, 2015), is unsupported and that EPA had no basis for disapproving Arizona s State Implementation Plan ("SIP") and promulgating a FIP that is inconsistent with the state s considered BART determinations under the regional haze program.  Accordingly, on February 1, 2013, APS filed a Petition for Review of the final BART rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Briefing in the case was completed in February 2014.   
    
  In September 2014, APS met with EPA to propose a compromise BART strategy wherein, pending certain regulatory approvals, APS would permanently close Cholla Unit 2 and cease burning coal at Units 1 and 3 by the mid-2020s.  (See Note   3   for details related to the resulting regulatory asset.)  APS made the proposal with the understanding that additional emission control equipment is unlikely to be required in the  
  
   38 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

future because retiring and/or converting the units as contemplated in the proposal is more cost effective than, and will result in increased visibility improvement over, the current BART requirements for NOx imposed on the Cholla units under EPA's BART FIP.  APS s proposal involves state and federal rulemaking processes.  In light of these ongoing administrative proceedings, on February 19, 2015, APS, PacifiCorp (owner of Cholla Unit 4), and EPA jointly moved the court to sever and hold in abeyance those claims in the litigation pertaining to Cholla pending regulatory actions by the state and EPA.  The court granted the parties' unopposed motion on February 20, 2015.   
    
  On October 16, 2015, ADEQ issued the Cholla permit, which incorporates APS's proposal, and subsequently submitted a proposed revision to the SIP to the EPA, which would incorporate the new permit terms.  On June 30, 2016, EPA issued a proposed rule approving a revision to the Arizona SIP that incorporates APS s compromise approach for compliance with the Regional Haze program.  The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2016 and the public commenting period for this proposal ended on September 2, 2016.  APS and various other parties submitted comments in support of EPA's proposal, while Sierra Club submitted comments in opposition.  Once EPA s action is finalized, there may be judicial petitions for review of EPA s final action filed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  APS cannot predict at this time whether such petitions will be filed or if they will be successful. 
    
  Mercury and Air Toxic Standards ("MATS").    In 2011, EPA issued rules establishing maximum achievable control technology standards to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossil-fired plants.  APS estimates that the cost for the remaining equipment necessary to meet these standards is approximately   $8 million   for Cholla     (excluding costs related to Cholla Unit 2, which was closed on October 1, 2015).  No additional equipment is needed for Four Corners Units 4 and 5 to comply with these rules.  Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District ("SRP"), the operating agent for the Navajo Plant, estimates that APS's share of costs for equipment necessary to comply with the rules is approximately   $1 million  .  Litigation concerning the rules, including supplemental analyses EPA has prepared in support of the MATS regulation, is ongoing.  These proceedings   do not materially impact APS.  Regardless of the results from further judicial or administrative proceedings concerning the MATS rulemaking, the Arizona State Mercury Rule, the stringency of which is roughly equivalent to that of MATS, would still apply to Cholla. 
    
  Coal Combustion Waste  .    On December 19, 2014, EPA issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of CCR, such as fly ash and bottom ash.  The rule regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and Internet posting requirements.  The rule generally requires any existing unlined CCR surface impoundment that is contaminating groundwater above a regulated constituent s groundwater protection standard to stop receiving CCR and either retrofit or close, and further requires the closure of any CCR landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity. 
  Because the Subtitle D rule is self-implementing, the CCR standards apply directly to the regulated facility, and facilities are directly responsible for ensuring that their operations comply with the rule s requirements.  While EPA has chosen to regulate the disposal of CCR in landfills and surface impoundments as non-hazardous waste under the final rule, the agency makes clear that it will continue to evaluate any risks associated with CCR disposal and leaves open the possibility that it may regulate CCR as a hazardous waste under RCRA Subtitle C in the future.

APS currently disposes of CCR in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Cholla and Four Corners.  APS estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the CCR rule for Four Corners is approximately   $15 million  .  APS is currently evaluating compliance alternatives for Cholla and estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the CCR rule for this plant is approximately in the range of   $5 million   to   $40 million   based upon which compliance alternatives are ultimately selected.  The Navajo Plant currently disposes of CCR in a dry landfill storage area.  APS estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the CCR rule for the Navajo Plant is approximately   $1 million  .  Additionally, the CCR rule requires on-going groundwater monitoring.  Depending upon the results of such monitoring at each of Cholla, Four Corners and the Navajo Plant, we may be required to take corrective actions.  Because the initial monitoring at these plants is not yet complete, at the present time expenditures related to potential corrective actions cannot be reasonably estimated.   
    
  Pursuant to a June 24, 2016 order by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in the litigation by industry- and environmental-groups challenging EPA s CCR regulations, within the next   three   years EPA is required to complete a rulemaking proceeding concerning whether or not boron must be included on the list of groundwater constituents that might trigger corrective action under EPA s CCR rules.  EPA is not required to take final action approving the inclusion of boron, but EPA must propose and consider its inclusion.  Should EPA take final action adding boron to the list of groundwater constituents that might trigger corrective action, any resulting corrective action measures may increase APS's costs of compliance with the CCR rule at our coal-fired generating facilities.  At this time, though, APS cannot predict when EPA will commence its rulemaking concerning boron or the eventual results of those proceedings. 
    
  Clean Power Plan.    On August 3, 2015, EPA finalized carbon pollution standards for existing, new, modified, and reconstructed electric generating units ("EGUs").  EPA s final rules require newly built fossil fuel-fired EGUs, along with those undergoing modification or reconstruction, to meet CO   2    performance standards based on a combination of best operating practices and equipment upgrades.  EPA established separate performance standards for two types of EGUs: stationary combustion turbines, typically natural gas; and electric utility steam generating units, typically coal.   
    
  With respect to existing power plants, EPA s recently finalized  Clean Power Plan  imposes state-specific goals or targets to achieve reductions in CO   2    emission rates from existing EGUs measured from a 2012 baseline.  In a significant change from the proposed rule, EPA s final performance standards apply directly to specific units based upon their fuel-type and configuration (i.e., coal- or oil-fired steam plants versus combined cycle natural gas plants).  As such, each state s goal is an emissions performance standard that reflects the fuel mix employed by the EGUs in operation in those states.  The final rule provides guidelines to states to help develop their plans for meeting the interim (2022-2029) and final (2030 and beyond) emission performance standards, with three distinct compliance periods within that timeframe.  States were originally required to submit their plans to EPA by September 2016, with an optional   two  -year extension provided to states establishing a need for additional time; however, it is expected that this timing will be impacted by the court-imposed stay described below.   
    
  Prior to the court-imposed stay described below, ADEQ, with input from a technical working group comprised of Arizona utilities and other stakeholders, was working to develop a compliance plan for submittal to EPA.  Since the imposition of the stay, ADEQ reports that it is continuing to assess its options while completing outreach and soliciting feedback from stakeholders.  In addition to these on-going state proceedings, EPA has taken public comments on proposed model rules and a proposed federal compliance plan, which included consideration as to how the Clean Power Plan will apply to EGUs on tribal land such as the Navajo Nation.

The legality of the Clean Power Plan is being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit; the parties raising this challenge include, among others, the ACC.  On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review of the rule, which temporarily delays compliance obligations under the Clean Power Plan.  We cannot predict the extent of such a delay.   
    
  With respect to our Arizona generating units, we are currently evaluating the range of compliance options available to ADEQ, including whether Arizona deploys a rate- or mass-based compliance plan.   Based on the fuel-mix and location of our Arizona EGUs, and the significant investments we have made in renewable generation and demand-side energy efficiency, if ADEQ selects a rate-based compliance plan, we believe that we will be able to comply with the Clean Power Plan for our Arizona generating units in a manner that will not have material financial or operational impacts to the Company.  On the other hand, if ADEQ selects a mass-based approach to compliance with the Clean Power Plan, our annual cost of compliance could be material.  These costs could include costs to acquire mass-based compliance allowances.     
    
  As to our facilities on the Navajo Nation, EPA has yet to determine whether or to what extent EGUs on the Navajo Nation will be required to comply with the Clean Power Plan.  EPA has proposed to determine that it is necessary or appropriate to impose a federal plan on the Navajo Nation for compliance with the Clean Power Plan.  In response, we filed comments with EPA advocating that such a federal plan is neither necessary nor appropriate to protect air quality on the Navajo Nation.  If EPA reaches a determination that is consistent with our preferred approach for the Navajo Nation, we believe the Clean Power Plan will not have material financial or operational impacts on our operations within the Navajo Nation.   
    
  Alternatively, if EPA determines that a federal plan is necessary or appropriate for the Navajo Nation, and depending on our need for future operations at our EGUs located there, we may be unable to comply with the federal plan unless we acquire mass-based allowances or emission rate credits within established carbon trading markets, or curtail our operations.  Subject to the uncertainties set forth below, and assuming that EPA establishes a federal plan for the Navajo Nation that requires carbon allowances or credits to be surrendered for plan compliance, it is possible we will be required to purchase some quantity of credits or allowances, the cost of which could be material.     
    
  Because ADEQ has not issued its plan for Arizona, and because we do not know whether EPA will decide to impose a plan or, if so, what that plan will require, there are a number of uncertainties associated with our potential cost exposure.  These uncertainties include: whether judicial review will result in the Clean Power Plan being vacated in whole or in part or, if not, the extent of any resulting compliance deadline delays; whether any plan will be imposed for EGUs on the Navajo Nation; the future existence and liquidity of allowance or credit compliance trading markets; the applicability of existing contractual obligations with current and former owners of our participant-owned coal-fired EGUs; the type of federal or state compliance plan (either rate- or mass-based); whether or not the trading of allowances or credits will be authorized mechanisms for compliance with any final EPA or ADEQ plan; and how units that have been closed will be treated for allowance or credit allocation purposes.   
    
  In the event that the incurrence of compliance costs is not economically viable or prudent for our operations in Arizona or on the Navajo Nation, or if we do not have the option of acquiring allowances to account for the emissions from our operations, we may explore other options, including reduced levels of output or potential plant closures, as alternatives to purchasing allowances.  Given these uncertainties, our analysis of the available compliance options remains on-going, and additional information or considerations may arise that change our expectations.

Other environmental rules that could involve material compliance costs include those related to effluent limitations, the ozone national ambient air quality standard and other rules or matters involving the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, RCRA, Superfund, the Navajo Nation, and water supplies for our power plants.  The financial impact of complying with current and future environmental rules could jeopardize the economic viability of our coal plants or the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any required equipment upgrades or continue their participation in these plants.  The economics of continuing to own certain resources, particularly our coal plants, may deteriorate, warranting early retirement of those plants, which may result in asset impairments.  APS would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement, but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery.   
    
  Federal Agency Environmental Lawsuit Related to Four Corners  
    
    On December 21, 2015, several environmental groups filed a notice of intent to sue with Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement ("OSM") and other federal agencies under the Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) alleging that OSM s reliance on the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement prepared in connection with a federal environmental review were not in accordance with applicable law.  The environmental review was undertaken as part of the United States Department of the Interior's ("DOI's") review process necessary to allow for the effectiveness of lease amendments and related rights-of-way renewals for Four Corners.  This review process also required separate environmental impact evaluations under the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) and culminated in the issuance of a Record of Decision justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine.   
    
  On April 20, 2016, the same environmental groups followed through with their notice of intent to sue by filing a lawsuit against OSM and other DOI federal agencies in the District of Arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of Four Corners and the adjacent mine.  Expanding     upon the December 2015 ESA notice, the lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the ESA and NEPA in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at the Four Corners Power Plant and the adjacent Navajo Mine past July 6, 2016.  APS filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings, which was granted on August 3, 2016.  Briefing on the merits of this litigation is expected to extend through May 2017.  On September 15, 2016, NTEC, the company that owns the adjacent mine, filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on NTEC's tribal sovereign immunity.  The court's consideration of this motion could affect the schedule for this litigation.  We cannot predict the outcome of this matter or its potential effect on Four Corners  .    
       
     New Mexico Tax Matter 
    
  On May 23, 2013, the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department ("NMTRD") issued a notice of assessment for coal severance surtax, penalty, and interest totaling approximately   $30 million   related to coal supplied under the coal supply agreement for Four Corners (the "Assessment").  APS s share of the Assessment is approximately   $12 million  .  For procedural reasons, on behalf of the Four Corners co-owners, including APS, the coal supplier made a partial payment of the Assessment in the amount of   $0.8 million   and immediately filed a refund claim with respect to that partial payment in August 2013.  The NMTRD denied the refund claim.  On December 19, 2013, the coal supplier and APS, on its own behalf and as operating agent for Four Corners, filed a complaint with the New Mexico District Court contesting both the validity of the Assessment and the refund claim denial.  On June 30, 2015, the court ruled that the Assessment was not valid and further ruled that APS and the other Four Corners co-owners receive a refund of all of the contested amounts previously paid under the applicable tax statute.  The NMTRD filed an appeal of the decision on August 31, 2015.   
  
   42 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

On March 16, 2016, APS and the coal supplier entered into a final settlement agreement with the NMTRD with respect to the Assessment. Pursuant to the final settlement agreement, the NMTRD agreed to release the Assessment, dismiss its filed appeal, and release its rights to any other surtax claims with respect to the coal supply agreement. APS and the other Four Corners co-owners agreed to forgo refund rights with respect to all of the contested amounts previously paid under the applicable tax statute, as well as pay   $1 million  . APS's share of this settlement payment, together with its share of the partial payment described above is approximately   $0.8 million  . 
     
  Financial Assurances 
    
  In the normal course of business, we obtain standby letters of credit and surety bonds from financial institutions and other third parties.  These instruments guarantee our own future performance and provide third parties with financial and performance assurance in the event we do not perform. These instruments support certain debt arrangements, commodity contract collateral obligations, and other transactions.  As of   September 30, 2016  , standby letters of credit totaled   $52 million   and will expire in 2016 and 2017.  As of   September 30, 2016  , surety bonds expiring through 2019 totaled   $150 million  .  The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected on our balance sheets, where applicable. Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the letters of credit and surety bonds themselves.  
    
  We enter into agreements that include indemnification provisions relating to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements.  Most significantly, APS has agreed to indemnify the equity participants and other parties in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions with respect to certain tax matters.  Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in the indemnification provisions and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnification provisions cannot be reasonably estimated.  Based on historical experience and evaluation of the specific indemnities, we do not believe that any material loss related to such indemnification provisions is likely. 
    
  Pinnacle West has issued parental guarantees and has provided indemnification under certain surety bonds for APS which were not material at   September 30, 2016  .  Effective July 6, 2016, Pinnacle West has issued   two   parental guarantees for 4CA     relating to payment obligations arising from 4CA s acquisition of El Paso s   7%   interest in Four Corners, and pursuant to the Four Corners participation agreement payment obligations arising from 4CA s ownership interest in Four Corners. 
    
  Peabody Bankruptcy 
    
  On April 13, 2016, Peabody Energy Corporation and certain affiliated entities filed a petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.  Under a Coal Supply Agreement, dated December 21, 2005, Peabody supplied coal to APS and PacifiCorp (collectively, the  Buyers ) for use at the Cholla power plant in Arizona.  APS believes that the Coal Supply Agreement terminated automatically on April 13, 2016 as a result of Peabody's bankruptcy filing.  The Buyers filed a motion requesting that the Bankruptcy Court enter an order determining that the Buyers are authorized to enforce the termination provisions in the Coal Supply Agreement.   
    
  On May 13, 2016, Peabody filed a complaint against the Buyers in the bankruptcy court in which Peabody alleges that the Buyers have breached the Agreement. Peabody requests substantial, but unspecified, monetary damages from the Buyers.  Peabody and the Buyers have agreed to pursue non-binding mediation, failing which a trial is expected to begin in February 2017.  There is insufficient information at this time to reasonably estimate any possible loss or range of loss to the Company.

    Fair Value Measurements    
       
  We classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value within the fair value hierarchy.  This hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the inputs used to determine fair values, which are then classified and disclosed in one of three categories.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: 
    
  Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.  Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide information on an ongoing basis.  This category includes exchange traded equities, exchange traded derivative instruments, exchange traded mutual funds, cash equivalents, and investments in U.S. Treasury securities. 
    
  Level 2   Utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable (such as yield curves).  This category includes non-exchange traded contracts such as forwards, options, swaps and certain investments in fixed income securities.      
    
  Level 3   Valuation models with significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.  Instruments in this category include long-dated derivative transactions where valuations are unobservable due to the length of the transaction, options, and transactions in locations where observable market data does not exist.  The valuation models we employ utilize spot prices, forward prices, historical market data and other factors to forecast future prices. 
    
  Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Thus, a valuation may be classified in Level 3 even though the valuation may include significant inputs that are readily observable.  We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize  
  
   45 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

the use of unobservable inputs.  We rely primarily on the market approach of using prices and other market information for identical and/or comparable assets and liabilities.  If market data is not readily available, inputs may reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use.  Our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities as well as their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.  We assess whether a market is active by obtaining observable broker quotes, reviewing actual market activity, and assessing the volume of transactions.  We consider broker quotes observable inputs when the quote is binding on the broker, we can validate the quote with market activity, or we can determine that the inputs the broker used to arrive at the quoted price are observable. 
    
  Certain instruments have been valued using the concept of Net Asset Value ( NAV ), as a practical expedient. These instruments are typically structured as investment companies offering shares or units to multiple investors for the purpose of providing a return. These instruments are similar to mutual funds; however, they are not traded on an exchange. During the first quarter of 2016 we retrospectively adopted new accounting guidance that requires instruments valued using NAV, as a practical expedient, to no longer be classified within the fair value hierarchy. As such, instruments valued using NAV, as a practical expedient, are included in our fair value disclosures and tables in a separate column; however, these investments are not classified within any of the fair value hierarchy levels. Prior to the adoption of this guidance these instruments were typically reported within Level 2 or Level 3. The adoption of this guidance changes our fair value disclosures, but does not impact the methodology for valuing these instruments, or our financial statement results.   
    
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
    
  We apply recurring fair value measurements to certain cash equivalents, derivative instruments, investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trust, plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans and coal reclamation trust investments.  See Note 7 in the 2015 Form 10-K for the fair value discussion of plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans. 
    
  Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash equivalents represent short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less in exchange traded money market funds that are valued using quoted prices in active markets. 
    
  Coal Reclamation Trust Investments 
       
  The coal reclamation trust holds cash equivalent investments in money market funds that are valued using quoted prices in active markets, and are reported within Level 1.   
    
  Risk Management Activities   Derivative Instruments 
    
  Exchange traded commodity contracts are valued using unadjusted quoted prices.  For non-exchange traded commodity contracts, we calculate fair value based on the average of the bid and offer price, discounted to reflect net present value.  We maintain certain valuation adjustments for a number of risks associated with the valuation of future commitments.  These include valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risks.  The liquidity valuation adjustment represents the cost that would be incurred if all unmatched positions were closed out or hedged.  The credit valuation adjustment represents estimated credit losses on our net exposure to counterparties, taking into account netting agreements, expected default experience for the credit rating of the  
  
   46 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

counterparties and the overall diversification of the portfolio.  We maintain credit policies that management believes minimize overall credit risk. 
    
  Certain non-exchange traded commodity contracts are valued based on unobservable inputs due to the long-term nature of contracts, characteristics of the product, or the unique location of the transactions.  Our long-dated energy transactions consist of observable valuations for the near-term portion and unobservable valuations for the long-term portions of the transaction.  We rely primarily on broker quotes to value these instruments.  When our valuations utilize broker quotes, we perform various control procedures to ensure the quote has been developed consistent with fair value accounting guidance.  These controls include assessing the quote for reasonableness by comparison against other broker quotes, reviewing historical price relationships, and assessing market activity.  When broker quotes are not available, the primary valuation technique used to calculate the fair value is the extrapolation of forward pricing curves using observable market data for more liquid delivery points in the same region and actual transactions at more illiquid delivery points. 
    
  Option contracts are primarily valued using a Black-Scholes option valuation model, which utilizes both observable and unobservable inputs such as broker quotes, interest rates and price volatilities. 
    
  When the unobservable portion is significant to the overall valuation of the transaction, the entire transaction is classified as Level 3.  Our classification of instruments as Level 3 is primarily reflective of the long-term nature of our energy transactions and the use of option valuation models with significant unobservable inputs. 
    
  Our energy risk management committee, consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees our energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies.  We have a risk control function that is responsible for valuing our derivative commodity instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures.  The risk control function reports to the chief financial officer s organization. 
    
  Investments Held in our Nuclear Decommissioning Trust 
    
  The nuclear decommissioning trust invests in fixed income securities and equity securities. Equity securities are held indirectly through commingled funds.  The commingled funds are valued using the funds' NAV as a practical expedient. The funds' NAV is primarily derived from the quoted active market prices of the underlying equity securities held by the funds.  We may transact in these commingled funds on a semi-monthly basis at the NAV.  The commingled funds are maintained by a bank and hold investments in accordance with the stated objective of tracking the performance of the S P 500 Index.  Because the commingled funds' shares are offered to a limited group of investors, they are not considered to be traded in an active market. As these instruments are valued using NAV, as a practical expedient, they have not been classified within the fair value hierarchy.  
    
  Cash equivalents reported within Level 1 represent investments held in a short-term investment exchange-traded mutual fund, which invests in certificates of deposit, variable rate notes, time deposit accounts, U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, and commercial paper.  
    
  Fixed income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury held directly by the nuclear decommissioning trust are valued using quoted active market prices and are typically classified as Level 1.  Fixed income securities issued by corporations, municipalities, and other agencies, including mortgage-backed instruments, are valued using quoted inactive market prices, quoted active market prices for similar securities, or by utilizing calculations which incorporate observable inputs such as yield curves and spreads relative to such yield curves.   
  
   47 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

These instruments are classified as Level 2.  Whenever possible, multiple market quotes are obtained which enables a cross-check validation.  A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class, or issue of securities. 
    
  We price securities using information provided by our trustee for our nuclear decommissioning trust assets. Our trustee uses pricing services that utilize the valuation methodologies described to determine fair market value. We have internal control procedures designed to ensure this information is consistent with fair value accounting guidance. These procedures include assessing valuations using an independent pricing source, verifying that pricing can be supported by actual recent market transactions, assessing hierarchy classifications, comparing investment returns with benchmarks, and obtaining and reviewing independent audit reports on the trustee s internal operating controls and valuation processes. See Note   11   for additional discussion about our nuclear decommissioning trust.

              (c) 
    Valued using NAV as a practical expedient, and therefore not classified in the fair value hierarchy. 
              (d) 
    Represents nuclear decommissioning trust net pending securities sales and purchases. 
       
  Fair Value Measurements Classified as Level 3 
    
  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our energy derivative contracts include broker quotes that cannot be validated as an observable input primarily due to the long-term nature of the quote and option model inputs.  Significant changes in these inputs in isolation would result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements.  Changes in our derivative contract fair values,  
  
   49 

COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

including changes relating to unobservable inputs, typically will not impact net income due to regulatory accounting treatment (see Note   3  ). 
    
  Because our forward commodity contracts classified as Level 3 are currently in a net purchase position, we would expect price increases of the underlying commodity to result in increases in the net fair value of the related contracts.  Conversely, if the price of the underlying commodity decreases, the net fair value of the related contracts would likely decrease. 
    
  Our option contracts classified as Level 3 primarily relate to purchase heat rate options.  The significant unobservable inputs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for these instruments include electricity prices and volatilities. If electricity prices and electricity price volatilities increase, we would expect the fair value of these options to increase, and if these valuation inputs decrease, we would expect the fair value of these options to decrease.  If natural gas prices and natural gas price volatilities increase, we would expect the fair value of these options to decrease, and if these inputs decrease, we would expect the fair value of the options to increase.  The commodity prices and volatilities do not always move in corresponding directions.  The options  fair values are impacted by the net changes of these various inputs. 
    
  Other unobservable valuation inputs include credit and liquidity reserves which do not have a material impact on our valuations; however, significant changes in these inputs could also result in higher or lower fair value measurements. 
    
  The following tables provide information regarding our significant unobservable inputs used to value our risk management derivative Level 3 instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(a) 
    Includes swaps and physical and financial contracts. 
              (b) 
    The remaining option contract expired on October 1, 2016; therefore there are no ranges for price and volatilities.

    Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts    
       
  To fund the costs APS expects to incur to decommission Palo Verde, APS established external decommissioning trusts in accordance with NRC regulations.  Third-party investment managers are authorized to buy and sell securities per stated investment guidelines.  The trust funds are invested in fixed income securities and equity securities.  APS classifies investments in decommissioning trust funds as available for sale.  As a result, we record the decommissioning trust funds at their fair value on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  See Note   10   for a discussion of how fair value is determined and the classification of the nuclear decommissioning trust investments within the fair value hierarchy.  Because of the ability of APS to recover decommissioning costs in rates and in accordance with the regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds, we have deferred realized and unrealized gains and losses (including other-than-temporary impairments on investment securities) in other regulatory liabilities  .    The following table includes the unrealized gains and losses based on the original cost of the investment and summarizes the fair value of APS s nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):

12  .      New Accounting Standards    
    
  In May 2014, a new revenue recognition accounting standard was issued. This standard provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. Since the issuance of the new revenue standard, additional guidance has been issued to clarify certain aspects of the new revenue standard, including principal versus agent considerations, identifying performance obligations, and other narrow scope improvements. The new revenue standard, and related amendments, will be effective for us on January 1, 2018.  The guidance may be adopted using a full retrospective application or a simplified transition method that allows entities to record a cumulative effect adjustment in retained earnings at the date of initial application.  We are currently evaluating the new standard, and related amendments, and the impacts it may have on our financial statements.  
    
  In January 2016, a new accounting standard was issued relating to the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance will require certain investments in equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, and modifies the impairment assessment of certain equity securities.  The new guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2018. Certain aspects of the guidance may require a cumulative effect adjustment and other aspects of the guidance are required to be adopted prospectively.  We are currently evaluating this new accounting standard and the impacts it may have on our financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, a new lease accounting standard was issued. This new standard supersedes the existing lease accounting model, and modifies both lessee and lessor accounting. The new guidance will require a lessee to reflect most operating lease arrangements on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability that will initially be measured at the present value of lease payments. Among other changes, the new standard also modifies the definition of a lease, and requires expanded lease disclosures. The  
  
   53

new standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early application permitted. The guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with various optional practical expedients provided to facilitate transition. We are currently evaluating this new accounting standard and the impacts it may have on our financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, new stock compensation accounting guidance was issued that modifies the accounting for employee share-based payments. The new guidance will require all tax benefits and deficiencies arising from share-based payments to be recognized in net income, modifies the tax withholding threshold for awards to qualify for equity classification, simplifies accounting for forfeitures, and clarifies certain cash flow presentation matters.  The new guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2017, with early application permitted. Certain aspects of the guidance must be adopted using a prospective approach and other aspects will be adopted using a retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating this new accounting standard and the impacts it may have on our financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, new accounting guidance was issued that amends the measurement of credit losses on certain financial instruments. The new guidance will require entities to use a current expected credit loss model to measure impairment of certain investments in debt securities, trade accounts receivables, and other financial instruments. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2020 and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for certain aspects of the standard, and a prospective approach for other aspects of the standard.  We are currently evaluating this new accounting standard and the impacts it may have on our financial statements.

    Asset Retirement Obligations    
       
  In the second quarter of 2016, APS recognized an asset retirement obligation ( ARO ) for the Ocotillo steam units as a condition of the air permit (issued in 2016) to allow the construction and operation of   five   new turbine units.  This resulted in an increase to the ARO in the amount of   $10 million  . 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, 4CA acquired El Paso Electric s share of Four Corners Units 4   5 and the associated ARO.  This resulted in an increase to the ARO in the amount of   $9 million  .

ITEM 2.                MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL     CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  INTRODUCTION 
    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Pinnacle West s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and APS s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Combined Notes that appear in Item 1 of this report.  For information on factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate, see "Forward-Looking Statements" at the front of this report and "Risk Factors" in Part 1, Item 1A of the 2015 Form 10-K. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  Pinnacle West owns all of the outstanding common stock of APS.  APS is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona.  APS currently accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings. 
    
  Areas of Business Focus 
    
  Operational Performance, Reliability and Recent Developments. 
    
  Coal and Related Environmental Matters and Transactions.    APS is a joint owner of three coal-fired power plants and acts as operating agent for two of the plants.  APS is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from increased regulation and potential legislation concerning GHG emissions.  On June 2, 2014, EPA proposed a rule to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants (the "Clean Power Plan"), and EPA finalized its proposal on August 3, 2015.   
    
  EPA s nationwide CO   2    emissions reduction goal is 32% below 2005 emission levels.  As finalized for the state of Arizona and the Navajo Nation, compliance with the Clean Power Plan could involve a shift in generation from coal to natural gas and renewable generation.  Until implementation plans for these jurisdictions are finalized, we are unable to determine the actual impacts to APS.  (See Note 7 for information regarding challenges to the legality of the Clean Power Plan and a court-ordered stay of the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review of the rule, which temporarily delays compliance obligations.)  APS continually analyzes its long-range capital management plans to assess the potential effects of these changes, understanding that any resulting regulation and legislation could impact the economic viability of certain plants, as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to continue participation in such plants.  
    
  Cholla 
    
  On September 11, 2014, APS announced that it would close its 260 MW Unit 2 at Cholla and cease burning coal at Units 1 and 3 by the mid-2020s if EPA approves a compromise proposal offered by APS to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules.  On April 14, 2015, the ACC approved APS's plan to retire Unit 2, without expressing any view on the future recoverability of APS's remaining investment in the Unit.  (See Note   3   for details related to the resulting regulatory asset and Note 7 for details of the proposal.)  APS believes that the environmental benefits of this proposal are greater in the long term than the benefits that would have resulted from adding emissions control equipment.  APS closed Unit 2 on October 1, 2015.   

57 

Four Corners 
    
  Asset Purchase Agreement and Coal Supply Matters.    On December 30, 2013, APS purchased SCE s 48% interest in each of Units 4 and 5 of Four Corners.  The final purchase price for the interest was approximately $182 million.  In connection with APS s prior retail rate case with the ACC, the ACC reserved the right to review the prudence of the Four Corners transaction for cost recovery purposes upon the closing of the transaction.  On December 23, 2014, the ACC approved rate adjustments related to APS s acquisition of SCE s interest in Four Corners resulting in a revenue increase of $57.1 million on an annual basis.  On February 23, 2015, the ACC decision approving the rate adjustments was appealed.  APS has intervened and is actively participating in the proceeding.  The Arizona Court of Appeals suspended the appeal pending the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in the SIB matter discussed below.  On August 8, 2016, the Arizona Supreme Court issued its opinion in the SIB matter, and the Arizona Court of Appeals has now ordered supplemental briefing on how that SIB decision should affect the challenge to the Four Corners rate adjustment.  We cannot predict when or how this matter will be resolved. 
    
  Concurrently with the closing of the SCE transaction described above, BHP Billiton New Mexico Coal, Inc. ("BHP Billiton"), the parent company of BHP Navajo Coal Company ("BNCC"), the coal supplier and operator of the mine that serves Four Corners, transferred its ownership of BNCC to NTEC, a company formed by the Navajo Nation to own the mine and develop other energy projects.  BHP Billiton will be retained by NTEC under contract as the mine manager and operator through 2016.  Also occurring concurrently with the closing, the Four Corners  co-owners executed the 2016 Coal Supply Agreement for the supply of coal to Four Corners from July 2016, when the current coal supply agreement expires, through 2031.  El Paso, a 7% owner in Units 4 and 5 of Four Corners, did not sign the 2016 Coal Supply Agreement.  Under the 2016 Coal Supply Agreement, APS agreed to assume the 7% shortfall obligation.  On February 17, 2015, APS and El Paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by APS, or an affiliate of APS, of El Paso s 7% interest in each of Units 4 and 5 of Four Corners.  The cash purchase price is immaterial in amount, and the purchaser will assume El Paso's reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7% interest.   4CA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West, purchased the El Paso interest on July 6, 2016.    
  NTEC has the option to purchase the 7% interest within a certain timeframe pursuant to an option granted to NTEC.  On December 29, 2015, NTEC provided notice of its intent to exercise the option.  4CA is negotiating a definitive purchase agreement with NTEC for the purchase by NTEC of the 7% interest.  The 2016 Coal Supply Agreement contains alternate pricing terms for the 7% shortfall obligations in the event NTEC does not purchase the interest.   
    
  Lease Extension.    APS, on behalf of the Four Corners participants, negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the Navajo Nation, which extends the Four Corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041.  The Navajo Nation approved these amendments in March 2011.  The effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the DOI, as did a related federal rights-of-way grant.  A federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the DOI review process, and culminated in the issuance by DOI of a record of decision on July 17, 2015 justifying the agency action extending the life of the plant and the adjacent mine.     
    
  On April 20, 2016, several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against OSM and other DOI federal agencies in the District of Arizona in connection with their issuance of the approvals that extended the life of Four Corners and the adjacent mine.  The lawsuit alleges that these federal agencies violated both the ESA and NEPA in providing the federal approvals necessary to extend operations at the Four Corners Power Plant and the adjacent Navajo Mine past July 6, 2016.  APS filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings, which was granted on August 3, 2016.  Briefing on the merits of this litigation is expected to extend through May 2017.  On September 15, 2016, NTEC filed a motion to intervene for the purpose of dismissing the lawsuit based on  
  
   58 

NTEC's tribal sovereign immunity.  The court's consideration of this motion could affect the schedule for this litigation.  We cannot predict the outcome of this matter or its potential effect on Four Corners  . 
    
  Natural Gas.    APS has six natural gas power plants located throughout Arizona, including Ocotillo. Ocotillo is a 330 MW 4-unit gas plant located in the metropolitan Phoenix area.  In early 2014, APS announced a project to modernize the plant, which involves retiring two older 110 MW steam units, adding five 102 MW combustion turbines and maintaining two existing 55 MW combustion turbines.  In total, this increases the capacity of the site by 290 MW, to 620 MW, with completion targeted by summer 2019.  (See Note 3 for proposed rate recovery in our current retail rate case filing.)  APS completed a competitive solicitation process in which the Ocotillo project was evaluated against other alternatives.  Consistent with the independent monitor s report, the Ocotillo project was selected as the best alternative.  APS must finalize the permitting process, including any EPA Environmental Appeals Board ("EAB") reviews, before construction can begin.  On April 21, 2016, the Sierra Club filed a petition with the EAB to review the Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD") permit issued by Maricopa County, Arizona for the Ocotillo project.  On September 1, 2016, the EAB issued a decision regarding the petition for review that denied Sierra Club's request to remand the PSD permit.  On September 9, 2016, Maricopa County issued a final permit decision based on the EAB review that finalizes the PSD authorization to construct the Ocotillo modernization project. 
    
  Transmission and Delivery.    APS is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that continue to support system reliability, access to markets and renewable energy development.  The capital expenditures table presented in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below includes new APS transmission projects through 2018, along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements.  APS is also working to establish and expand advanced grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide long-term benefits both to APS and its customers.  APS is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better manage their energy usage, minimize system outage durations and frequency, enable customer choice for behind-the-meter technologies, and facilitate greater cost savings to APS through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions. 
    
  Energy Imbalance Market.    In 2015, APS and the California Independent System Operator ("CAISO"), the operator for the majority of California's transmission grid, signed an agreement for APS to begin participation in the Energy Imbalance Market ( EIM ).  APS's participation in the EIM began on October 1, 2016.  The EIM allows for rebalancing supply and demand in 15-minute blocks with dispatching every five minutes before the energy is needed, instead of the traditional one hour blocks.  APS expects that its participation in EIM will lower its fuel costs, improve visibility and situational awareness for system operations in the Western Interconnection power grid, and improve integration of APS s renewable resources.   
    
  Renewable Energy  .    The ACC approved the RES in 2006.  The renewable energy requirement is 6% of retail electric sales in 2016 and increases annually until it reaches 15% in 2025.  In the 2009 Settlement Agreement, APS agreed to exceed the RES standards, committing to use APS s best efforts to obtain 1,700 GWh of new renewable resources to be in service by year-end 2015, in addition to its RES renewable resource commitments.  APS met its settlement commitment and RES target for 2015.  A component of the RES targets development of distributed energy systems. 
    
  In December of 2014, the ACC voted that it had no objection to APS implementing an APS-owned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid.  The first stage of the program, called the "Solar Partner Program," placed 8 MW of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits, as well as make systems available to limited-income customers who cannot easily install solar through transactions with third parties. The second stage of the program, which includes an additional 2 MW of rooftop solar and energy storage, will place two energy storage systems sized at 2 MW on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various grid-related operation improvements  
  
   59 

and system interoperability, and is planned to be in operation by the end of 2016.  The ACC expressly reserved that any determination of prudency of the residential rooftop solar program for rate making purposes shall not be made until the project is fully in service and APS requests cost recovery in a future rate case. 
  On July 1, 2015, APS filed its 2016 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a RES budget of approximately $148 million.  On January 12, 2016, the ACC approved APS s plan and requested budget.  
    
  On July 1, 2016, APS filed its 2017 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $150 million.  APS s budget request included additional funding to process the high volume of residential rooftop solar interconnection requests and also requested a permanent waiver of the residential distributed energy requirement for 2017 contained in the RES rules.  
    
  In September of 2016, the ACC initiated a proceeding which will examine the possible modernization and expansion of the RES.  The ACC noted that many of the provisions of the original rule may no longer be appropriate, and the underlying economic assumptions associated with the rule have changed dramatically.  The proceeding will review such issues as the rapidly declining cost of solar generation, an increased interest in community solar projects, energy storage options, and the decline in fossil fuel generation due to stringent EPA regulations.  The proceeding will also examine the feasibility of increasing the standard to 30% of retail sales by 2030, in contrast to the current standard of 15% of retail sales by 2025.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. 
    
  The following table summarizes renewable energy sources in APS's renewable portfolio that are in operation and under development as of November 3, 2016.  

(a)             Included in the 189 MW number is 170 MW of solar resources procured through the Company's AZ Sun Program. 
  (b)              Includes rooftop solar facilities owned by third parties.  Distributed generation is produced in DC and is converted to AC for reporting purposes. 
           (c) 
    This amount represents APS-owned grid scale and distributed generation projects currently under development.  Projects include the 40 MW Red Rock Solar Plant and the Solar Partner Program discussed above.  Upon completion of construction, these projects will be considered "in operation" for purposes of this table. 
              (d) 
    Applications received by APS that are not yet installed and online. 

60 

APS has developed owned solar resources through the ACC-approved AZ Sun Program.  APS has invested approximately $675 million in its AZ Sun Program.    
    
  Demand Side Management.    In December 2009, Arizona regulators placed an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy, while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy.  The ACC initiated an Energy Efficiency rulemaking, with a proposed Energy Efficiency Standard of 22% cumulative annual energy savings by 2020.  The 22% figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through 2020 attributable to energy efficiency initiatives.  This standard became effective on January 1, 2011. 
    
  In March 2014 the ACC approved a Resource Savings Initiative that allows APS to count towards compliance with the ACC Electric Energy Efficiency Standards, savings from improvements to APS s transmission and delivery system, generation and facilities that have been approved through a DSM Plan. 
       
  On March 20, 2015, APS filed an application with the ACC requesting a budget of $68.9 million for 2015 and minor modifications to its DSM portfolio going forward, including for the first time three resource savings projects which reflect energy savings on APS's system.    The ACC approved APS s 2015 DSM budget on November 25, 2015.  In its decision, the ACC also approved that verified energy savings from APS s resource savings projects could be counted toward compliance with the Electric Energy Efficiency Standard, however, the ACC ruled that APS was not allowed to count savings from systems savings projects toward determination of its achievement tier level for its performance incentive, nor may APS include savings from conservation voltage reduction in the calculation of its LFCR mechanism.  
    
  On June 1, 2015, APS filed its 2016 DSM Plan requesting a budget of $68.9 million and minor modifications to its DSM portfolio to increase energy savings and cost effectiveness of the programs.  On April 1, 2016, APS filed an amended 2016 DSM Plan that sought minor modifications to its existing DSM Plan and requested to continue the current DSMAC and current budget of $68.9 million.  On July 12, 2016, the ACC approved APS s amended DSM Plan and directed APS to spend up to an additional $4 million on a new residential demand response or load management program that facilitates energy storage technology. 
    
  Electric Energy Efficiency.    On June 27, 2013, the ACC voted to open a new docket investigating whether the Electric Energy Efficiency Standards should be modified.  The ACC held a series of three workshops in March and April 2014 to investigate methodologies used to determine cost effective energy efficiency programs, cost recovery mechanisms, incentives, and potential changes to the Electric Energy Efficiency and Resource Planning Rules. 
    
    On November 4, 2014, the ACC staff issued a request for informal comment on a draft of possible amendments to Arizona s Electric Utility Energy Efficiency Standards.  The draft proposed substantial changes to the rules and energy efficiency standards.    The ACC accepted written comments and took public comment regarding the possible amendments on December 19, 2014.  A formal rulemaking has not been initiated and there has been no additional action on the draft to date.  On July 12, 2016, the ACC ordered that ACC staff convene a workshop within 120 days to discuss a number of issues related to the Electric Energy Efficiency Standards, including the process of determining the cost effectiveness of DSM programs and the treatment of peak demand and capacity reductions, among others. 
    
  Rate Matters.    APS needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain its financial health.  APS s retail rates are regulated by the ACC and its wholesale electric rates (primarily for transmission) are regulated by FERC.  On June 1, 2011, APS filed a rate case with the ACC.  APS and other parties to the retail rate case subsequently entered into the 2012 Settlement Agreement detailing the terms upon which the parties have agreed to settle the rate case.  See Note   3   for details regarding the 2012 Settlement Agreement terms and for information on APS s FERC rates. 
  
   61 

On June 1, 2016, APS filed an application with the ACC for an annual increase in retail base rates of $165.9 million.  This amount excludes amounts that are currently collected on customer bills through adjustor mechanisms.  The application requests that some of the balances in these adjustor accounts (aggregating to approximately $267.6 million as of December 31, 2015) be transferred into base rates through the ratemaking process.  This transfer would not have an incremental effect on customer bills.  The average annual customer bill impact of APS s request is an increase of 5.74% (the average annual bill impact for a typical APS residential customer is 7.96%  )  .  APS's application also addresses rate design changes (residential, commercial and industrial), permission to defer for potential future recovery costs associated with the Ocotillo Modernization Project, permission to defer for potential future recovery costs associated with environmental standards compliance, inclusion of post-test year plant and modifications to certain adjustor mechanisms, among other items.  APS requested that the increase become effective July 1, 2017.  On July 22, 2016, the administrative law judge set a procedural schedule for the rate proceedings. The ACC staff and interveners will begin filing their direct testimony on December 21, 2016, and the hearing will commence on March 22, 2017. The Commission staff supports completing the case within 12 months.  APS cannot predict the outcome of its request.   
    
  APS has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to APS of its fuel and transmission costs, and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs.  These mechanisms are described more fully in Note 3. 
    
  As part of APS s acquisition of SCE s interest in Units 4 and 5, APS and SCE agreed, via a "Transmission Termination Agreement" that, upon closing of the acquisition, the companies would terminate an existing transmission agreement ("Transmission Agreement") between the parties that provides transmission capacity on a system (the "Arizona Transmission System") for SCE to transmit its portion of the output from Four Corners to California.  APS previously submitted a request to FERC related to this termination, which resulted in a FERC order denying rate recovery of $40 million that APS agreed to pay SCE associated with the termination.  On December 22, 2015, APS and SCE agreed to terminate the Transmission Termination Agreement and allow for the Transmission Agreement to expire according to its terms, which includes settling obligations in accordance with the terms of the Transmission Agreement.  APS established a regulatory asset of $12 million in 2015 in connection with the payment required under the terms of the Transmission Agreement.  On July 1, 2016, FERC issued an order denying APS s request to recover the regulatory asset through its FERC-jurisdictional rates.  APS and SCE completed the termination of the Transmission Agreement on July 6, 2016.  APS made the required payment to SCE and wrote-off the $12 million regulatory asset and charged operating revenues to reflect this order in the second quarter of 2016.  On July 29, 2016, APS filed for a rehearing with FERC.  In its order denying recovery FERC also referred to its enforcement division a question of whether the agreement between APS and SCE relating to the settlement of obligations under the Transmission Agreement was a jurisdictional contract that should have been filed with FERC. APS cannot predict the outcome of either matter. 
     
  Net Metering.        On July 12, 2013, APS filed an application with the ACC proposing a solution to address the cost shift brought by the current net metering rules.  On December 3, 2013, the ACC issued its order on APS s net metering proposal.  The ACC instituted a charge on customers who install rooftop solar panels after December 31, 2013.  The charge of $0.70 per kilowatt became effective on January 1, 2014, and is estimated to collect $4.90 per month from a typical future rooftop solar customer to help pay for their use of the electric grid.   The fixed charge does not increase APS's revenue because it is credited to the LFCR. 
    
  In making its decision, the ACC determined that the current net metering program creates a cost shift, causing non-solar utility customers to pay higher rates to cover the costs of maintaining the electric grid.  The ACC acknowledged that the $0.70 per kilowatt charge addresses only a portion of the cost shift.

On October 20, 2015, the ACC voted to conduct a generic evidentiary hearing on the value and cost of distributed generation to gather information that will inform the ACC on net metering issues and cost of service studies in upcoming utility rate cases.  A hearing was held in April 2016.   On October 7, 2016, an Administrative Law Judge (the "ALJ") issued a recommendation in the docket concerning the value and cost of distributed generation. The ALJ recommended a change to how customers are compensated for energy that they export from rooftop solar systems. Instead of retail rate net metering, the ALJ recommended that the amount of compensation be established by using both an avoided cost calculation and a grid-scale solar resource proxy calculation that would be updated in subsequent utility rate cases. The ALJ recommended that the change to how APS pays for exported rooftop solar energy apply only to those customers who apply to interconnect their distributed generation systems after a decision in APS s currently pending rate case. The ALJ found rooftop solar customers to be partial requirements customers, but recommended that whether rooftop solar customers should be placed into a separate customer class for purposes of ratemaking be decided in individual utility rate cases.  Exceptions to the ALJ recommendation are due November 15, 2016.  On December 13, 2016, the ACC will discuss at an opening meeting the ALJ recommendation concerning the value and cost of distributed generation.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. 
    
  In 2015, Arizona jurisdictional utilities UNS Electric, Inc. and Tucson Electric Power Company ("TEP") both filed applications with the ACC requesting rate increases. These applications include rate design changes to mitigate the cost shift caused by net metering. On December 9, 2015 and February 23, 2016, APS filed testimony in the UNS Electric, Inc. rate case in  support of the UNS Electric, Inc. proposed rate design changes. APS actively participated in the related hearings held in March 2016. On August 18, 2016, the ACC issued a decision which ordered that net metering be considered in a separate, phase 2 of the UNS Electric, Inc. rate case to occur after the ACC decides issues raised in the separate, generic docket concerning the value and cost of distributed generation discussed above. APS has also intervened in the upcoming TEP rate case. On June 24, 2016, APS filed testimony in the TEP rate case in support of the TEP proposed rate design changes. In August 2016, the ACC also bifurcated the TEP rate case into two phases, the first of which will address revenue requirements and other traditional rate case issues while the second will address net metering issues. The outcomes of these proceedings will not directly impact our financial position. 
    
  Appellate Review of Third-Party Regulatory Decision ("System Improvement Benefits" or "SIB").      In a recent appellate challenge to an ACC rate decision involving a water company, the Arizona Court of Appeals considered the question of how the ACC should determine the  fair value  of a utility s property, as specified in the Arizona Constitution, in connection with authorizing the recovery of costs through rate adjustors outside of a rate case.  The Court of Appeals reversed the ACC s method of finding fair value in that case, and raised questions concerning the relationship between the need for fair value findings and the recovery of capital and certain other utility costs through adjustors. The ACC sought review by the Arizona Supreme Court of this decision, and APS filed a brief supporting the ACC s petition to the Arizona Supreme Court for review of the Court of Appeals  decision.  On February 9, 2016, the Arizona Supreme Court granted review of the decision and on August 8, 2016, the Arizona Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals opinion and affirmed the ACC s orders approving the water company s SIB adjustor. 
    
  System Benefits Charge.    The 2012 Settlement Agreement  provides that once APS achieved full funding of its decommissioning obligation under the sale leaseback agreements covering Unit 2 of Palo Verde, APS was required to implement a reduced System Benefits charge effective January 1, 2016.  Beginning on January 1, 2016, APS began implementing a reduced System Benefits charge.  The impact on APS retail revenues from the new System Benefits charge is an overall reduction of approximately $14.6 million per year with a corresponding reduction in depreciation and amortization expense. 
    
    Subpoena from Arizona Corporation Commissioner Robert Burns.     On August 25, 2016, Commissioner Burns, individually and not by action of the ACC as a whole, filed subpoenas in APS s current  
  
   63 

retail rate proceeding to APS and Pinnacle West for the production of records and information relating to a range of expenditures from 2011 through year-to-date 2016. The subpoenas request information concerning marketing and advertising expenditures, charitable donations, lobbying expenses, contributions to 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) nonprofits and political contributions.  The return date for the production of information was set as September 15, 2016. The subpoenas also sought testimony from company personnel having knowledge of the material, including the Chief Executive Officer, on October 6, 2016.  
    
  On September 9, 2016, APS filed with the ACC a motion to quash the subpoenas, or alternatively stay APS  obligations to comply with the subpoenas and decline to decide APS  motion pending court proceedings. Contemporaneously with the filing of this motion, APS and Pinnacle West filed a complaint for special action and declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of Arizona for Maricopa County, seeking a declaratory judgment that Commissioner Burns  subpoenas are contrary to law.  On September 15, 2016, APS produced all non-confidential and responsive documents and offered to produce any remaining responsive documents that are confidential after an appropriate confidentiality agreement is signed. APS and Pinnacle West cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
    
  Financial Strength and Flexibility.    Pinnacle West and APS currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities, and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company.  Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock. 
    
  Other Subsidiaries. 
    
  Bright Canyon Energy.    On July 31, 2014, Pinnacle West announced its creation of a wholly-owned subsidiary, BCE.  BCE will focus on new growth opportunities that leverage the Company s core expertise in the electric energy industry.  BCE s first initiative is a 50/50 joint venture with BHE U.S. Transmission LLC, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  The joint venture, named TransCanyon, is pursuing independent transmission opportunities within the eleven states that comprise the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be provided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners  utility affiliates.  TransCanyon continues to pursue transmission development opportunities in the western United States consistent with its strategy.  
    
  On March 29, 2016, TransCanyon entered into a strategic alliance agreement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company ("PG E") to jointly pursue competitive transmission opportunities solicited by the CAISO, the operator for the majority of California's transmission grid.  TransCanyon and PG E intend to jointly engage in the development of future transmission infrastructure and compete to develop, build, own and operate transmission projects approved by the CAISO. 
    
    El Dorado.    The operations of El Dorado are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results, or to require any material amounts of capital, over the next three years. 
    
    4CA.    See "Four Corners - Asset Purchase Agreement and Coal Supply Matters" above for information regarding 4CA.

Key Financial Drivers 
    
  In addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above, many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook, including those listed below.  We closely monitor these factors to plan for the Company s current needs, and to adjust our expectations, financial budgets and forecasts appropriately. 
    
  Electric Operating Revenues.    For the years 2013 through 2015, retail electric revenues comprised approximately 93% of our total electric operating revenues.  Our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline, variations in weather from period to period, customer mix, average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs, distributed energy additions, electricity rates and tariffs, and the operation of our adjustor mechanisms.  These revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions, including competition, demand and prices. 
    
  Customer and Sales Growth.    Retail customers in APS s service territory increased 1.4% for the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period.  For the three years 2013 through 2015, APS s customer growth averaged 1.3% per year.  We currently expect annual customer growth to average in the range of 2.0-3.0% for 2016 through 2018 based on our assessment of modestly improving economic conditions in Arizona.  Retail electricity sales in kWh, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, increased 0.3% for the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period, reflecting the effects of improving economic conditions and customer growth and an additional day of sales due to the leap year, partially offset by customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives.  For the three years 2013 through 2015, APS experienced annual increases in retail electricity sales averaging 0.1%, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations.  We currently estimate that annual retail electricity sales in kWh will increase on average in the range of 0.5-1.5% during 2016 through 2018, including the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives, but excluding the effects of weather variations.  A slower recovery of the Arizona economy could further impact these estimates. 
    
  Actual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and energy conservation, impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in distributed generation, and responses to retail price changes.  Based on past experience, a reasonable range of variation in our kWh sales projections attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to $10 million. 
    
  Weather and Seasonality.    In forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above, we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data.  Historically, extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of $20 million.  However, our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to $10 million.  Additionally, amounts reported in our interim Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income are not necessarily indicative of amounts expected for the respective annual periods, due to the effects of seasonal temperature variations on energy consumption. 
    
  Fuel and Purchased Power Costs.    Fuel and purchased power costs included on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel, our power plant performance, transmission availability or constraints, prevailing market prices, new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas, changes in our generation resource allocation, our hedging program for managing such costs and PSA deferrals and the related amortization. 
  
   65 

Operations and Maintenance Expenses  .    Operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth, power plant operations, maintenance of utility plant (including generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), inflation, outages, renewable energy and demand side management related expenses (which are offset by the same amount of operating revenues) and other factors. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expenses.    Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property (such as new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), and changes in depreciation and amortization rates.  See "Capital Expenditures" below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities.  See Note   3   regarding deferral of certain costs pursuant to an ACC order. 
    
  Property Taxes.    Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are affected by the value of property in-service and under construction, assessment ratios, and tax rates.  The average property tax rate in Arizona for APS, which owns essentially all of our property, was 11.0% of the assessed value for 2015, 10.7% for 2014 and 10.5% for 2013.  We expect property taxes to increase as we add new generating units and continue with improvements and expansions to our existing generating units, transmission and distribution facilities.  (See Note   3   for property tax deferrals contained in the 2012 Settlement Agreement.) 
    
  Income Taxes  .    Income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income, income tax rates, certain deductions and non-taxable items, such as AFUDC.  In addition, income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities. 
    
  Interest Expense.    Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt (see Note   2  ).  The primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities, equity issuances and internally generated cash flow.  An allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction.  We stop accruing AFUDC on a project when it is placed in commercial operation. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Pinnacle West s only reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily retail and wholesale sales supplied to traditional cost-based rate regulation ("Native Load") customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission and distribution. 
    
  Operating Results       Three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared with three-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $263 million  , compared with consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of   $257 million   for the prior-year period.  The results reflect an increase of approximately $6 million for the regulated electricity segment primarily due to lower operations and maintenance expenses and higher lost fixed cost recovery revenues, partially offset by the effects of milder weather.

The following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders by business segment compared with the prior-year period: 

Operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses.    Regulated electricity segment operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were $8 million lower for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period.

Operations and maintenance  .  Operations and maintenance expenses decreased $5 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period primarily because of: 

A decrease of $4 million related to lower fossil operating costs; 

A decrease of $4 million for employee benefit costs primarily related to decreased stock compensation partially offset by other benefit costs; 

A decrease of $4 million related to costs for demand-side management, renewable energy and similar regulatory programs, which is offset in operating revenues and purchased power; 

An increase of $2 million for corporate support costs primarily related to outside legal services; and 

An increase of $5 million related to miscellaneous other factors. 
       
  Depreciation and amortization.    Depreciation and amortization expenses were $6 million lower for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period primarily related to: 

A decrease of $5 million related to the regulatory treatment of the Palo Verde sale leaseback lease extension; 

A decrease of $4 million due to lower Palo Verde decommissioning expense recovered through the system benefits charge (offset in operating revenues); and 

An increase of $3 million due to increased plant in service. 
       
    Operating Results       Nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared with nine-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $389 million  , compared with consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of   $396 million   for the prior-year period.  The results reflect a decrease of approximately $7 million for the regulated electricity segment primarily due to higher operations and maintenance expenses related to employee benefit costs, transmission, distribution and customer service costs and fossil generation costs partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues, higher retail sales due to customer growth and changes in customer usage patterns and related pricing and higher lost fixed cost recovery revenues.

Operations and maintenance  .  Operations and maintenance expenses increased $55 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period primarily because of: 

An increase of $22 million for employee benefit costs primarily related to increased stock compensation and other benefit costs;  

An increase of $12 million for transmission, distribution, and customer service costs primarily related to increased maintenance costs;  

An increase of $11 million in fossil generation costs primarily related to $32 million in higher planned outage costs, partially offset by $21 million of lower other fossil operating costs; 

A decrease of $9 million related to costs for demand-side management, renewable energy and similar regulatory programs, which is partially offset in operating revenues and purchased power; 

An increase of $5 million for costs to support the company's positions on a solar net metering ballot initiative in Arizona, and increased regulatory costs;  

An increase of $6 million for costs related to corporate support;  

An increase of $4 million related to higher nuclear generation costs; and 

An increase of $4 million related to miscellaneous other factors. 
       
  Depreciation and amortization.    Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $7 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the prior-year period primarily related to: 

A decrease of $15 million related to the regulatory treatment of the Palo Verde sale leaseback lease extension; 

A decrease of $11 million due to lower Palo Verde decommissioning expense recovered through the system benefits charge (offset in operating revenues); and 

An increase of $19 million due to increased plant in service. 
       
  All other income and expenses, net.    All other income and expenses, net, were $11 million higher for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period primarily due to the gain on sale of a transmission line and higher allowance for equity funds used during construction. 
    
  Interest charges, net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction  .    Interest charges, net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction, increased $6 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period, primarily because of higher debt balances in the current year. 
    
  Income Taxes  .    Income taxes were $6 million lower for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period, primarily because of lower taxable income in the current year.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Overview 
    
  Pinnacle West s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.  The level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our Board of Directors and based on a number of factors, including our financial condition, payout ratio, free cash flow and other factors. 
    
  Our primary sources of cash are dividends from APS and external debt and equity issuances.  An ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40%.  As defined in the related ACC order, the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt.  At   September 30, 2016  , APS s common equity ratio, as defined, was 54%.  Its total shareholder equity was approximately   $4.9 billion  , and total capitalization was approximately   $9.2 billion  .  Under this order, APS would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately   $3.7 billion  , assuming APS s total capitalization remains the same.  This restriction does not materially affect Pinnacle West s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders. 
    
  APS s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt.  APS funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, external debt financing and equity infusions from Pinnacle West. 
    
  Many of APS s current capital expenditure projects qualify for bonus depreciation.  On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (H.R. 2029), which combined the tax and government funding bills (The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act and Omnibus Bill) containing an extension of bonus depreciation through 2019.  Enactment of this legislation is expected to generate approximately $375-$425 million of cash tax benefits over the next three years, which is expected to be fully realized by APS and Pinnacle West Consolidated during this time frame.  The cash generated by the extension of bonus depreciation is an acceleration of the tax benefits that APS would have otherwise received over 20 years and reduces rate base for ratemaking purposes.  At Pinnacle West Consolidated, the extension of bonus depreciation will, in turn, delay until 2019 full cash realization of approximately $61 million of currently unrealized Investment Tax Credits, which are recorded as a deferred tax asset on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Summary of Cash Flows 
    
  The following tables present net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 (dollars in millions): 
    
  Pinnacle West Consolidated

Arizona Public Service Company 

Operating Cash Flows 
    
  Nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared with nine-month period ended   September 30, 2015  .    Pinnacle West s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was $765 million in 2016 compared to $821 million in 2015. The decrease of $56 million in net cash provided is primarily due to  higher operating costs.   
    
  Retirement plans and other postretirement benefits.    Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries.  The requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan.  We contribute at least the minimum amount required under ERISA regulations, but no more than the maximum tax-deductible amount.  The minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension benefit obligations.  Under ERISA, the qualified pension plan was 116% funded as of January 1, 2015 and 2016.  Under GAAP, the qualified pension plan was 89% funded as of January 1, 2015 and 88% funded as of January 1, 2016.  The assets in the plan are comprised of fixed-income, equity, real estate, and short-term investments.  Future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions.  We have made voluntary contributions of $100 million to our pension plan year-to-date in 2016.  The minimum required contributions for the pension plan are zero for the next three years.  We expect to make voluntary contributions up to a total of $300 million during the 2016-2018 period.  We expect to make contributions of approximately $1 million in each of the next three years to our other postretirement benefit plans. 
    
  Investing Cash Flows 
    
  Nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared with nine-month period ended   September 30, 2015  .    Pinnacle West s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was $1,010 million in 2016, compared to $773 million in 2015, an increase of $237 million in net cash used primarily related to increased capital expenditures. 

72 

Capital Expenditures.    The following table summarizes the estimated capital expenditures for the next three years: 
    
  Capital Expenditures 
  (dollars in millions) 

(a)             Primarily information systems and facilities projects. 
    
  Generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to APS s existing fossil, renewable and nuclear plants.  Examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions, upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment, such as turbines, boilers and environmental equipment.  The estimated renewables capital expenditures include a grid scale solar facility.  We have not included estimated costs for Cholla's compliance with EPA s regional haze rule since we have challenged the regional haze rule judicially and we have proposed a compromise strategy to EPA, which, if approved, would allow us to avoid expenditures related to environmental control equipment.  We are monitoring the status of other environmental matters, which, depending on their final outcome, could require modification to our planned environmental expenditures.  
    
  On February 17, 2015, APS and El Paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by APS, or an affiliate of APS, of El Paso s 7% interest in each of Units 4 and 5 of Four Corners.  On December 29, 2015, NTEC notified APS of its intent to exercise its option to purchase the 7% interest.  4CA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West, purchased the El Paso interest on July 6, 2016.  The table above does not include capital expenditures related to 4CA's interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5 of approximately $30 million in 2016 and $27 million in 2017. 
    
  Distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades, capital replacements, and new customer construction.  Examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines, substations, and line extensions to new residential and commercial developments. 
    
  Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock. 

73 

Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity 
    
  Nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared with nine-month period ended   September 30, 2015  .    Pinnacle West s consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was $254 million in 2016, compared to $43 million of net cash used for financing activities in 2015, an increase of $297 million in net cash provided.  The increase in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to a $208 million net increase in short-term borrowings and $93 million higher issuances of long-term debt through September 30, 2016. 
    
  Significant Financing Activities.    On October 20, 2016, the Pinnacle West Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.655 per share of common stock, payable on December 1, 2016 to shareholders of record on November 1, 2016.  This represents an increase in the indicated annual dividend from $2.50 per share to $2.62 per share.   
    
  On April 22, 2016, APS entered into a   $100 million   term loan facility that matures April 22, 2019. Interest rates are based on APS's senior unsecured debt credit ratings. APS used the proceeds to repay and refinance existing short-term indebtedness. 
    
  On May 6, 2016, APS issued   $350 million   of   3.75%   unsecured senior notes that mature on May 15, 2046. The net proceeds from the sale were used to   redeem and cancel   Pollution Control Bonds (see details below), and to repay commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. 
    
  On June 1, 2016, APS redeemed at par and canceled all   $64 million   of the Navajo County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation Revenue Refunding Bonds (Arizona Public Service Company Cholla Project), 2009 Series D and E. 
    
  On June 1, 2016, APS redeemed at par and canceled all   $13 million   of the Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation Revenue Refunding Bonds (Arizona Public Service Company Navajo Project), 2009 Series A. 
    
  On August 1, 2016, APS repaid at maturity APS s   $250 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.25%   senior notes due August 1, 2016. 
    
  On September 20, 2016, APS issued   $250 million   of   2.55%   unsecured senior notes that mature on September 15, 2026. The net proceeds from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used in connection with the payment at maturity of our   $250 million   aggregate principal amount of   6.25%   Notes due August 1, 2016. 
    
  On September 20, 2016, APS redeemed at par and canceled all   $27 million   of the Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation Revenue Refunding Bonds (Arizona Public Service Company Navajo Project), 2009 Series B. 
    
  Available Credit Facilities  .    Pinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide credit support for their commercial paper programs. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, APS increased its commercial paper program from   $250 million   to   $500 million  . 
    
  On May 13, 2016, Pinnacle West replaced its   $200 million   revolving credit facility that would have matured in May 2019, with a new   $200 million   facility that matures in May 2021. Pinnacle West has the option  
  
   74 

to increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum of   $300 million   upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders. At   September 30, 2016  , Pinnacle West had   no   outstanding borrowings under its credit facility,   no   letters of credit outstanding and   no   commercial paper borrowings. 
    
  On May 13, 2016, APS replaced its   $500 million   revolving credit facility that would have matured in May 2019, with a new   $500 million   facility that matures in May 2021.   
    
  On August 31, 2016, PNW entered into a   $75 million   364-day unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in August 2017. PNW will use the new facility to fund or otherwise support obligations related to 4CA, and borrowings under the facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.80% per annum. At September 30, 2016, Pinnacle West had   $34 million   outstanding under the facility. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , APS had   two   revolving credit facilities totaling   $1 billion  , including a   $500 million   credit facility that matures in September 2020 and the   $500 million   facility that matures in May 2021.  APS may increase the amount of each facility up to a maximum of   $700 million  , for a total of   $1.4 billion  , upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders.  Interest rates are based on APS s senior unsecured debt credit ratings.  These facilities are available to support APS s   $500 million   commercial paper program, for bank borrowings or for issuances of letters of credit.  At   September 30, 2016  , APS had   $83 million   of commercial paper outstanding and   no   outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under its revolving credit facilities. 
    
   See "Financial Assurances" in Note   7   for a discussion of APS s separate outstanding letters of credit. 
    
  Other Financing Matters.    See Note   6   for information related to the change in our margin and collateral accounts. 
    
  Debt Provisions 
    
  Pinnacle West s and APS s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios.  Pinnacle West and APS comply with this covenant.  For both Pinnacle West and APS, this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%.  At   September 30, 2016  , the ratio was approximately 48% for Pinnacle West and 47% for APS.  Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could "cross-default" other debt.  See further discussion of "cross-default" provisions below. 
    
  Neither Pinnacle West s nor APS s financing agreements contain "rating triggers" that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade.  However, our bank credit agreements and term loan facilities contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings. 
    
  All of Pinnacle West s loan agreements contain "cross-default" provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  All of APS s bank agreements contain "cross-default" provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings. 
    
  See Note   2   for further discussions of liquidity matters. 

75 

Credit Ratings 
    
  The ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of October 28, 2016 are shown below.  We are disclosing these credit ratings to enhance understanding of our cost of short-term and long-term capital and our ability to access the markets for liquidity and long-term debt.  The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained.  There is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time.  The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.  Any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West s or APS s securities and/or result in an increase in the cost of, or limit access to, capital.  Such revisions may also result in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments, insurance policies, natural gas transportation, fuel supply, and other energy-related contracts.  At this time, we believe we have sufficient available liquidity resources to respond to a downward revision to our credit ratings.

  Contractual Obligations 
    
  There have been no material changes, as of September 30, 2016, outside the normal course of business in contractual obligations from the information provided in our 2015 Form 10-K.  See Note 2 for discussion regarding changes in our long-term debt obligations. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  In preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period.  Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates.  There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies since our 2015 Form 10-K.  See "Critical Accounting Policies" in Item 7 of the 2015 Form 10-K for further details about our critical accounting policies. 

76 

OTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS 
    
  We are currently evaluating the impacts of adopting the following new accounting standards: 
             
    Stock compensation guidance effective for us January 1, 2017 
                
    Revenue recognition guidance, and related amendments, effective for us January 1, 2018 
                
    Financial instrument recognition and measurement guidance effective for us January 1, 2018

  See Note   12   for additional information related to accounting matters. 

MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS 
    
  Market Risks 
    
  Our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund and benefit plan assets. 
    
  Interest Rate and Equity Risk 
    
  We have exposure to changing interest rates.  Changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable-rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund (see Note   10   and Note   11  ) and benefit plan assets.  The nuclear decommissioning trust fund and benefit plan assets also have risks associated with the changing market value of their equity and other non-fixed income investments.  Nuclear decommissioning and benefit plan costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices. 
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas.  Our risk management committee, consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees company-wide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies.  We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that may qualify as derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps.  As part of our risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities. 

77 

The following table shows the net pretax changes in mark-to-market of our derivative positions for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in millions): 

The table below shows the fair value of maturities of our derivative contracts (dollars in millions) at   September 30, 2016   by maturities and by the type of valuation that is performed to calculate the fair values, classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  See Note   1  , "Derivative Accounting" and "Fair Value Measurements," in Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K and Note   10   for more discussion of our valuation methods. 

The table below shows the impact that hypothetical price movements of 10% would have on the market value of our risk management assets and liabilities included on Pinnacle West s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in millions): 

(a) 
    These contracts are economic hedges of our forecasted purchases of natural gas and electricity.  The impact of these hypothetical price movements would substantially offset the impact that these same price movements would have on the physical exposures being hedged.  To the extent the amounts are eligible for inclusion in the PSA, the amounts are recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability. 

78 

Credit Risk 
    
  We are exposed to losses in the event of non-performance or non-payment by counterparties.  See Note   6   for a discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy. 

Item 3.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  See "Key Financial Drivers" and "Market and Credit Risks" in Item 2 above for a discussion of quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks. 

Item 4.         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  (a)                                     Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The term "disclosure controls and procedures" means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (15 U.S.C. 78a   et seq  .), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Pinnacle West s management, with the participation of Pinnacle West s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of Pinnacle West s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on that evaluation, Pinnacle West s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of that date, Pinnacle West s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  APS s management, with the participation of APS s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of APS s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on that evaluation, APS s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of that date, APS s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  (b)                                     Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  The term "internal control over financial reporting" (defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(f)) refers to the process of a company that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  No change in Pinnacle West s or APS s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Pinnacle West s or APS s internal control over financial reporting. 

79 

PART II -- OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.                   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  See "Business of Arizona Public Service Company   Environmental Matters" in Item 1 of the 2015 Form 10-K with regard to pending or threatened litigation and other disputes. 
    
  See Note   3   for ACC and FERC-related matters. 
    
  See Note   7   for information regarding environmental matters and Superfund-related matters. 

Item 1A.                RISK FACTORS 
    
  In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A   Risk Factors in the 2015 Form 10-K, which could materially affect the business, financial condition, cash flows or future results of Pinnacle West and APS.  The risks described in the 2015 Form 10-K are not the only risks facing Pinnacle West and APS.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, cash flows and/or operating results of Pinnacle West and APS.  

Item 5.                OTHER INFORMATION 
    
  Peabody Bankruptcy 
    
  On April 13, 2016, Peabody Energy Corporation and certain affiliated entities filed a petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.  Under a Coal Supply Agreement, dated December 21, 2005, Peabody supplied coal to APS and PacifiCorp (collectively, the  Buyers ) for use at the Cholla power plant in Arizona.  APS believes that the Coal Supply Agreement terminated automatically on April 13, 2016 as a result of Peabody's bankruptcy filing.  The Buyers filed a motion requesting that the Bankruptcy Court enter an order determining that the Buyers are authorized to enforce the termination provisions in the Coal Supply Agreement.  
    
  On May 13, 2016, Peabody filed a complaint against the Buyers in the bankruptcy court in which Peabody alleges that the Buyers have breached the Agreement. Peabody requests substantial, but unspecified, monetary damages from the Buyers.  Peabody and the Buyers have agreed to pursue non-binding mediation, failing which a trial is expected to begin in February 2017.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. 
    
  Subpoenas 
    
  Pinnacle West has received grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with an investigation by the office of the United States Attorney for the District of Arizona.  The subpoenas seek information principally pertaining to the 2014 statewide election races in Arizona for Secretary of State and for positions on the ACC.  The subpoenas request records involving certain Pinnacle West officers and employees, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer, as well as communications between Pinnacle West personnel and a former ACC Commissioner.  Pinnacle West is cooperating fully with the United States Attorney s office in this matter.

  (b)      Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit  .

Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any L/C Related Documents, as the applicable Issuing Bank or the Agent may require.  In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Application or other L/C Related Document shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.  Without limitation of the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent that any such Letter of Credit Application or other L/C Related Document shall impose any additional conditions on the maintenance of a Letter of Credit, any additional default provisions, collateral requirements or other obligations of the Borrower to any Issuing Bank, other than as stated in this Agreement, such additional conditions, provisions, requirements or other obligations shall not have effect so long as this Agreement shall be in effect, except to the extent as expressly agreed to by the Borrower and such Issuing Bank. The Borrower unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that, in connection with any Letter of Credit issued for the support of any Subsidiary s obligations as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph, the Borrower will be fully responsible for the reimbursement of all L/C Obligations in accordance with the terms hereof, the payment of interest thereon and the payment of fees due hereunder to the same extent as if it were the sole account party in respect of such Letter of Credit (the Borrower hereby irrevocably waiving any defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of the obligations of such a Subsidiary that is an account party in respect of any such Letter of Credit). 
  (ii)    Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the applicable Issuing Bank will confirm with the Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, such Issuing Bank will provide the Agent with a copy thereof.  Unless the applicable Issuing Bank has received written notice from the Required Lenders, the Agent or the Borrower, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in   Article III   shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof and any applicable Letter of Credit Application, such Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with such Issuing Bank s usual and customary business practices.  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from such Issuing Bank a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender s Ratable Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
  (iii)    If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an    Auto-Extension Letter of Credit      provided   that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit such Issuing Bank to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the    Non-Extension Notice Date   ) in each such twelve-month  
  
   23 

period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued.  Unless otherwise directed by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the applicable Issuing Bank for any such extension.  Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable Issuing Bank to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;   provided  ,   however  , that the applicable Issuing Bank shall not permit any such extension (or may issue a Notice of Non-Extension) if (A) such Issuing Bank has determined that it would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) by reason of the provisions of clause (i) of   Section 2.03(a)   (or would have no obligation to issue such Letter of Credit by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) of   Section 2.03(a)  ), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension pursuant to   Section 6.02   or (2) from the Agent, the Required Lenders or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in   Section 3.02   is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such Issuing Bank not to permit such extension. 
  (iv)    Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Borrower and the Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
  (c)      Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations  . 
  (i)    Subject to the provisions below, not later than 2:30 p.m. on the date (the    Honor Date   ) that any Issuing Bank makes any payment on a drawing on any Letter of Credit, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such payment prior to 11:30 a.m. on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 2:30 p.m. on the next Business Day, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank through the Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing together with interest thereon.  If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such Issuing Bank by such time, unless the Borrower shall have advised the Agent that it does not meet the conditions specified in clause (B) below, the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the    Unreimbursed Amount   ), and the amount of such Lender s Ratable Share thereof.  In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Base Rate Advance to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in   Section 2.01(a)   or the delivery of a Notice of Borrowing but subject to (A) the amount of the aggregate Unused Commitments and (B) no Event of Default having occurred and be continuing, or resulting therefrom and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to satisfy the reimbursement obligation created by such payment by the Issuing Bank on the Honor Date shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Base Rate Advance.  Any notice given by any Issuing Bank or the Agent pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c)(i)   may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing;   provided   that the lack of such  
  
   24 

an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.   
  (ii)    Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to   Section 2.03(c)(i)   make funds available to the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank at the Agent s Office in an amount equal to its Ratable Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 4:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of   Section 2.03(c)(iii)  , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Advance to the Borrower in such amount.  The Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable Issuing Bank. 
  (iii)    With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Base Rate Advance because any of the conditions set forth in clauses (A) or (B) of   Section 2.03(c)(i)   cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, then not later than 2:30 p.m. on the next Business Day after the day notice of the drawing is given to the Borrower, in the case of a failure to meet any such condition, or in any other case, after notice of the event resulting in the outstanding Unreimbursed Amount, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank through the Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such outstanding Unreimbursed Amount with interest thereon.  If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such Issuing Bank by such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable Issuing Bank an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Advances in effect from time to time plus 2% per annum.  In such event, each Lender s payment to the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank pursuant to   Section 2.03(c)(ii)   shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this   Section 2.03  . 
  (iv)    Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Advance or L/C Advance pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c)   to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Ratable Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank. 
  (v)    Each Lender s obligation to make Base Rate Advances or L/C Advances to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this   Section 2.03(c)  , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against such Issuing Bank, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;   provided  ,   however  , that each Lender s obligation to make Base Rate Advances pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c)   is subject to the conditions set forth in   Section 2.03(c)(i)  .  No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower  
  
   25 

to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
  (vi)    If any Lender fails to make available to the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.03(c)   by the time specified in   Section 2.03(c)(ii)  , such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by such Issuing Bank in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such Issuing Bank in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Base Rate Advance included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be.  A certificate of the applicable Issuing Bank submitted to any Lender (through the Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (d)      Repayment of Participations  . 
  (i)    At any time after the applicable Issuing Bank has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with   Section 2.03(c)  , if the Agent receives for the account of such Issuing Bank any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral (as defined in   Section 2.03(h)  ) applied thereto by the Agent), the Agent will distribute to such Lender its Ratable Share thereof in the same funds as those received by the Agent. 
  (ii)    If any payment received by the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank pursuant to   Section 2.03(c)(i)   is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in   Section 8.12   (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Issuing Bank in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank its Ratable Share thereof on demand of the Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
  (e)      Failure to Make Revolving Advances  .  The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Advance to be made by it on the date specified in   Section 2.03(c)   or any L/C Advance shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its Revolving Advance or L/C Advance, as the case may be, to be made by such other Lender on such date. 
  
   26 

(f)      Obligations Absolute  .  The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 
  (i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; 
  (ii)    the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
  (iii)    any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;  
  (iv)    any payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the applicable Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or 
  (v)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower. 
  provided  ,   however  , that nothing in this   Section 2.03(f)   shall limit the rights of the Borrower under   Section 2.03(g)  . 
  The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower s instructions or other irregularity that is known to the Borrower in connection with any draw under such Letter of Credit of which the Borrower has reasonable notice, the Borrower will immediately notify the applicable Issuing Bank.  To the extent allowed by applicable Law, Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the applicable Issuing Bank and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.  Nothing herein shall require the Borrower to make any determination as to whether the drawing is in accordance with the requirements of the Letter of Credit, provided that the Borrower may waive any discrepancies in the drawing on any such Letter of Credit. 
  
   27 

(g)      Role of Issuing Bank  .  Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.  None of the applicable Issuing Bank, the Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of such Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or L/C Related Document.  The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;   provided  ,   however  , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at Law or under any other agreement.  None of the applicable Issuing Bank, the Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of such Issuing Bank shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of   Section 2.03(f)  ;   provided  ,   however  , that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the applicable Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by such Issuing Bank s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such Issuing Bank s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the applicable Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on its face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and such Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
  (h)      Cash Collateral  .  Upon the request of the Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank, if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then outstanding L/C Obligations.    Section 6.02   sets forth certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder.  For purposes of this   Section 2.03  ,   Section 2.10(b)(ii)  ,   Section 2.19(c)   (  ii  ), (  iv  ) and (  v  ) and   Section 6.02  ,  Cash Collateralize  means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent and each Issuing Bank (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders) in an amount equal to 100% of the amount of the L/C Obligations as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest and fees thereon.  Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings.  The Borrower hereby grants to the Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.  Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts with the Agent.

Each Swingline Advance shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the earlier of (x) on or before the fourteenth (14   th   ) Business Day after the date such Swingline Advance was made by the Swingline Lender or (y) the Termination Date.  A Swingline Advance may not be repaid with the proceeds from another Swingline Advance.  In addition, the Swingline Lender (i) may at any time in its sole discretion with respect to any outstanding Swingline Advance, or (ii) shall, on the fourteenth (14   th   ) Business Day after the date any Swingline Advance is made and which has not been otherwise repaid, require each Lender (including the Swingline Lender) to make a Revolving Advance in the amount of such Lender s Ratable Share of such Swingline Advance (including, without limitation, any interest accrued and unpaid thereon), for the purpose of repaying such Swingline Advance.  Not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date of any notice received pursuant to this   Section 2.03A(c)  , each Lender shall make available to the Agent its required Revolving Advance, in immediately available funds in the same manner as provided in   Section 2.02(a)   with respect to Revolving Advances made by such Lender.

Each Lender s obligation to make Revolving Advances pursuant to this   Section 2.03A(c)   to repay Swingline Advances shall be unconditional, continuing, irrevocable and absolute and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, (a) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Agent, the Swingline Lender or any other Person, (b) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, (c) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, or (d) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever.

In addition to the foregoing, if for any reason any Lender fails to make payment to the Agent of any amount due under this   Section 2.03A(c)  , such Lender shall be deemed, at the option of the Agent, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the Swingline Lender without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the applicable Swingline Advance in the amount of such Revolving Advance, and such interest and participation may be recovered from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day during the period commencing on the date of demand and ending on the date such amount is received.

Swingline Lender and the due date for the repayment of such Swingline Advances; provided that if no Swingline Advances are outstanding, no such report shall be required to be delivered. 
  (e)      Successor Swingline Lender  .  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Swingline Lender as provided in this paragraph, the Borrower may, upon not less than ten (10) Business Days prior notice to the Agent and the Lenders, replace the existing Swingline Lender with the consent of the Agent (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld).  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Swingline Lender hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the replaced Swingline Lender, and the replaced Swingline Lender shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Swingline Lender shall be as agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the Swingline Lender s replacement hereunder, the provisions of this   Article   and   Section 8.04   shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Swingline Lender.

  (b)    So long as no Default or Event of Default shall be continuing, the Borrower shall have the right, at any time, upon at least ten Business Days  notice to an Affected Lender (with a copy to the Agent), to terminate in whole such Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment and, if applicable, its Letter of Credit Commitment, without affecting the Commitments of any other Lender.

Upon termination of a Lender s Commitments under this   Section 2.05(b)  , the Borrower will pay or cause to be paid all principal of, and interest accrued to the date of such payment on, Revolving Advances (and if such Lender is the Swingline Lender, the Swingline Advances) owing to such Lender and, subject to   Section 2.19  , pay any accrued commitment fees or Letter of Credit fees payable to such Lender pursuant to the provisions of   Section 2.04  , and all other amounts payable to such Lender hereunder (including, but not limited to, any increased costs or other amounts owing under   Section 2.11   and any indemnification for Taxes under   Section 2.14  ); and, if such Lender is an Issuing Bank, shall pay to such Issuing Bank for deposit in an escrow account an amount equal to the Available Amount of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, whereupon all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have been issued outside of this Agreement on a bilateral basis and shall cease for all purposes to constitute a Letter of Credit issued under this Agreement, and upon such payments, except as otherwise provided below, the obligations of such Lender hereunder shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged;   provided  ,   however  , that (i) such Lender s rights under   Section 2.11  ,   Section 2.14   and   Section 8.04  , and, in the case of an Issuing Bank,   Section 8.04(c)  , and its obligations under   Section 8.04   and   8.08  , in each case in accordance with the terms thereof, shall survive such release and discharge as to matters occurring prior to such date and (ii) such escrow agreement shall be in a form reasonably agreed to by the Borrower and such Issuing Bank, but in

The aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders once reduced pursuant to this   Section 2.05(b)   may not be reinstated.  The termination of the Commitments of an Affected Lender pursuant to this   Section 2.05(b)   will not be deemed to be a waiver of any right that the Borrower, the Agent, any Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender or any other Lender may have against the Affected Lender that arose prior to the date of such termination.  Upon any such termination, the Ratable Share of each remaining Lender will be revised.

  (i)      Base Rate Advances  .  During such periods as such Revolving Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time   plus   (y) the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Advances in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December during such periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full. 
  (ii)      Eurodollar Rate Advances  .  During such periods as such Revolving Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Revolving Advance to the sum of (x) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Revolving Advance   plus   (y) the Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances in effect from time to time, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.  
  (iii)      Swingline Advances  .  During such period as such Swingline Advance remains outstanding, the Base Rate or, as agreed to by the Swingline Lender and the Borrower, the Money Market Rate or the Eurodollar Rate, payable on the date such Swingline Advance is required to be repaid.   
  (b)      Default Interest  .  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under   Section 6.01(a)  , the Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall, require the Borrower to pay interest (   Default Interest   ) on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each Lender, payable in arrears on the dates referred to in clause (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) above, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum

  (c)      Interest Rate Limitation  .  Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall be deemed to establish or require the payment of interest to any Lender at a rate in excess of the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law.  If the amount of interest payable for the account of any Lender on any interest payment date would exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable Law to be charged by such Lender, the amount of interest payable for its account on such interest payment date shall be automatically reduced to such maximum permissible amount.  In the event of any such reduction affecting any Lender, if from time to time thereafter the amount of interest payable for the account of such Lender on any interest payment date would be less than the maximum amount permitted by applicable Law to be charged by such Lender, then the amount of interest payable for its account on such subsequent interest payment date shall be automatically increased to such maximum permissible amount, provided that at no time shall the aggregate amount by which interest paid for the account of any Lender has been increased pursuant to this sentence exceed the aggregate amount by which interest paid for its account has theretofore been reduced pursuant to the previous sentence.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, Conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Advances or, failing that, will be deemed to have Converted such request into a request for a Base Rate Advance in the amount specified therein. 
  
   34 

(c)    If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of  Interest Period  in   Section 1.01  , the Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Revolving Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances. 
  (d)    On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, such Revolving Advances shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

  (i)    with respect to Eurodollar Rate Advances, each such Revolving Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance (or if such Revolving Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance); and 
  (ii)    the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to Convert Revolving Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

   35 

prepayment and the aggregate principal amount and Type of the Advance to be prepaid (and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Interest Period of the Borrowing pursuant to which made);   provided  ,   however  , that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the date of prepayment on the principal amount prepaid, and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to   Section 8.04(e)  .

  (ii)    impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Advances made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or 
  (iii)    subject the Agent or any Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Excluded Taxes and (C) Other Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; 
  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to the Agent or such Lender of making or maintaining any Advance (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Revolving Advance), or to increase the cost to the Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating

If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such Issuing Bank or any Applicable Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, regarding capital and liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Advances made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
  (c)      Certificates for Reimbursement  .  A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties absent manifest error.

   37 

equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Revolving Advance by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Eurodollar Rate Advance,   provided   the Borrower shall have received at least 30 days  prior notice (with a copy to the Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender.  If a Lender fails to give notice 30 days prior to the relevant interest payment date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 30 days from receipt of such notice. 
  Section 2.12      Illegality  .  If any Lender shall have determined in good faith that the introduction of or any change in any applicable Law or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance with any guideline or request from any such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), makes it unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Advances, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Advances or to Convert Base Rate Advances to Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay or, if applicable, Convert all Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender to Base Rate Advances, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Advances to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Advances.

Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
  (c)    Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fees or commissions, as the case may be;   provided  ,   however  , that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. 
  (d)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due to such Lender.  If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  (ii)    Each Lender and each Issuing Bank shall, within 30 days after demand therefor, severally (A) indemnify the Agent for (x) any Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes attributable to such Lender or such Issuing Bank (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so),  (y) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s failure to comply with the provisions of   Section 8.07(d)   relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) for any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority, and (B) indemnify the Borrower and the Agent against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements

   41 

as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and 
  (B)    each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Internal Revenue Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:

  (iii)    Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Applicable Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower or the Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. 
  
   42 

(iv)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (iv),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

If the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),   provided   that the Borrower, upon the request of the Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank in the event the Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This subsection shall not be construed to require the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
  (g)      Payments  .  Failure or delay on the part of the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.14   shall not constitute a waiver of the Agent s, such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation,   provided   that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate the Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.14   for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority more than three months prior to the date that the Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, claims compensation with respect thereto (except that, if a Change in Law giving rise to such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes is retroactive, then the three-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
  
   43 

(h)    Each of the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender agrees to cooperate with any reasonable request made by the Borrower in respect of a claim of a refund in respect of Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 2.14   if (i) the Borrower has agreed in writing to pay all of the Agent s or such Issuing Bank s or such Lender s reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to such claim, (ii) the Agent or such Issuing Bank or such Lender determines, in its good faith judgment, that it would not be disadvantaged, unduly burdened or prejudiced as a result of such claim and (iii) the Borrower furnishes, upon request of the Agent, or such Issuing Bank or such Lender, an opinion of tax counsel (such opinion, which can be reasoned, and such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to such Lender, or such Issuing Bank or the Agent) that the Borrower is likely to receive a refund or credit. 
  Section 2.15      Sharing of Payments, Etc  .

The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this   Section 2.15   may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
  Section 2.16      Evidence of Debt  . 
  (a)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of Advances.  The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender (including the Swingline Lender) to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note  
  
   44

  (c)    Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be   prima     facie   evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error;   provided  ,   however  , that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. 
  Section 2.17      Use of Proceeds  .  The proceeds of the Advances and issuances of Letters of Credit shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely to directly or indirectly fund or otherwise support 4C Sub or related obligations.   
  Section 2.18      Reserved  . 
  Section 2.19      Affected Lenders  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes an Affected Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is an Affected Lender: 
  (a)    fees shall cease to accrue on the Unused Commitment of such Affected Lender pursuant to   Section 2.04(a)  ; 
  (b)    the Revolving Credit Commitment and Advances of such Affected Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to   Section 8.01  ), other than any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or of each Lender affected; 
  (c)    if (x) there shall be any Available Amount under any outstanding Letter of Credit or (y) any Swingline Exposure shall exist during any time a Lender is an Affected Lender, then: 
  (i)    so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all or any part of the Available Amount of all such Letters of Credit and Swingline Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Affected Lenders in accordance with their respective  
  
   45 

Ratable Shares (disregarding any Affected Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment) but only to the extent that with respect to each non-Affected Lender the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Advances made by such non-Affected Lender (in its capacity as a Lender) and outstanding at such time plus (B) such non-Affected Lender s Ratable Share (after giving effect to the reallocation contemplated in this   Section 2.19(c)(i)  ) of the outstanding L/C Obligations plus (C) such non-Affected Lender s Ratable Share (after giving effect to the reallocation contemplated in this   Section 2.19(c)(i)  ) of the outstanding Swingline Exposure, does not exceed such non-Affected Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment;  
  (ii)    if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Agent (x) first, prepay such unallocable Swingline Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize for the benefit of the applicable Issuing Bank only the Borrower s obligations corresponding to such Affected Lender s Ratable Share of the Available Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) (the    Affected Lender Share   ) in accordance with the procedures set forth in   Section 2.03(h)   for so long as such there shall be any Available Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit; 
  (iii)    if the Ratable Share of the Available Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit and the Swingline Exposure of the non-Affected Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this   Section 2.19(c)  , then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to   Section 2.04(a)   and   Section 2.04(b)     shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Affected Lenders  Ratable Shares; 
  (iv)    if any Affected Lender Share is not reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above and if the Borrower fails to Cash Collateralize any portion of such Affected Lender Share pursuant to clause (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, the fee payable under   Section 2.04(b)   with respect to such Affected Lender Share shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until such Affected Lender Share is reallocated; and  
  (v)    if the Borrower Cash Collateralizes any portion of any Affected Lender Share pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Affected Lender pursuant to   Section 2.04(b)(i)   or the applicable Issuing Bank pursuant to   Section 2.04(b)(ii)   (solely with respect to any fronting fee) with respect to such Affected Lender s Affected Lender Share during the period such Affected Lender s Affected Lender Share is Cash Collateralized; 
  (d)    to the extent the Agent receives any payments or other amounts for the account of an Affected Lender under this Agreement, such Affected Lender shall be deemed to have requested that the Agent use such payment or other amount to fulfill such Affected Lender s previously unsatisfied obligations to fund a Revolving Advance under   Section 2.03(c)   or   Section 2.03A(c)   or L/C Advance or any other unfunded payment obligation of such Affected Lender under this Agreement; and 
  
   46 

(e)    subject to   Section 8.18  , for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower, each Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, the Agent and each other Lender shall retain and reserve its other rights and remedies respecting each Affected Lender. 
  In the event that the Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks each agrees that an Affected Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be an Affected Lender, then the Ratable Shares of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Advances of the other Lenders as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Revolving Advances in accordance with its Ratable Share.  In addition, at such time as the Affected Lender is replaced by another Lender pursuant to   Section 2.20  , the Ratable Shares of the Lenders will be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of the replacing Lender s Commitment in accordance with   Section 2.20  .  In either such case, this   Section 2.19   will no longer apply. 
  Section 2.20      Replacement of Lenders  .   If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.11  , or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.14  , or if any Lender is an Affected Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,   Section 8.07  ), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to one or more assignees that shall assume such obligations (which any such assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),   provided   that: 
  (a)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee specified in   Section 8.07(b)  ; 
  (b)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Revolving Advances and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under   Section 8.04(e)  ) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
  (c)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under   Section 2.11   or payments required to be made pursuant to   Section 2.14  , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and 
  (d)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws. 
  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

(c)    To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), any Issuing Bank or any Related Party of any of the foregoing (and without limiting its obligation to do so), each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Issuing Bank or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender s Ratable Share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount,   provided   that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Issuing Bank in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Issuing Bank in connection with such capacity.   
  (d)    Without limiting the rights of indemnification of the Indemnified Parties set forth in this Agreement with respect to liabilities asserted by third parties, each party hereto also agrees not to assert any claim for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages against the other parties hereto, or any Related Party of any party hereto, on any theory of liability, arising out of or otherwise relating to the Notes, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances or the Letters of Credit.  No Indemnified Party shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including Intralinks, SyndTrak or similar systems) in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,   provided   that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnified Party, be available to the extent such damages are found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party s gross negligence or willful misconduct.   
  (e)    If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Revolving Advance, as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to   Section 2.08(d)   or   (e)  ,   Section 2.10   or   Section 2.12  , acceleration of the maturity of the Revolving Advances pursuant to   Section 6.01   or for any other reason, or by an Eligible Assignee to a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Revolving Advance upon an assignment of rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to   Section 8.07   as a result of a demand by the Borrower pursuant to   Section 2.19  , the Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or Conversion, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Revolving Advance. 
  (f)    Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in   Section 2.02(c)  ,   Section 2.11  ,   Section 2.14   and   Section 8.04   shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes. 
  
   70

Each Lender and each Issuing Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application,   provided   that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.  The rights of each Lender and each Issuing Bank under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender may have. 
  Section 8.06      Effectiveness; Binding Effect  .  Except as provided in   Section 3.01  , this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Agent and when the Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders (and any purported assignment without such consent shall be null and void).

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
  
   71 

(b)    Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees (other than to an Ineligible Institution) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, Swingline Exposure and the Revolving Advances (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it);   provided   that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
  (i)      Minimum Amounts  . 
  (A)    in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment and the Revolving Advances at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
  (B)    in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment (which for this purpose includes Revolving Advances outstanding thereunder) or, if the Revolving Credit Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Revolving Advances of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to which such assignment is delivered to the Agent or, if  Trade Date  is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
  (ii)      Proportionate Amounts  .  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Revolving Advances, L/C Obligations, Swingline Exposure or the Revolving Credit Commitment assigned, and each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement; 
  (iii)      Required Consents  .  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition: 
  (A)    the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received written notice thereof) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; 
  (B)    the consent of the Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender;  
  
   72 

(C)    the consent of each Issuing Bank (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and 
  (D)    the consent of the Swingline Lender, if any, (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under Swingline Advances (whether or not then outstanding). 
  (iv)      Assignment and Assumption  .  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500;   provided  ,   however  , that no such fee shall be payable in the case of an assignment made at the request of the Borrower to an existing Lender.  The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
  (v)      No Assignment to Ineligible Institutions  .  No such assignment shall be made to any Ineligible Institution. 
  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section and notice thereof to the Borrower, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of   Section 2.11  ,   Section 2.14   and   Section 8.04   with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment.  Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. 
  (c)      Register  .  The Agent shall maintain at the Agent s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving Credit Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Advances and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the    Register   ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
  (d)      Participations  .  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than an Ineligible Institution)  
  
   73 

(each, a    Participant   ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment, Swingline Exposure and/or the Revolving Advances (including such Lender s participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it);   provided   that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrower, the Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, any Obligations or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, any Obligations or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation. 
  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification addressing the matters set forth in clause (iv) above to the extent subject to such participation.  Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 2.11  ,   Section 2.14   and   Section 8.04(e)   to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 8.05   as though it were a Lender,   provided   such Participant agrees to be subject to   Section 2.15   as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the    Participant Register      provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  (e)      Limitations upon Participant Rights  .  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Section 2.11   or   Section 2.14   than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of   Section  
  
   74 

2.14   unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with   Section 2.14(e)   as though it were a Lender. 
  (f)      Certain Pledges  .  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central banking authority;   provided   that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
  (g)      Resignation as an Issuing Bank after Assignment  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time any Issuing Bank assigns all of its Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Advances     pursuant to subsection (b) above, such Issuing Bank may, upon 30 days  notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as an Issuing Bank.  If any Issuing Bank resigns, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an Issuing Bank and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Advances or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)).   
  (h)    The words  execution,   signed,   signature,  and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state Laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.  
  Section 8.08      Confidentiality  .  Neither the Agent nor any Lender may disclose to any Person any confidential, proprietary or non-public information of the Borrower furnished to the Agent or the Lenders by the Borrower (such information being referred to collectively herein as the    Borrower Information   ), except that each of the Agent and each of the Lenders may disclose Borrower Information (i) to its and its Affiliates  employees, officers, directors, agents and advisors having a need to know in connection with this Agreement (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Borrower Information and instructed to keep such Borrower Information confidential on substantially the same terms as provided herein), (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority or self-regulatory body, (iii) to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party to this Agreement, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this   Section 8.08  , (A) to any assignee or participant or prospective assignee or participant, (B) to any direct, indirect, actual or prospective counterparty (and its advisor) to any swap, derivative or securitization transaction related to the obligations under this Agreement and (C)  to any credit insurance provider relating to the Borrower and its Obligations, (vii) to the extent such Borrower  
  
   75 

Information (A) is or becomes generally available to the public on a non-confidential basis other than as a result of a breach of this   Section 8.08   by the Agent or such Lender or their Related Parties, or (B) is or becomes available to the Agent or such Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower (provided that the source of such information was not known by the recipient after inquiry to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Borrower or any other Person with respect to such information) and (viii) with the consent of the Borrower.  The obligations under this   Section 8.08   shall survive for two calendar years after the date of the termination of this Agreement.

Except to the extent expressly set forth in the preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction.  
  (b)    Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

  Section 8.16      Survival of Representations and Warranties  .  All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.  Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Agent or any Lender or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Advance or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 
  Section 8.17      Severability  .

    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a) 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b) 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c) 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           d) 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           a) 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b) 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
