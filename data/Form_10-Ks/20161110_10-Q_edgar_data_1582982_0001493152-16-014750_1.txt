Forward
Looking Statements  

Certain
statements that we make from time to time, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute  forward-looking
statements    within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical
fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. These statements relate to anticipated future
events, future results of operations or future financial performance. In some cases you can identify forward-looking statements
by terminology such as  may,   might,   will,   should,   intends, 
 expects,   plans,   goals,   projects,   anticipates,   believes, 
 estimates,   predicts,   potential,  or  continue  or the negative of these terms
or other comparable terminology. Our operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, and any
one of which, or a combination of which, could materially affect our results of operations and whether the forward-looking statements
ultimately prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, without limitation,
statements reflecting management s expectations for future financial performance and operating expenditures, expected growth,
profitability and business outlook, increased sales and marketing expenses, and the expected results from the integration of our
acquisitions.   

These
forward-looking statements are only predictions, are uncertain and involve substantial known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors which may cause our (or our industry s) actual results, levels of activity or performance to be materially
different from any future results, levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of the risks and uncertainties
that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, risks and uncertainties relating to:   

our
    ability to manage our growth, including acquiring, partnering with, and effectively integrating other businesses into our
    infrastructure;    

our
    ability to retain our customers and revenue levels, including effectively migrating and keeping new customers acquired through
    business acquisitions and maintaining or growing the revenue levels of our new and existing customers;    

our
    ability to attract and retain key officers and employees, including Mahmud Haq and personnel critical to the transitioning
    and integration of our newly acquired businesses;    

our
    ability to raise capital and obtain and maintain financing on acceptable terms;     

our
    ability to compete with other companies developing products and selling services competitive with ours, and who may have greater
    resources and name recognition than we have;    

our
    ability to maintain operations in Pakistan and Poland in a manner that continues to enable us to offer competitively priced
    products and services;    

our
    ability to keep and increase market acceptance of our products and services;    

our
    ability to keep pace with a rapidly changing healthcare industry;    

our
    ability to consistently achieve and maintain compliance with a myriad of Federal, State, foreign, local, payor and industry
    requirements, regulations, rules and laws;    

our
    ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights;     

our
    ability to maintain and protect the privacy of customer and patient information; and    

our
    ability to meet continuing listing standards on the Nasdaq Capital Market, including its requirement that the minimum bid
    price for our own common stock be at or above $1.00.    

The
foregoing factors are in addition to the other risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in our other SEC filings.   

We
cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity or performance. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These cautionary statements should be considered
with any written or oral forward-looking statements that we may issue in the future. Except as required by applicable law, including
the securities laws of the U.S., we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to reflect actual results, later events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our forward-looking
statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or other investments
or strategic transactions we may engage in.   

All
references to  MTBC,   Medical Transcription Billing, Corp.,   we,   us,   our 
or the  Company  mean Medical Transcription Billing, Corp. and its subsidiaries, except where it is made clear that
the term means only the parent company.

1.
Organization and Business  

Medical
Transcription Billing, Corp. (and together with its subsidiaries,  MTBC  or the  Company ) is a healthcare
information technology company that offers an integrated suite of proprietary electronic health records and practice management
solutions, together with related business services, to healthcare providers. The Company s integrated services are designed
to help customers increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while reducing administrative
burdens and operating costs. The Company s services include full-scale revenue cycle management, electronic health records
and other technology-driven practice management services for private and hospital-employed healthcare providers. MTBC has
its corporate offices in Somerset, New Jersey and its main operating facilities in Islamabad, Pakistan and Bagh, Pakistan. The
Company also has a wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland and small offices in 4 other states.  

MTBC
was founded in 1999 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2001. MTBC Private Limited (or  MTBC Pvt.
Ltd. ) is a majority-owned subsidiary of MTBC based in Pakistan and was founded in 2004. MTBC owns 99.99% of the authorized
outstanding shares of MTBC Pvt. Ltd. and the remaining 0.01% of the shares of MTBC Pvt. Ltd. is owned by the founder and chief
executive officer of MTBC. MTBC-Europe Sp. z.o.o. (or  MTBC-Europe ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MTBC based in
Poland and was founded in 2015.  

Effective
September 23, 2016, the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, MTBC Acquisition, Corp. (or  MAC ) in connection
with an acquisition.  

2.
LIQUIDITY   

The
Company generated net losses before tax of $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $1.4 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $494,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. The Company continues to reduce expenses, with the goal of generating positive cash flow from operations.  

The
Company has a credit facility with Opus Bank ( Opus ) established in the third quarter of 2015, which provides additional
liquidity. The credit facility includes term loans plus a line of credit that have a combined borrowing limit of $10 million,
all of which were fully utilized as of September 30, 2016. The term loans expire September 1, 2019 and the line of credit expires
September 1, 2018 unless renewed. The Company relies on the term loans and line of credit for working capital purposes. (See Note
8.)  

The
Company completed a preferred stock offering in November 2015 and raised approximately $4.7 million after expenses. An additional
preferred stock offering was completed in July, 2016, which raised approximately $1.3 million after expenses. The preferred stock
is redeemable at the Company s option after five years, and is not subject to conversion, mandatory redemption or sinking
fund provisions.  

The
Company had a current cash balance of $7.1 million at September 30, 2016. In October, as a result of the MediGain acquisition,
the Company made the initial $2 million payment. The Company is preparing to file a Form S-1 to sell additional Series A
Preferred Stock to fund the remaining $5 million unsecured payment related to the MediGain acquisition (See Note17.) Upon
completion of this offering, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements
for at least the next 12 months. Although MTBC believes there will be sufficient investor interest and is confident in its
ability to raise adequate capital, there is no assurance that the Company s anticipated preferred stock offering will be
successful or raise sufficient funds. In the event the Company is not able to raise sufficient funds in time to make the payment
in January, 2017, then we will seek other sources of financing.  

3.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and as required by Regulation
S-X, Rule 10-01. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain
all adjustments (consisting of items of a normal and recurring nature) necessary to present fairly the Company s financial
position as of September 30, 2016, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and
cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. When preparing financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  

The
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements     From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we
believe that the impact of recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   

In
May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09 , Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
 which is authoritative guidance that implements a common revenue model that will enhance comparability across industries and
requires enhanced disclosures. The new revenue recognition standard eliminates the transaction and industry-specific revenue recognition
guidance under the current rules and replaces it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. The new
standard introduces a five-step principles based process to determine the timing and amount of revenue ultimately expected to
be received from the customer. The core principle of the revenue recognition standard is that an entity should recognize revenue
to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. This amendment will be effective for the Company s interim and
annual consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2018 with either retrospective or modified retrospective treatment applied.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this may have on the consolidated financial statements upon implementation.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,  which provides guidance on determining when
and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires
management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year
of the date of issuance of the entity s financial statements (or within one year after the date on which the financial statements
are available to be issued, when applicable). Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is  substantial
doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  This guidance is effective for annual reporting
periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.
The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements,
other than potentially on the footnote disclosures.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  (Topic 740). The amendments
in this ASU require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial
position. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current
requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single
amount is not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect
the guidance in this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases  (Topic 842). The new standard will require organizations that lease
assets   referred to as  lessees    to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the
rights and obligations created by those leases. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities
for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement and presentation
of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating
lease. However, unlike current GAAP   which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet   the
new ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The amendments in this ASU are effective for
financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with earlier adoption permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard.  

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ), which provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment
accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, accounting for forfeitures and classification
on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017 and will be applied
either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition approach depending on the area covered in this
update. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2016-09 on the Company s consolidated financial
statements and disclosures.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments
 (Topic 230). The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the
statement of cash flows. In the third quarter of 2016 the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-15. This accounting standard
requires that cash payments not made soon after the acquisition date of a business combination by an acquirer to settle a contingent
consideration liability should be separated and classified as cash outflows for financing activities and operating activities.
Cash payments up to the amount of the contingent consideration liability recognized at the acquisition date (including measurement-period
adjustments) should be classified as financing activities; any excess should be classified as operating activities. Cash payments
made soon after the acquisition date of a business combination by an acquirer to settle a contingent consideration liability should
be classified as cash outflows for investing activities. The Company had no contingent consideration payments prior to
September 30, 2015.

ACQUISITIONS  

2016
Acquisitions    

Effective
July 1, 2016, (the  WFS Closing Date ), the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement ( APA ) with
WFS Services, Inc., ( WFS ) a New Jersey corporation, pursuant to which the Company purchased substantially
all of the assets of WFS. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. In accordance with the WFS APA, the
Company did not pay any initial cash consideration on the WFS Closing Date but will make monthly payments of $5,000 for three
years beginning July, 2016 subject to proportionate adjustment if annualized revenues decrease below a threshold specified in
the APA. In addition, each quarter the Company will pay WFS fifty percent (50%) of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the WFS APA,
generated from the WFS customer accounts acquired for three years. The aggregate preliminary purchase price of WFS was
determined to be $298,000, which was recorded as contingent consideration.  

On
May 2, 2016, (the  RMB Closing Date ), the Company entered into an APA with Renaissance Medical Billing, LLC ( RMB ),
a Tennessee limited liability company, pursuant to which the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of RMB. The acquisition
has been accounted for as a business combination. In accordance with the RMB APA, the Company paid $175,000 in initial cash consideration
( RMB Initial Payment ), on the RMB Closing Date. In addition, the Company will pay RMB twenty-seven percent (27%)
of the revenue earned and received from the acquired RMB accounts for three years, less the RMB Initial Payment which will be
deducted in full from the required payments (the  RMB Installment Payments ) before any additional payment is made
to the seller. The RMB Installment Payments are paid quarterly which commenced July, 2016. The aggregate preliminary purchase
price for RMB was $325,000 which consisted of cash of $175,000 and contingent consideration of $150,000.  

On
February 15, 2016 (the  GCB Closing Date ), the Company entered into an APA with Gulf Coast Billing Inc., ( GCB )
a Texas corporation and a revenue cycle management company, pursuant to which the Company purchased substantially all of the assets
of GCB. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The aggregate final purchase price for GCB was $1,480,000

the GCB Initial Payment (the  GCB Installment Payments ). The GCB Installment Payments are paid quarterly which commenced
July 2016.  

The
above acquisitions added a significant number of clients to the Company s customer base and, similar to previous acquisitions,
broadened the Company s presence in the healthcare information technology industry through geographic expansion of its customer
base and by increasing available customer relationship resources and specialized trained staff.  

The
Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist the Company in valuing the assets acquired from GCB and RMB. The
purchase price allocation for WFS was performed by the Company. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation.

GOODWILL AND Intangible Assets   NET  

The
following is the summary of the changes to the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the
year ended December 31, 2015:  

Intangible
assets - net as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of following:  

Amortization
expense was $3,167,736 and $3,188,294 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $989,540 and $1,024,971
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted-average amortization period is three years.

As

Concentrations  

Financial
Risks    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held Pakistani rupees of 50,155,689, (US $479,509)
and Pakistani rupees of 78,891,565 (US $750,880), respectively, in the name of its subsidiary at banks in Pakistan. Funds are
wired to Pakistan near the end of each month to cover payroll at the beginning of the next month and operating expenses throughout
the month. The banking system in Pakistan does not provide deposit insurance coverage. Additionally, from time to time, the Company
maintains cash balances at financial institutions in the United States in excess of federal insurance limits. The Company has
not experienced any losses on such accounts.  

Concentrations
of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are managed by periodic credit evaluations of customers. The Company
does not require collateral for outstanding trade accounts receivable. No one customer accounts for a significant portion of the
Company s trade accounts receivable portfolio and write-offs have not been significant.  

Geographical
Risks    The Company s offices in Islamabad and Bagh, Pakistan, conduct significant back-office operations for
the Company. The Company has no revenue earned outside of the United States. The office in Bagh is located in a different territory
of Pakistan from the Islamabad office. The Bagh office was opened in 2009 for the purpose of providing operational support and
operating as a backup to the Islamabad office. The Company s office in Poland was opened in 2015 to serve as back-up to
the Pakistan offices in addition to performing specialized work. The Poland office would need to be significantly expanded to
serve as a full back-up facility. The Company s operations in Pakistan are subject to special considerations and significant
risks not typically associated with companies in the United States. The Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations may be influenced by the political, economic, and legal environment in Pakistan and by the general state of Pakistan s
economy. The Company s results may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in governmental policies with respect
to laws and regulations, changes in Pakistan s telecommunications industry, regulatory rules and policies, anti-inflationary
measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation.  

The
carrying amounts of net assets located in Pakistan were $1,222,603 and $1,049,501 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. These balances exclude intercompany receivables of $4,428,321 and $3,434,687 as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. The following is a summary of the net assets located in Pakistan as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015:  

The
net assets located in Poland were not significant at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  

7.
NET LOss per COMMON share  

The
following table presents our basic and diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Unvested restricted stock units ( RSUs )
of 294,460 and 401,732 as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively have been excluded from the above calculation as
they were anti-dilutive. Vested RSUs and restricted shares have been included in the above calculations. 

The
net loss per share-diluted excludes both the 248,625 and 1,287,529 of contingently issued shares at September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and the 200,000 warrants granted to Opus, as the effect would be anti-dilutive.  

8.
Debt  

Opus
Bank    On September 2, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Opus. Opus extended three credit facilities
totaling $10 million to the Company, inclusive of the following: (1) a $4 million term loan; (2) a $2 million revolving line of
credit; and (3) an additional $4 million of term loans that were issued subsequent to September, 2015.   

The
Company s obligations to Opus are secured by substantially all of the Company s domestic assets and 65% of the shares
in its Pakistan subsidiary.  

The
interest rate on all Opus loans will equal the higher of (a) the prime rate plus 1.75% and (b) 5.0%. The commitment fee on the
unused revolving line of credit is 0.5% per annum. The term loans mature on September 1, 2019 and the revolving line of credit
will terminate on September 1, 2018, unless extended. As of September 30, 2016, all of the term loans and the line of credit have
been fully utilized. Beginning October 1, 2016 the term loans require total monthly principal payments of $222,222 per month through
the end of the loan period.  

In
connection with the Opus debt, the Company paid $100,000 of fees and issued warrants for Opus to purchase 100,000 shares of its
common stock. The warrants have a strike price equal to $5.00 per share, a seven year exercise window, piggyback registration
and net exercise rights. The fees paid and warrants issued to Opus were recorded as a debt discount. The warrants were classified
as equity instruments and are included in additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  

The
Opus credit agreement contains various covenants and conditions governing the long term debt and line of credit. As of September
30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all the covenants contained in the Opus credit agreement. During July 2016, the Opus
credit agreement was modified to amend covenants regarding certain financial ratios to be maintained during the remaining term
of the loan, providing the Company with additional flexibility. In exchange for the modification, the Company paid a fee of $25,000
to Opus and issued additional warrants for Opus to purchase 100,000 shares of its common stock at a strike price equal to $5.00
per share, with similar terms to the previous warrants issued. The additional warrants were valued at approximately $52,000 and
have been accounted for similarly to the previous warrants.  

Total
debt issuance costs were $627,000 and recorded as an offset to the face amount of the loans. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 approximately $92,000 of the debt issuance costs were capitalized in connection with the final portion of the additional
$4 million term loan received in the period. Discounts from the face amount of the loans are amortized over 4 years using
the effective interest rate method. As a result of the loan discounts, the effective interest rate on the borrowings from Opus
as of September 30, 2016 is approximately 7.61%.  

The
Opus term loans at September 30, 2016 are recorded at their accredited value and consist of the following:  

Vehicle
Financing Notes    The Company financed certain vehicle purchases both in the United States and in Pakistan. The vehicle
financing notes have 3 to 5 year terms and were issued at current market rates.  

Insurance
Financing    The Company financed certain insurance purchases over the term of the policy life. The interest rate charged
is 6.5%.  

Obligation
for customer relationships    During November 2015, the Company purchased customer relationships from a medical billing
company for $435,000. The remaining amount of $125,000 is anticipated to be settled during 2016.  

Maturities
of the outstanding notes payable, term loans and other obligations as of September 30, 2016 are as follows:

symbol  MTBCP.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  

In
April 2014, the Company adopted the Medical Transcription Billing, Corp. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ),
reserving a total of 1,351,000 shares of common stock for grants to employees, officers, directors and consultants. As of September
30, 2016, 353,235 shares are available for grant. Permissible awards include incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs ), performance stock and cash-settled awards
and other stock-based awards in the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, including unrestricted
stock grants.  

The
RSUs contain a provision in which the units shall immediately vest and become converted into the right to receive a cash payment
payable on the original vesting date after a change in control as defined in the award agreement.  

The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the issuance of a total of 225,000 restricted shares of common stock,
with vesting contingent on meeting 2015 financial objectives, to three senior executives. The outside members of the Board of
Directors were also awarded a total of 100,000 restricted shares of common stock with the same vesting. During March 2016, all
of the restricted shares vested upon the achievement of specified operating results and are included in the issued and outstanding
common shares as of September 30, 2016.  

The
Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the total requisite service period for the entire award.
For RSUs classified as equity, the market price of our common stock on the date of grant is used in recording the fair value of
the award. For RSUs classified as a liability, the earned amount is marked to market based on the end of period common stock price.

INCOME TAXES   

The
tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $126,236 and there was a tax benefit of $35,998 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, respectively. There was a tax expense of $45,309 and a tax benefit of $52,051 during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The current provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 represents state minimum taxes and taxes attributable to Pakistan. The deferred provision for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 of $41,552 and $114,893 related to the amortization of goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized for financial
reporting purposes; however, it is deductible and therefore amortized over 15 years for tax purposes. As such, deferred income
tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the tax deductibility of this indefinitely-lived asset. The resulting
deferred tax liability, which is expected to continue to increase over the amortization period, will have an indefinite life.
This deferred tax liability could remain on the Company s consolidated balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment
of goodwill (for financial reporting purposes) or a portion of the business is sold.  

Although
the Company is forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset
difficult to support in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance
has been recorded against all Federal and state deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The
Company s plan to repatriate earnings in Pakistan to the United States requires that U.S. Federal taxes be provided on the
Company s earnings in Pakistan. For state tax purposes, the Company s Pakistan earnings generally are not taxed due
to a subtraction modification available in most states.  

15.
OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME   NET   

Other
(expense) income - net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 consisted of the following:  

Foreign
currency transaction gains (losses) result from transactions related to the intercompany receivables for which transaction adjustments
are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as they are not deemed to be permanently reinvested.  

16.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amounts of cash, receivables and accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximated their estimated fair values because of the short term nature of these financial instruments. Our notes payable, line
of credit and term loans are carried at cost and approximate fair value since the interest rates being charged approximates market
rates.  

Contingent
Consideration   

The
Company s contingent consideration of $1,089,099 and $1,172,508 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
are Level 3 liabilities. The fair value of the contingent consideration at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was primarily
driven by estimates of revenue recognized and collected payments from acquired customers, the passage of time, the associated
discount rate and for one acquisition, the price of the Company s common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT  

On
October 3, 2016, MAC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MTBC, acquired substantially all the medical billing business and assets of
MediGain, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ( MediGain ), and its subsidiary Millennium Practice Management Associates,
LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company ( Millennium ). The assets were acquired through a strict foreclosure
process whereby MAC acquired senior secured notes secured by the assets of MediGain and Millennium, and immediately thereafter
foreclosed on the assets in satisfaction of the senior secured notes. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $7,000,000
and will be funded by MTBC. As part of the agreement, MAC acquired the assets as well as certain liabilities expressly assumed.
Cash and certain causes of action relating to pre-closing matters were excluded from the acquired assets and retained by MediGain
and Millennium.  

The
senior secured notes were purchased from Prudential Insurance Company of America and Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity
Company pursuant to an assignment agreement dated October 3, 2016. MTBC paid $2,000,000 of the purchase price at closing and is
obligated to pay the remaining $5,000,000 within 90 days thereafter, although there is no formal promissory note and the
obligation is unsecured in the assignment agreement. The Company is planning an additional sale of its preferred stock
to raise funds to pay the remaining $5,000,000 purchase price.  

As
a result of the acquisition, the Company will have additional locations throughout the United States and facilities in India and
Sri Lanka. Similar to the facilities in Pakistan and Poland, the facilities in India and Sri Lanka will also do back office processing.  

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Overview  

MTBC is a healthcare information technology
company that provides a fully integrated suite of proprietary web-based solutions, together with related business services, to
healthcare providers practicing in ambulatory settings and industry vendors. Our integrated Software-as-a-Service (or SaaS) platform
is designed to help our customers increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while
reducing administrative burdens and operating costs. We employ a highly educated workforce of approximately 1,450 people in Pakistan,
as of September 30, 2016, where we believe labor costs are approximately one-half the cost of comparable India-based employees,
and one-tenth the cost of comparable U.S. employees, thus enabling us to deliver our solutions at competitive prices. 

Our flagship offering, PracticePro,
empowers healthcare practices with the core software and business services they need to address industry challenges on one
unified SaaS platform. We deliver powerful, integrated solutions to healthcare practices, which enable them to
efficiently operate their businesses, manage clinical workflows and receive timely payment for their services. PracticePro
consists of: 

Practice management software and related tools, which facilitate the day-to-day operation of a medical practice;   

Electronic health records (or EHR), which are easy to use, highly ranked, and allow our customers to reduce paperwork and qualify for government incentives;   

Revenue cycle management (or RCM) services, which include end-to-end medical billing, analytics, and related services; and   

Mobile Health (or mHealth) solutions, including smartphone applications that assist patients and healthcare providers in the provision of healthcare services.   

Adoption of our solutions
requires only a modest upfront expenditure by a provider. Additionally, our financial performance is linked directly to the financial
performance of our clients because the vast majority of our revenues are based on a percentage of our clients  collections.
The standard fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution is calculated as a percentage of a practice s healthcare-related
revenues plus a one-time setup fee, and is among the lowest in the industry. 

Our growth strategy involves four primary approaches:
acquiring RCM companies and then migrating the customers of those companies to our solutions, partnering with smaller RCM companies
to service their customers while paying them a share of revenue received, partnering with EHR and other vendors that lack an integrated
solution and integrating our solutions with their offerings and selling our solutions directly to healthcare providers practicing
in ambulatory settings. 

The RCM service industry is highly fragmented,
with many local and regional RCM companies serving small medical practices. We believe that the industry is ripe for consolidation
and that we can achieve significant growth through acquisitions and partnerships. We further believe that it is becoming increasingly
difficult for traditional RCM companies to meet the growing technology and business service needs of healthcare providers without
a significant investment in information technology infrastructure. 

We acquired certain assets (primarily customer
relationships) of three small companies during the first nine months of 2016. In conjunction with these acquisitions and partnerships,
we hired or retained a small number of talented employees and contractors who we are leveraging to support our growth. 

We believe we will also be able to accelerate
organic growth by partnering with EHR companies who do not offer revenue cycle management services, utilizing them as channel partners
to offer integrated solutions to their customers. We have also entered into arrangements with industry participants including emerging
EHR providers and other healthcare vendors that lack a full suite of solutions. We have developed application interfaces with several
EHR systems to create integrated offerings. 

Our Pakistan operations
accounted for approximately 32% of expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 33% of total expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. A significant portion of those expenses was personnel-related costs (approximately 81%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 75% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016). Because personnel-related
costs are significantly lower in Pakistan than in the U.S. and many other offshore locations, we believe our Pakistan operations
give us a competitive advantage over many industry participants. All of the companies that we acquired or signed revenue-sharing
arrangements with use domestic labor or labor from higher cost locations to provide all or a substantial portion of their services.
We are able to achieve significant cost reductions as we shift these domestic labor costs to Pakistan. 

On October 3, 2016, MTBC Acquisition, Corp.
( MAC ), a newly formed, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MTBC, acquired substantially all the medical billing business
and assets of MediGain, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ( MediGain ), and its subsidiary Millennium Practice
Management Associates, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company ( Millennium ). The assets, including accounts receivable,
customer relationships, fixed assets and two wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries of MediGain, located in India and Sri Lanka, were
acquired through a strict foreclosure process whereby MAC acquired senior secured notes secured by the assets of MediGain and Millennium,
and immediately thereafter foreclosed on the assets in satisfaction of the senior secured notes. The total purchase price for the
acquisition was $7,000,000 and will be funded by MTBC. 

In connection with this acquisition, MTBC
expects to generate at least $10 million of annual revenue from the customers acquired. Although there is no assurance
that the customers will remain with MTBC, the Company expects that this acquisition will be accretive to earnings during 2017.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, we will begin to integrate the acquired operations with MTBC, but will have offshore operations
in Sri Lanka and India as well as Pakistan, and will have a significant number of additional U.S.-based employees from MediGain. 

Key Performance
Measures  

We consider numerous
factors in assessing our performance. Key performance measures used by management, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin,
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share, are non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe better enable management
and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period. 

These non-GAAP financial
measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP. ) Moreover, these non-GAAP financial
measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of our business as determined
in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as
a non-GAAP basis, and we provide reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial
measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies,
including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting
the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 

Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA Margin, Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income per Share provide an alternative view of performance
used by management and we believe that an investor s understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these adjusted
performance measures. 

Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude the following elements which are included in GAAP Net Income (Loss): 

Income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;   

Interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;   

Foreign currency gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, and asset impairment charges and other non-cash non-operating expenditures;   

Stock-based compensation expense, including customer incentives and cash-settled awards, based on changes in the stock price;   

Non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, and does not reflect any cash requirements for replacement for capital expenditures;   

Integration costs, such as severance amounts paid to employees from acquired businesses or transaction costs, such as brokerage fees, pre-acquisition accounting costs and legal fees, exit costs related to terminating leases and other contractual agreements, and other costs related to specific transactions; and   

Changes in contingent consideration.   

Set forth below is a presentation of our Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015: 

Non-GAAP Adjusted
Net Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income per Share exclude the following elements which are included in GAAP Net Income (Loss): 

Foreign currency gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, and asset impairment charges and other non-cash non-operating expenditures;   

Stock-based compensation expense, including customer incentives and cash-settled awards, based on changes in the stock price;   

Amortization of purchased intangible assets;   

Integration costs, such as severance amounts paid to employees from acquired businesses or transaction costs, such as brokerage fees, pre-acquisition accounting costs and legal fees, exit costs related to terminating leases and other contractual agreements, and other costs related to specific transactions;   

Changes in contingent consideration; and   

Income tax expense resulting from the amortization of goodwill related to our acquisitions.   

No tax effect has been provided in computing
Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income per Share as the Company has sufficient carry forward losses to offset
the applicable income taxes. The following table shows our reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015: 

For purposes of determining Non-GAAP Adjusted
Net Income per Share, the Company used the number of common shares outstanding at the end of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, including the shares which were issued but have not been settled, and considered contingent consideration, in order to provide
insight into the results considering the total number of shares which were issued at the time of the acquisitions. Accordingly,
the end-of-period shares include 248,625 and 1,287,529 of contingently issuable shares at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Key Metrics  

In addition to the
line items in our consolidated financial statements, we regularly review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure
our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections, make strategic business decisions, and assess
market share trends and our working capital needs. We believe information from these metrics is useful for investors to understand
the underlying trends in our business. 

Set forth below are
our key operating and financial metrics for RCM customers using our platform, which excludes acquired customers who have not migrated
to our platform as well as customers of our clearinghouse, EDI and other services. Revenue from practices using our platform accounted
for approximately 73% of our RCM revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and approximately 75% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. 

First Pass Acceptance
Rate:   We define first pass acceptance rate as the percentage of claims submitted electronically by us to insurers and clearinghouses
that are accepted on the first submission and are not rejected for reasons such as insufficient information or improper coding.
Our first-time acceptance rate is 96% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, which compares favorably to the average of
the top twelve payers of approximately 94%, as reported by the American Medical Association. 

First Pass Resolution
Rate:   First pass resolution rate measures the percentage of primary claims that are favorably adjudicated and closed upon
a single submission. Our first pass resolution rate was approximately 94% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016. 

Days in Accounts
Receivable:   Days in accounts receivable measures the median number of days between the day a claim is submitted by us on
behalf of our customer, and the date the claim is paid to our customer. Our clients  median days in accounts receivable was
31 days for primary care and 39 days for combined specialties for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the
national average of 36 and 40 days, respectively, as reported by the Medical Group Management Association in 2015. 

Providers and
Practices Served  . As of September 30, 2016, we provided RCM and related services to approximately 1,820 providers (which
we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills for their
services), representing approximately 740 practices. In addition, we served approximately 250 clients who were not medical practices,
but are service organizations who serve the healthcare community. As of September 30, 2015, we served approximately 1,700 providers
representing approximately 770 practices. 

Sources of Revenue  

Revenue:  We primarily derive our revenues
from revenue cycle management services, typically billed as a percentage of payments collected by our customers. This fee includes
RCM as well as the ability to use our electronic health records and practice management software as part of the bundled fee. These
payments accounted for approximately 85% and 86% of our revenues during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, and 89% and 93% of our revenues during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

On July 28, 2014, the Company acquired Omni
Medical Billing Services, LLC, Practicare Medical Management, Inc. and CastleRock Solutions, Inc., (collectively the  2014
Acquisitions ). On July 10, 2015, the Company acquired SoftCare Solutions, Inc. and on August 31, 2015, the Company acquired
Med Tech Professional Billing, (collectively referred to as the  2015 Acquisitions ). On February 15, 2016, the Company
acquired Gulf Coast Billing Inc., ( GCB ), on May 2, 2016, the Company acquired Renaissance Medical Billing, LLC ( RMB )
and on July 1, 2016 the Company acquired WFS Services, Inc. ( WFS ) (collectively referred to as the  2016 Acquisitions ).
The 2014, 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions are (collectively referred to as the  Acquisitions ). Our plan is to move most
of the customers acquired through acquisitions to our operating platform in order to increase efficiencies. 

Operating Expenses     

Direct Operating Costs.  Direct operating
cost consists primarily of salaries and benefits related to personnel who provide services to our customers, claims processing
costs and other direct costs related to our services. Costs associated with the implementation of new customers are expensed as
incurred. The reported amounts of direct operating costs do not include depreciation and amortization, which are broken out separately
in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Selling and Marketing
Expense.  Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, commissions, travel and advertising
expenses. 

Research and Development
Expense.  Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs and third-party contractor costs. 

General and Administrative
Expense.  General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related expense for administrative employees, including
compensation, benefits, travel, occupancy and insurance, software license fees and outside professional fees. 

Change in Contingent Consideration.  The
change in contingent consideration represents the change in the value of the shares in escrow, pending release to the seller of
one of the 2014 Acquisitions, and the change in the estimated future payments to the sellers of the 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions. 

Depreciation and
Amortization Expense.  Depreciation expense is charged using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets
ranging from three to five years. Amortization expense is charged on either an accelerated or on a straight-line basis over a period
of three years for most intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions. 

Interest and Other
Income (Expense).  Interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our working capital line of credit and term
loans, offset by interest income and late fees from customers. Our other income (expense) results primarily from foreign currency
transaction gains (losses). 

Income Tax. 
We estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although the Company is forecasting a return to profitability,
it incurred cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly,
a valuation allowance was recorded against all deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates  

We prepare our financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and related disclosures. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical
experience, current trends and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis,
we review our accounting policies, estimates, assumptions and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly
and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results
could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 

We believe that the
accounting policies are those policies that involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management.
The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of
operations. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in the Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016. 

Results of Operations  

The following table sets forth our consolidated
results of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods shown. 

Comparison of
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenue.  Total revenue of $5.3 million
and $15.7 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $272,000 or 5% and $2.1 million or
12% from revenue of $5.6 million and $17.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease
was primarily due to $4.7 million of less revenue recognized from customers which terminated that were acquired in the
2014 Acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which
was partially offset by additional revenues associated with the 2016 and 2015 Acquisitions. 

Direct Operating
Costs.  Direct operating costs of $2.7 million and $7.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
decreased by $142,000 or 5% and $2 million or 21% from direct operating costs of $2.8 million and $9.3 million for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, salary
cost in the U.S. decreased by $52,000 or 6% and $1.1 million or 34% compared to the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015 due to a decrease in the number of employees to coincide with the reduction in revenue. 

Salary and related
cost in Pakistan decreased by $261,000 or 28% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and decreased by $1.1 million
or 38% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of reducing the number of employees in Pakistan to coincide with
the reduction in revenue. Referral fees from revenue share arrangements decreased by $129,000 or 85% and $319,000 or 81% for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. 

Selling and Marketing
Expense.  Selling and marketing expense of $275,000 and $839,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
increased by $215,000 or 363% and $562,000 or 203% from selling and marketing expense of $59,000 and $277,000 for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. This is primarily related to an increased investment in marketing, business
development and sales resources to expand our market share and build on our existing customer base. 

General and Administrative
Expense.  General and administrative expense of $2.6 million and $8.2 million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, decreased by $520,000 or 17% and $1.2 million or 13% from general and administrative expense of $3.1 million
and $9.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. In addition to salary expense in the U.S.
decreasing by $241,000 and $432,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, due to a decrease in
the number of U.S.-based G A employees, the integration of the 2014 and 2015 Acquisitions was completed, resulting in expense
reductions related to the closing of offices and reducing third party expenses such as computer expenses, accommodation costs,
office costs and insurance expenses. 

Research and Development
Expense.  Research and development expense of $175,000 and $575,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, increased by $16,000 or 10% and $86,000 or 18% from research and development expense of $159,000 and $489,000 for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, as a result of adding additional technical employees in Pakistan. 

Change in Contingent
Consideration.  The change in the contingent consideration was $197,000 and $608,000 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, and reflects the decrease in the estimated value of the consideration to be paid for the SoftCare, Med
Tech and GCB acquisitions, based on decreased estimates of revenue from these acquisitions. It also includes a change in the liability
reflecting the change in value of shares issued to Practicare which have not been released from escrow, resulting from price changes
in the Company s common stock during the periods. The change in the contingent consideration for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 was $1,283,000 and included both a $1,150,000 decrease in the value of shares issued to Practicare and Omni which had
both not been released from escrow at that time and $133,000 related to CastleRock s forfeiture of shares. 

Depreciation.  Depreciation
of $129,000 and $369,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, increased by $16,000 or 15% and
$58,000 or 19% from depreciation of $112,000 and $311,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively,
as a result of the Company purchasing additional fixed assets. 

Amortization Expense.  Amortization expense
of $1.0 million and $3.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, was comparable with the
amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, amortization expense from the 2015 and 2016 Acquisitions was offset by intangible assets acquired in prior
years becoming fully amortized. 

Interest income.
 Interest income of $11,000 and $25,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, was consistent
with the amounts of interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, and primarily represents
late payment fees from customers. 

Interest expense.
 Interest expense of $177,000 and $486,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, increased
by $101,000 or 133% and $325,000 or 201% from interest expense of $76,000 and $161,000 for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, respectively, primarily as a result of additional borrowings on the Opus Bank term loans plus the revolving line of
credit effective September 2, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company utilized all of its $10 million Opus credit facility
compared with a $6 million outstanding facility with Opus Bank at September 30, 2015. 

Other (expense)
income - net.  Other (expense) - net of ($14,000) and ($40,000) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively,
compared to other income - net of $62,000 and $165,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The
net decreases of $76,000 and $206,000 primarily relate to changes in the foreign exchange rates. 

Income tax provision (benefit).  There
was a $45,000 and $126,000 income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared
to a benefit of $52,000 and $36,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Included in the tax provision
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is a $42,000 and $115,000 deferred income tax provision related to the amortization
of goodwill. The pre-tax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased from $1.3 million to $1.4 million and the
pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $4.6 million from $3.9 million. Although the Company is
forecasting a return to profitability, it incurred three years of cumulative losses which make realization of a deferred tax asset
difficult to support in accordance with ASC 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded against all deferred tax assets
at September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources  

The following table
summarizes our cash flows: 

The Company raised
approximately $4.7 million of net proceeds from a public preferred stock offering in November 2015, and raised approximately $1.3
million of net proceeds from additional sales of the same preferred stock in July 2016. In September 2015, the Company secured
a $10 million credit facility from Opus Bank, including an initial $4 million term loan and a $2 million revolving
line of credit. The proceeds of the term loan were used to repay the TD line of credit and other notes payable. Additional term
loans totaling $4 million from Opus Bank were received in late 2015 and in March 2016. 

The Company had a
current cash balance of $7.1 million at September 30, 2016. In October, as a result of the MediGain acquisition, the Company
made the initial $2 million payment. The Company is preparing to file a Form S-1 to sell additional Series A Preferred Stock
to fund the remaining $5 million unsecured payment related to the MediGain acquisition. Upon completion of this
offering, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least
the next 12 months. Although MTBC believes there will be sufficient investor interest and is confident in its ability to raise
adequate capital, there is no assurance that the Company s anticipated preferred stock offering will be successful or raise
sufficient funds. In the event the Company is not able to raise sufficient funds in time to make the payment in January, 2017,
then we will seek other sources of financing. 

Operating Activities   

Cash used in operating activities was $494,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash
used in operating activities was $169,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $446,000 during the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The net loss increased by $886,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily
caused by non-cash items: a decrease of $675,000 in the change in contingent consideration, a $269,000 increase in stock-based
compensation, and $38,000 of additional depreciation and amortization. Cash operating expenses decreased by $783,000 more than
the decline in revenue from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Accounts receivable contributed $45,000 to
cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with a contribution of $622,000 from accounts
receivable for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued expenses increased
by $197,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with a decrease of $1.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

Investing Activities   

Cash used in investing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.7 million, an increase of $1.3 million as compared to $448,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the initial payment of $1.25 million and $175,000 for the GCB
and RMB acquisitions, respectively. For GCB, this amount will be deducted evenly from each of the 12 quarterly payments required
to be made to the seller which began in July 2016. The quarterly payments are based on 28% of revenue. For RMB, the initial payment
will be recovered before any payments are made by the Company. Quarterly payments to RMB began in July, 2016 and are based on 27%
of revenue. 

Financing Activities   

Cash provided by
financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.3 million, compared to $2.9 million during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The cash provided by financing activities in 2016 includes $2 million of additional term
loan borrowings from Opus Bank, offset by a $554,000 repayment of notes payable, $507,000 of preferred stock dividends and $546,000
of purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program. The cash provided by financing activities for 2015 represented
borrowings and repayment on the former TD Bank line of credit and $715,000 of repayment of notes payable. Average monthly borrowings
from our revolving lines of credit were $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $20,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Our line of credit
with Opus Bank expires on September 1, 2018, unless renewed. As of September 30, 2016, $2 million was drawn on the line.
Our term loans with Opus Bank mature on September 1, 2019 and require monthly principal payments which began October 1, 2016 of
$222,000 per month and continue through the end of the loan period. 

Contractual Obligations
and Commitments  

We have contractual
obligations under our borrowings from Opus Bank and unsettled contingent consideration in connection with the Acquisitions. Additionally,
as a result of the MediGain acquisition, the Company has a $5 million unsecured obligation due in January, 2017. We also
maintain operating leases for property and certain office equipment. For additional information, see Contractual Obligations and
Commercial Commitments under Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, 
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016. 

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements  

As of September 30,
2016 and 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often
referred to as structured finance or special-purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Other than our operating leases for office space,
computer equipment and other property, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 

Nasdaq Listing Compliance  

On June 24, 2016, the  Company received
a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq ) that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq s Listing
Rule 5810(b), as the closing bid price of the Company s common stock has been below the minimum closing bid price requirement
of $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. The notification of noncompliance has no immediate effect on the listing or
trading of the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol  MTBC  or of the Company s
Series A Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol  MTBCP.  

In accordance with Nasdaq s Marketplace
Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has an initial period of 180 days, or until December 21, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum
closing bid price requirement, which requires the closing bid for the common stock meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum
of ten consecutive business days during this period. In the event the Company fails to meet this threshold it may be eligible for
an additional 180-day compliance period. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for
market value of publicly held shares set forth in Market Place Rule 5550(a) and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq
Capital Market set forth in Marketplace Rule 5505, with the exception of the closing bid price requirement, and will need to provide
written notice to Nasdaq of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock
split, if necessary. The Company s failure to regain compliance during this period could result in delisting. 

The Company intends to monitor the closing
bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options to regain compliance with the minimum
bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. 

Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks  

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by 17C.F.R. 229.10(f) (1) and are not required to provide information under this item, pursuant to Item 305(e)
of Regulation S-K. 

Item 4. Controls and
Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
September 30, 2016 as required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. The term  disclosure controls and procedures, 
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. 

Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as of September 30, 2016 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date,
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 (f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

From time to time, we may become involved in
legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in
the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
financial condition or cash flows. 

Regardless of outcome, litigation can have
an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputational
harm and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Pursuant to the instructions of Item 1A of
Form 10-Q, a smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds  

There were no unregistered sales of equity
securities by the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Purchases of Equity Securities  

The Company is prohibited from paying dividends
on its common stock without the consent of its senior lender, Opus Bank. 

Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities  

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures  

Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information
