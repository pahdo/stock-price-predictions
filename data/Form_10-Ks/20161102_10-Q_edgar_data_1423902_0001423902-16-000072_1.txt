1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

General.   Western Gas Equity Partners, LP is a Delaware master limited partnership ( MLP ) formed in September 2012 to own three types of partnership interests in Western Gas Partners, LP. Western Gas Equity Partners, LP was formed by converting WGR Holdings, LLC into a limited partnership and changing its name. Western Gas Partners, LP (together with its subsidiaries,  WES ) is a Delaware MLP formed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation in 2007 to acquire, own, develop and operate midstream energy assets.  
  For purposes of these consolidated financial statements,  WGP  refers to Western Gas Equity Partners, LP in its individual capacity or to Western Gas Equity Partners, LP and its subsidiaries, including Western Gas Holdings, LLC and WES, as the context requires.  WES GP  refers to Western Gas Holdings, LLC, individually as the general partner of WES, and excludes WES. WGP s general partner, Western Gas Equity Holdings, LLC ( WGP GP ), is a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. WES GP owns all of the general partner interest in WES, which constitutes substantially all of its business, which primarily is to manage the affairs and operations of WES. Refer to   Note 4   for a discussion of WGP s holdings of WES equity.  Anadarko  refers to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries, excluding WGP and WGP GP, and  affiliates  refers to subsidiaries of Anadarko, excluding WGP, but including equity interests in Fort Union Gas Gathering, LLC ( Fort Union ), White Cliffs Pipeline, LLC ( White Cliffs ), Rendezvous Gas Services, LLC ( Rendezvous ), Enterprise EF78 LLC (the  Mont Belvieu JV ), Texas Express Pipeline LLC ( TEP ), Texas Express Gathering LLC ( TEG ) and Front Range Pipeline LLC ( FRP ). The interests in TEP, TEG and FRP are referred to collectively as the  TEFR Interests.  The  MGR assets  include the Red Desert complex and the Granger straddle plant.  
  WES is engaged in the business of gathering, processing, compressing, treating and transporting natural gas, condensate, NGLs and crude oil for Anadarko, as well as for third-party producers and customers. As of   September 30, 2016  , WES s assets and investments accounted for under the equity method consisted of the following:

These assets and investments are located in the Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Utah and Wyoming), the Mid-Continent (Kansas and Oklahoma), North-central Pennsylvania and Texas. WES commenced operation of Train IV in May 2016 and Train V in October 2016, both of which are processing plants at the DBM complex. WES has also made progress payments toward the construction of another cryogenic unit at the DBM complex ( Train VI ). WES is evaluating when construction of Train VI will start and believes the earliest the plant may come online is the fourth quarter of 2017.

1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED) 
    
  Basis of presentation.   The following table outlines WES s ownership interests and the accounting method of consolidation used in WES s consolidated financial statements: 

(1)   
    Investments in non-controlled entities over which WES exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.  Equity investment throughput  refers to WES s share of average throughput for these investments. 
               (2)   
    WGP proportionately consolidates WES s associated share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses attributable to these assets. 
               (3)   
    The   25%   interest in Chipeta Processing LLC ( Chipeta ) held by a third-party member is reflected within noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements, in addition to the noncontrolling interests noted below. 
       
  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of WGP and entities in which it holds a controlling financial interest, including WES and WES GP. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
  The consolidated financial results of WES are included in WGP s consolidated financial statements due to WGP s   100%   ownership interest in WES GP and WES GP s control of WES. Throughout these notes to consolidated financial statements, and to the extent material, any differences between the consolidated financial results of WGP and WES are discussed separately. WGP has no independent operations or material assets other than its partnership interests in WES. WGP s consolidated financial statements differ from those of WES primarily as a result of (i) the presentation of noncontrolling interest ownership (attributable to the limited partner interests in WES held by the public, other subsidiaries of Anadarko and private investors, see   Note 4  ), (ii) the elimination of WES GP s investment in WES with WES GP s underlying capital account, (iii) the general and administrative expenses incurred by WGP, which are separate from, and in addition to, those incurred by WES, (iv) the inclusion of the impact of WGP equity balances and WGP distributions, and (v) WGP s senior secured revolving credit facility ( WGP RCF ). See   Note 9  .

1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED) 
    
  Variable interest entity.     Based on recently adopted guidance noted below in   Recently adopted accounting standards  , WES is a variable interest entity ( VIE ) because the partners in WES with equity at risk lack the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact WES s economic performance. A reporting entity that concludes it has a variable interest in a VIE must evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE, such that it is the VIE s primary beneficiary and should consolidate. According to the aforementioned recently adopted guidance, WGP is the primary beneficiary of WES and therefore should consolidate because (i) WGP has the power to direct the activities of WES that most significantly affect its economic performance and (ii) WGP has the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to WES. As noted above, WGP has no independent operations or material assets other than its partnership interests in WES. The assets of WES cannot be used by WGP for general partnership purposes. WES s long-term debt is recourse to WES GP (wholly owned by WGP). In turn, WES GP is indemnified by wholly owned subsidiaries of Anadarko for any claims made against WES GP under the indentures governing WES s outstanding notes or borrowings under WES s senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( WES RCF ). WES s sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operations, interest income on its   $260.0 million   note receivable from Anadarko, available borrowing capacity under the WES RCF, and issuances of additional equity or debt securities. As further discussed in   Note 2  , WGP purchased WES common units in connection with WES s financing of an acquisition from Anadarko in March 2016. 
  In preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management evaluates its estimates and related assumptions regularly, using historical experience and other methods considered reasonable. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations resulting from revisions to estimates are recognized when the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. The information furnished herein reflects all normal recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements, and certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. 
  Certain information and note disclosures commonly included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with WGP s 2015 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016, certain sections of which were recast to reflect the results of the Springfield interest in WGP s Current Report on Form 8-K, as filed with the SEC on June 10, 2016. Management believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. 
    
  Noncontrolling interests.   WGP s noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements consist of the following for all periods presented: (i) the   25%   interest in Chipeta held by a third-party member, (ii) the publicly held limited partner interests in WES, (iii) the   2,011,380   WES common units issued by WES to other subsidiaries of Anadarko as part of the consideration paid for the acquisitions of the Non-Operated Marcellus Interest, the TEFR Interests and Springfield (see   Note 2  ), (iv) the WES Class C units issued by WES to a subsidiary of Anadarko as part of the funding for the acquisition of DBM and (v) the WES Series A Preferred units issued to private investors as part of the funding of the Springfield acquisition. See   Note 2  ,   Note 3   and   Note 4  .  
  When WES issues equity, the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest reported by WGP is adjusted to reflect the noncontrolling ownership interest in WES. The resulting impact of such noncontrolling interest adjustment on WGP s interest in WES is reflected as an adjustment to WGP s partners  capital.

1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED) 
    
  Presentation of WES assets.   The term  WES assets  refers to the assets indirectly owned and interests accounted for under the equity method (see   Note 7  ) by WGP through its partnership interests in WES as of   September 30, 2016  . Because WGP owns the entire interest in and controls WES GP, and WGP GP is owned and controlled by Anadarko, each of WES s acquisitions of WES assets from Anadarko has been considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control. As such, WES assets acquired from Anadarko were initially recorded at Anadarko s historic carrying value, which did not correlate to the total acquisition price paid by WES. Further, after an acquisition of WES assets from Anadarko, WES and WGP (by virtue of its consolidation of WES) may be required to recast their financial statements to include the activities of such WES assets from the date of common control. See   Note 2  . 
  For those periods requiring recast, the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the acquisition of WES assets from Anadarko have been prepared from Anadarko s historical cost-basis accounts and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred if WES had owned the WES assets during the periods reported. Net income (loss) attributable to the WES assets acquired from Anadarko for periods prior to WES s acquisition of the WES assets is not allocated to the limited partners. 
    
  Insurance recoveries.   Involuntary conversions result from the loss of an asset because of some unforeseen event (e.g., destruction due to fire). Some of these events are insurable and result in property damage insurance recovery. Amounts that are received from insurance carriers are net of any deductibles related to the covered event. A receivable is recorded from insurance to the extent a loss is recognized from an involuntary conversion event and the likelihood of recovering such loss is deemed probable. To the extent that any insurance claim receivables are later judged not probable of recovery (e.g., due to new information), such amounts are expensed. A gain on involuntary conversion is recognized when the amount received from insurance exceeds the net book value of the retired asset(s). In addition, gains related to insurance recoveries are not recognized until all contingencies related to such proceeds have been resolved, that is, a non-refundable cash payment is received from the insurance carrier or there is a binding settlement agreement with the carrier that clearly states that a non-refundable payment will be made. To the extent that an asset is rebuilt, the associated expenditures are capitalized, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and presented as capital expenditures in the consolidated statements of cash flows. With respect to business interruption insurance claims, income is recognized only when non-refundable cash proceeds are received from insurers, which are presented in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of Operating income (loss).  
  On December 3, 2015, there was an initial fire and secondary explosion at the processing facility within the DBM complex. The majority of the damage from the incident was to the liquid handling facilities and the amine treating units at the inlet of the complex. Train II (with capacity of   100   MMcf/d) sustained the most damage of the processing trains and is expected to be returned to service by the end of 2016. Train III (with capacity of   200   MMcf/d) experienced minimal damage and returned to full service in May 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , and December 31, 2015, the consolidated balance sheets include receivables of   $28.8 million   and   $49.0 million  , respectively, for a property insurance claim related to the incident at the DBM complex. As of   September 30, 2016  , WES had received   $34.7 million   in cash proceeds from insurers related to the incident at the DBM complex, including   $16.3 million   in proceeds from business interruption insurance claims and   $18.4 million   in proceeds from property insurance claims. 
    
  Recently adopted accounting standards.   Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-06,   Earnings Per Share (Topic 260) Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions  . This ASU provides guidance for the presentation of historical earnings per unit for MLPs that apply the two-class method of calculating earnings per unit. When a general partner transfers or  drops down  net assets to an MLP, the transaction is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, and the statements of operations are adjusted retrospectively to reflect the transaction. This ASU specifies that the historical earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner, and the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners should not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. The ASU also requires additional disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method. There was no impact to WGP s consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2016.

  ASU 2015-03,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   and ASU 2015-15,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  . These ASUs require capitalized debt issuance costs, except for those related to revolving credit facilities, to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, rather than as an asset. WGP adopted these ASUs on January 1, 2016, using a retrospective approach. The adoption resulted in a reclassification that reduced Other assets and Long-term debt by   $16.7 million   on WGP s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. See   Note 9  . 
  ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810) Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . This ASU amends existing requirements applicable to reporting entities that are required to evaluate consolidation of a legal entity under the VIE or voting interest entity models. The provisions will affect how limited partnerships and similar entities are assessed for consolidation, including an additional requirement that a limited partnership will be a VIE unless the limited partners have either substantive kick-out or participating rights over the general partner. WGP has evaluated the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and determined that WES meets the criteria for a variable interest entity for which WGP is the primary beneficiary for accounting and disclosure purposes. Prior to adoption of this ASU, WES was consolidated by WGP under the voting interest model. After adoption, WES was consolidated by WGP under the variable interest model, thus the adoption of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, had no impact on WGP s consolidated financial statements. See   Basis of Presentation Variable interest entity   above. 
    
  New accounting standards issued but not yet adopted.   ASU 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740) Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory  . This ASU requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs and eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2018 and is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. WGP is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . This ASU provides clarification on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2018 and is required to be adopted using a retrospective approach if practicable, with early adoption permitted. WGP does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated statement of cash flows. 
  ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   This ASU requires the lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on the balance sheet and disclose key information about their leasing transactions. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2019. WGP is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   This ASU supersedes current revenue recognition requirements. The codification was amended through additional ASUs and, as amended, requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. WGP is required to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods. WGP is continuing to evaluate the provisions of this ASU and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures or decided upon the method of adoption.

2.  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 
    
  The following table presents the acquisitions completed by WES during   2016   and   2015  , and identifies the funding sources for such acquisitions: 

(1)   
    WES acquired Delaware Basin JV Gathering LLC ( DBJV ) from Anadarko. DBJV owns a   50%   interest in a gathering system and related facilities. The DBJV gathering system and related facilities (the  DBJV system ) are located in the Delaware Basin in Loving, Ward, Winkler and Reeves Counties, Texas. WES will make a cash payment on March 31, 2020, to Anadarko as consideration for the acquisition of DBJV. At the acquisition date, WES estimated the future payment would be   $282.8 million  , the net present value of which was   $174.3 million  . For further information, including revisions to the estimated future payment, see   DBJV acquisition deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko   below. 
               (2)   
    WES acquired Springfield Pipeline LLC ( Springfield ) from Anadarko for   $750.0 million  , consisting of   $712.5 million   in cash and the issuance of   1,253,761   of WES common units. Springfield owns a   50.1%   interest in an oil gathering system and a gas gathering system, such interest being referred to in this report as the  Springfield interest.  The Springfield oil and gas gathering systems (collectively, the  Springfield system ) are located in Dimmit, La Salle, Maverick and Webb Counties in South Texas. WES financed the cash portion of the acquisition through: (i) borrowings of   $247.5 million   on the WES RCF, (ii) the issuance of   835,841   of WES common units to WGP and (iii) the issuance of WES Series A Preferred units to private investors. See   Note 4   for further information regarding WES s Series A Preferred units. WGP financed the purchase of the WES common units by borrowing   $25.0 million   on the WGP RCF. See   Note 9  . 
       
  Springfield acquisition  .   Because the acquisition of Springfield was a transfer of net assets between entities under common control, WGP s historical financial statements and operational data previously filed with the SEC have been recast in this Form   10-Q   to include the results attributable to the Springfield interest as if WES owned Springfield for all periods presented. The consolidated financial statements for periods prior to WES s acquisition of Springfield have been prepared from Anadarko s historical cost-basis accounts and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred if WES had owned Springfield during the periods reported. 
  The following table presents the impact of the Springfield interest on Revenues and other and Net income (loss) as presented in WGP s historical consolidated statements of operations:

2.  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES (CONTINUED) 
    
  DBJV acquisition - deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko.     The consideration to be paid by WES for the acquisition of DBJV consists of a cash payment to Anadarko due on March 31, 2020. The cash payment will be equal to (a) eight multiplied by the average of WES s share in the Net Earnings (see definition below) of DBJV for the calendar years 2018 and 2019, less (b) WES s share of all capital expenditures incurred for DBJV between March 1, 2015, and February 29, 2020. Net Earnings is defined as all revenues less cost of product, operating expenses and property taxes, in each case attributable to DBJV on an accrual basis. As of the acquisition date, the estimated future payment obligation (based on management s estimate of WES s share of forecasted Net Earnings and capital expenditures for DBJV) was   $282.8 million  , which had a net present value of   $174.3 million  , using a discount rate of   10%  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , WES recognized an aggregate   $259.9 million   decrease in the estimated future payment obligation, resulting in a net present value of   $16.4 million   for this obligation at   September 30, 2016  , calculated using a discounted cash flow model with a 10% discount rate. The reduction in the value of the deferred purchase price obligation is primarily due to revisions reflecting a decrease in WES s estimate of 2018 and 2019 Net Earnings and an increase in WES s estimate of aggregate capital expenditures to be incurred by DBJV through February 29, 2020. 
  The following table summarizes the financial statement impact of the Deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko: 

(1)   
    Accretion expense was recorded as a charge to Interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
               (2)   
    Interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations includes financing-related accretion revisions of   $(1.2) million   and   $(12.1) million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
               (3)   
    Recorded as revisions within Common units on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statement of equity and partners  capital. 
       
  Assets held for sale - Hugoton system.   During the third quarter of 2016, the Hugoton system, located in Southwest Kansas and Oklahoma, satisfied criteria to be considered held for sale. The assets were remeasured to their current fair value using a market approach and Level 2 fair-value measurement, resulting in a loss of   $6.2 million   at September 30, 2016, recorded as Gain (loss) on divestiture and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2016, the consolidated balance sheet included long-term assets of   $65.6 million   and long-term liabilities of   $8.4 million   associated with assets held for sale. The sale of these assets closed on October 31, 2016.

  WGP partnership distributions.   WGP s partnership agreement requires WGP to distribute all of its available cash (as defined in its partnership agreement) to WGP unitholders of record on the applicable record date within   55   days of the end of each quarter. The Board of Directors of WGP GP declared the following cash distributions to WGP unitholders for the periods presented: 

WES partnership distributions.   WES s partnership agreement requires WES to distribute all of its available cash (as defined in WES s partnership agreement) to WES unitholders of record on the applicable record date within   45   days of the end of each quarter. The Board of Directors of WES GP declared the following cash distributions to WES s common and general partner unitholders for the periods presented: 

(1)   
    The Board of Directors of WES GP declared a cash distribution to WES unitholders for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.845   per unit, or   $166.7 million   in aggregate, including incentive distributions, but excluding distributions on WES Class C units (see   WES     Class C unit distributions   below) and WES Series A Preferred units (see   WES     Series A Preferred unit distributions   below). The cash distribution is payable on   November 10, 2016  , to WES unitholders of record at the close of business on   October 31, 2016  .

3.  PARTNERSHIP DISTRIBUTIONS (CONTINUED) 
    
  WES Class C unit distributions.   WES s Class C units receive quarterly distributions at a rate equivalent to WES s common units. The distributions are paid in the form of additional Class C units ( PIK Class C units ) until the scheduled conversion date on December 31, 2017 (unless earlier converted), and the Class C units are disregarded with respect to WES s distributions of WES s available cash until they are converted to WES common units. The number of additional PIK Class C units to be issued in connection with a distribution payable on the Class C units is determined by dividing the corresponding distribution attributable to the Class C units by the volume-weighted-average price of WES s common units for the ten days immediately preceding the payment date for the WES common unit distribution, less a   6%   discount. WES records the PIK Class C unit distributions at fair value at the time of issuance. This Level 2 fair value measurement uses WES s unit price as a significant input in the determination of the fair value. WES made distributions to APC Midstream Holdings, LLC ( AMH ), the holder of the Class C units, of (i)   214,416   PIK Class C units in August 2016, for the quarterly distribution period ended June 30, 2016, (ii)   210,562   PIK Class C units in May 2016, for the quarterly distribution period ended March 31, 2016, and (iii)   323,584   PIK Class C units in February 2016, for the quarterly distribution period ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  WES Series A Preferred unit distributions.   As further described in   Note 4  , WES issued Series A Preferred units representing limited partner interests in WES to private investors in March 2016 and April 2016. The Series A Preferred unitholders receive quarterly distributions in cash equal to   $0.68   per Series A Preferred unit, subject to certain adjustments. The holders of the WES Series A Preferred units are entitled to certain rights that are senior to the rights of holders of WES common and Class C units, such as rights to distributions and rights upon liquidation of WES. No payment or distribution on any junior equity security of WES, including WES common and Class C units, for any quarter is permitted prior to the payment in full of the WES Series A Preferred unit distribution (including any outstanding arrearages). For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the WES Series A Preferred unitholders will receive an aggregate cash distribution of   $14.9 million   (to be paid in November 2016). For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the WES Series A Preferred unitholders received an aggregate cash distribution of   $14.1 million   (paid in August 2016) comprised of a quarterly per unit distribution prorated for the   77  -day period   7,892,220   WES Series A Preferred units were outstanding during the second quarter of 2016 and a full quarterly per unit distribution on 14,030,611 Series A Preferred units. For the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the WES Series A Preferred unitholders received an aggregate cash distribution of   $1.9 million   (paid in May 2016), based on the quarterly per unit distribution prorated for the   18  -day period   14,030,611   WES Series A Preferred units were outstanding during the first quarter of 2016. See   Note 4   for further discussion of the WES Series A Preferred units.

4.  EQUITY AND PARTNERS  CAPITAL 
    
  Holdings of WGP equity.   WGP s common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  WGP.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Anadarko held   178,587,365   of WGP s common units, representing an   81.6%   limited partner interest in WGP, and, through its ownership of WGP GP, Anadarko indirectly held the entire non-economic general partner interest in WGP. The public held   40,334,938   WGP common units, representing an   18.4%   limited partner interest in WGP.  
  In June 2016, Anadarko sold   12,500,000   of its WGP common units to the public through an underwritten offering. WGP did not receive any proceeds from, or incur any expense in, the public offering. 
  In June 2015, Anadarko sold   2,300,000   of its WGP common units to the public through an underwritten offering, including   300,000   common units pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters  over-allotment option. WGP did not receive any proceeds from, or incur any expense in, the public offering. 
    
  Tangible equity units.   In June 2015, Anadarko completed the public issuance of   9,200,000  ,   7.50%   tangible equity units ( TEUs ), including   1,200,000   TEUs pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters  over-allotment option, at a price to the public of   $50.00   per TEU. Each TEU that Anadarko issued consists of (1) a prepaid equity purchase contract for WGP common units owned by Anadarko (subject to Anadarko s right to elect to deliver shares of its common stock in lieu of such WGP common units) and (2) a senior amortizing note due   June 7, 2018  . WGP did not receive any proceeds from, or incur any expense in, the public offering. See   Note 7 Tangible Equity Units   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of Anadarko s Form   10-Q   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   (which is not, and shall not be deemed to be, incorporated by reference herein), for a full discussion of the TEUs. 
    
  Net income (loss) per common unit.   For WGP, basic net income (loss) per common unit is calculated by dividing the limited partners  interest in net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common units outstanding during the period. Dilutive net income (loss) per common unit is calculated by dividing the limited partners  interest in net income (loss) adjusted for distributions on the WES Series A Preferred units and a reallocation of the limited partners  interest in net income (loss) assuming conversion of the WES Series A Preferred units into WES common units by the weighted-average number of WGP common units outstanding during the period. For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the impact of Series A Preferred units assuming conversion to WES common units would be anti-dilutive. Net income (loss) per common unit is calculated assuming that cash distributions are equal to the net income attributable to WGP. Net income (loss) attributable to the WES assets (as defined in   Note 1  ) acquired from Anadarko for periods prior to WES s acquisition of the WES assets is not allocated to the limited partners when calculating net income (loss) per common unit. Net income equal to the amount of available cash (as defined by WGP s partnership agreement) is allocated to WGP common unitholders consistent with actual cash distributions. 
    
  Holdings of WES equity.   As of   September 30, 2016  , WGP held   50,132,046   WES common units, representing a   30.0%   limited partner interest in WES, and, through its ownership of WES GP, WGP indirectly held   2,583,068   general partner units, representing a   1.5%   general partner interest in WES, and   100%   of WES s incentive distribution rights. As of   September 30, 2016  , (i) other subsidiaries of Anadarko held   2,011,380   WES common units and   12,160,424   Class C units, representing an aggregate   8.5%   limited partner interest in WES, (ii) the public held   78,528,544   WES common units, representing a   46.9%   limited partner interest in WES, and (iii) private investors held   21,922,831   WES Series A Preferred units, representing a   13.1%   limited partner interest in WES, which are all reflected as noncontrolling interests within the consolidated financial statements of WGP (see   Note 1   and   Note 2  ). 
    
  WES equity offerings.   Pursuant to WES s registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2014 authorizing the issuance of up to an aggregate of   $500.0 million   of WES common units ( $500.0 million COP ), during the year ended December 31, 2015, WES issued   873,525   common units, at an average price of   $66.61  , generating proceeds to WES of   $57.4 million   (net of   $0.8 million   for the underwriting discount and other offering expenses). Net proceeds were used for general partnership purposes, including funding capital expenditures. Gross proceeds generated during the year ended December 31, 2015, were   $58.2 million  . Commissions paid during the year ended December 31, 2015, were   $0.6 million  . WES issued   no   common units under the $500.0 million COP during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

  WES Class C units.   In connection with the closing of the DBM acquisition in November 2014, WES issued   10,913,853   Class C units to AMH at a price of   $68.72   per unit, generating proceeds of   $750.0 million  , pursuant to a Unit Purchase Agreement ( UPA ) with Anadarko and AMH. All outstanding Class C units will convert into WES common units on a one-for-one basis on December 31, 2017, unless WES elects to convert such units earlier or Anadarko extends the conversion date. The Class C units were issued to partially fund WES s acquisition of DBM, and the UPA contains an optional redemption feature that provides WES the ability to redeem up to   $150.0 million   of the Class C units within 10 days of the receipt of cash proceeds from an entity that is not an affiliate of WES or AMH, if these cash proceeds were in relation to (i) the assets of DBM, (ii) the equity interests in DBM or (iii) the equity interests in a subsidiary of WES that owns a majority of the outstanding equity interests in DBM. As of   September 30, 2016  , no such proceeds had been received, and no WES Class C units had been redeemed. 
    
  WES Series A Preferred units.   In connection with the closing of the Springfield acquisition on March 14, 2016, WES issued   14,030,611   Series A Preferred units (the  March 2016 Series A units ) to private investors for a cash purchase price of   $32.00   per unit, generating proceeds of   $440.0 million   (net of fees and expenses, including a   2.0%   transaction fee paid to the private investors). In April 2016, WES issued an additional   7,892,220   Series A Preferred units (the  April 2016 Series A units ) pursuant to the full exercise of an option granted in connection with the March 2016 Series A units issuance, generating net proceeds of   $246.9 million  . The Series A Preferred unitholders may convert the Series A Preferred units into WES common units on a   one  -for-one basis at any time after the second anniversary of the issuance date, in whole or in part, subject to certain conversion thresholds. Similarly, WES may convert the Series A Preferred units at any time after the third anniversary of the issuance date, in whole or in part, if the closing price of WES s common units is greater than   $48.00   per common unit for 20 of the 30 preceding trading days, and subject to other certain conversion thresholds. In addition, upon certain events involving a change of control, the Series A Preferred unitholders may elect on an individual basis, subject to certain conditions, to (i) convert their Series A Preferred units to WES common units at the then applicable conversion rate, (ii) if WES is not the surviving entity (or if WES is the surviving entity, but its common units will cease to be listed), require WES to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the surviving entity in any such transaction to issue a substantially equivalent security (or convert into common units based on a specified formula, if WES is unable to cause such substantially equivalent securities to be issued), (iii) if WES is the surviving entity, continue to hold their Series A Preferred units, or (iv) require WES to redeem the Series A Preferred units at a price per Series A Preferred unit of   $32.32  , plus accrued and unpaid distributions to be paid in cash or WES common units at the discretion of WES. 
  The Series A Preferred unitholders will vote on an as-converted basis with WES s common unitholders and will have certain other class voting rights with respect to any amendment to the partnership agreement that would adversely affect any rights, preferences or privileges of the Series A Preferred unitholders. In connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred units, WES entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the  Registration Rights Agreement ) with the Series A Preferred unit purchasers relating to the registered resale of the WES common units representing limited partner interests in WES issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred units. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, WES is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to file and maintain a registration statement for the resale of the converted Series A Preferred units, with such registration statement to become effective no later than March 2018.

5.  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES 
    
  Affiliate transactions.   Revenues from affiliates include amounts earned by WES from services provided to Anadarko as well as from the sale of residue and NGLs to Anadarko. In addition, WES purchases natural gas from an affiliate of Anadarko pursuant to gas purchase agreements. Operation and maintenance expense includes amounts accrued for or paid to affiliates for the operation of WES assets, whether in providing services to affiliates or to third parties, including field labor, measurement and analysis, and other disbursements. A portion of general and administrative expenses is paid by Anadarko, which results in affiliate transactions pursuant to the reimbursement provisions of the omnibus agreements of WES and WGP. Affiliate expenses do not bear a direct relationship to affiliate revenues, and third-party expenses do not bear a direct relationship to third-party revenues. See   Note 2   for further information related to contributions of assets to WES by Anadarko. 
    
  Cash management.   Anadarko operates a cash management system whereby excess cash from most of its subsidiaries  separate bank accounts is generally swept to centralized accounts. Prior to the acquisition of WES assets, third-party sales and purchases related to such assets were received or paid in cash by Anadarko within its centralized cash management system. The outstanding affiliate balances were entirely settled through an adjustment to net investment by Anadarko in connection with the acquisition of WES assets. Subsequent to the acquisition of WES assets from Anadarko, transactions related to such assets are cash-settled directly with third parties and with Anadarko affiliates. Chipeta cash settles its transactions directly with third parties and Anadarko, as well as with the other subsidiaries of WES. 
    
  Note receivable - Anadarko and Deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko.   Concurrently with the closing of WES s May 2008 initial public offering, WES loaned   $260.0 million   to Anadarko in exchange for a 30-year note bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of   6.50%  , payable quarterly. The fair value of the note receivable from Anadarko was   $308.1 million   and   $252.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and December 31,   2015  , respectively. The fair value of the note reflects consideration of credit risk and any premium or discount for the differential between the stated interest rate and quarter-end market interest rate, based on quoted market prices of similar debt instruments. Accordingly, the fair value of the note receivable from Anadarko is measured using Level 2 inputs.  
  The consideration to be paid by WES to Anadarko for the March 2015 acquisition of DBJV consists of a cash payment due on March 31, 2020. See   Note 2     and   Note 9  .

  WGP working capital facility.     On November 1, 2012, WGP entered into a   $30.0 million   working capital facility (the  WGP WCF ) with Anadarko as the lender. The WGP WCF is available exclusively to fund WGP s working capital borrowings. Borrowings under the WGP WCF will mature on   November 1, 2017  , and bear interest at London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus   1.50%  . See   Note 9  . 
    
  Commodity price swap agreements.   WES has commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko to mitigate exposure to a majority of the commodity price volatility that would otherwise be present as a result of the purchase and sale of natural gas, condensate or NGLs. Notional volumes for each of the commodity price swap agreements are not specifically defined. Instead, the commodity price swap agreements apply to the actual volume of natural gas, condensate and NGLs purchased and sold. The outstanding commodity price swap agreements for the Hugoton system, MGR assets and DJ Basin complex expire in December 2016.     The commodity price swap agreements do not satisfy the definition of a derivative financial instrument and, therefore, are not required to be measured at fair value. 
  Below is a summary of the fixed price ranges on all of WES s outstanding commodity price swap agreements as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The following table summarizes gains and losses upon settlement of commodity price swap agreements recognized in the consolidated statements of operations:

  Revenues or costs attributable to volumes settled during the respective extension period, at the applicable market price in the above tables, will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. WES will also record a capital contribution from Anadarko in its consolidated statement of equity and partners  capital for the amount by which the swap price exceeds the applicable market price in the above tables. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the capital contribution from Anadarko was   $34.8 million  .

Borrowings under the WGP RCF bear interest, at WGP s option, at either (a) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the Prime Rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus   0.50%   and (iii) LIBOR plus   1.00%  , in each case plus applicable margins ranging from   1.00%   to   1.75%   based upon WGP s consolidated leverage ratio or (b) LIBOR (with a floor of   0%  ), plus applicable margins ranging from   2.00%   to   2.75%   based upon WGP s consolidated leverage ratio. The unused portion of the WGP RCF is subject to a quarterly commitment fee ranging from   0.30%   to   0.50%   per annum on the daily unused amount of the WGP RCF based upon WGP s consolidated leverage ratio. At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate and commitment fee rate on the WGP RCF was   2.53%   and   0.30%  , respectively.

Including the effects of the issuance and underwriting discounts, the effective interest rate of the 2026 Notes is   4.787%  . Interest is paid semi-annually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Proceeds (net of underwriting discount of   $3.1 million  , original issue discount and debt issuance costs) were used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the WES RCF.  
  In October 2016, WES issued an additional   $200.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of 2044 Notes at a price to the public of   102.776%   of the face amount plus accrued interest from October 1, 2016 to the settlement date. These notes were offered as additional notes under the indenture governing the 2044 Notes issued in March 2014 and are treated as a single class of securities with the 2044 Notes under such indenture. Proceeds (net of underwriting discount of   $1.8 million   and debt issuance costs and excluding accrued interest from October 1, 2016 to the settlement date) were used to repay amounts then outstanding under the WES RCF. The remaining proceeds will be used for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures.

  Interest rate agreements.   In June 2016, WES entered into a U.S. Treasury rate lock agreement to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates on existing variable-rate debt expected to be refinanced during the third quarter of 2016. The rate lock agreement was not designated as a cash flow hedge and was settled in June 2016 upon the offering of the WES 2026 Notes that closed in July 2016. WES realized a loss of   $0.2 million   at settlement, which is included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
    
  We were formed by Anadarko in September 2012 by converting WGR Holdings, LLC into an MLP and changing its name to Western Gas Equity Partners, LP. We closed our IPO in December 2012 and own WES GP and a significant limited partner interest in WES, a growth-oriented Delaware MLP formed by Anadarko to acquire, own, develop and operate midstream energy assets. Our consolidated financial statements include the consolidated financial results of WES due to our 100% ownership interest in WES GP and WES GP s control of WES. Our only cash-generating assets consist of our partnership interests in WES, and we currently have no independent operations. 
  WES currently owns or has investments in assets located in the Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Utah and Wyoming), the Mid-Continent (Kansas and Oklahoma), North-central Pennsylvania and Texas, and is engaged in the business of gathering, processing, compressing, treating and transporting natural gas, condensate, NGLs and crude oil for Anadarko, as well as for third-party producers and customers. As of   September 30, 2016  , WES s assets and investments accounted for under the equity method consisted of the following:

Significant financial and operational events during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , included the following: 

WES completed the acquisition of Springfield from Anadarko for cash and WES common unit consideration totaling $750.0 million. See   Acquisitions and Divestitures   below. 

In May 2016, WES commenced operation of Train IV, a 200 MMcf/d processing plant at the DBM complex. 

WES completed the offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes in July 2016. Net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the WES RCF. See   Liquidity and Capital Resources   within this Item 2 for additional information. 

WES raised its distribution to   $0.845   per unit for the   third   quarter of   2016  , representing a   2%     increase   over the distribution for the   second   quarter of 2016 and a   9%     increase   over the distribution for the   third   quarter of   2015  . 

Throughput attributable to WES for natural gas assets totaled   4,070   MMcf/d and   3,908   MMcf/d for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, representing   no   change and an   8%     decrease  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . 

Throughput for crude/NGL assets totaled   185   MBbls/d for both the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , representing a   3%   and   1%     decrease  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  .

     Table of Contents  

Adjusted gross margin attributable to WES for natural gas assets (as defined under the caption   Key Performance Metrics   within this   Item 2  ) averaged   $0.82   per Mcf for both the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , representing an   11%   and   12%     increase  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . 

Adjusted gross margin for crude/NGL assets (as defined under the caption   Key Performance Metrics   within this   Item 2  ) averaged   $2.20   per Bbl and   $2.10   per Bbl for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, representing a   15%   and   8%     increase  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   2015  . 
       
  Significant Item Affecting Comparability.   On December 3, 2015, there was an initial fire and secondary explosion at the processing facility within the DBM complex. The majority of the damage was to the liquid handling facilities and the amine treating units at the inlet of the complex. Train II (with capacity of 100 MMcf/d) sustained the most damage of the processing trains and is expected to be returned to service by the end of 2016. Train III (with capacity of 200 MMcf/d) experienced minimal damage and returned to full service in May 2016. For ease of reference throughout the remainder of this Management s Discussion and Analysis, the damage to the processing facility and resulting lack of processing capacity and associated financial statement impact will be referred to as the  DBM outage.  See   Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 
    
  Acquisitions.   The following table presents the acquisitions completed by WES during   2016   and   2015  , and identifies the funding sources for such acquisitions. See   Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures     in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 

(1)   
    WES acquired DBJV from Anadarko. DBJV owns a   50%   interest in the DBJV system. WES will make a cash payment on March 31, 2020, to Anadarko as consideration for the acquisition of DBJV. At the acquisition date, WES estimated the future payment would be   $282.8 million  , the net present value of which was   $174.3 million  . For further information, including revisions to the estimated future payment, see   Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures     in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
               (2)   
    WES acquired Springfield from Anadarko for $750.0 million, consisting of $712.5 million in cash and the issuance of 1,253,761 of WES common units. Springfield owns a 50.1% interest in the Springfield system. WES financed the cash portion of the acquisition through: (i) borrowings of   $247.5 million   on the WES RCF, (ii) the issuance of   835,841   of WES common units to WGP and (iii) the issuance of WES Series A Preferred units to private investors. See   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for a discussion of WES s Series A Preferred units. WGP financed the purchase of the WES common units by borrowing   $25.0 million   on the WGP RCF. See   Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
       
  Assets held for sale - Hugoton system.   During the third quarter of 2016, the Hugoton system, located in Southwest Kansas and Oklahoma, satisfied criteria to be considered held for sale. The assets were remeasured to their current fair value using a market approach and Level 2 fair-value measurement, resulting in a loss of   $6.2 million   at September 30, 2016, recorded as Gain (loss) on divestiture and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2016, the consolidated balance sheet included long-term assets of   $65.6 million   and long-term liabilities of   $8.4 million   associated with assets held for sale. The sale of these assets closed on October 31, 2016.

Presentation of WES assets.     The term  WES assets  refers to the assets indirectly owned and interests accounted for under the equity method by us through our partnership interests in WES as of   September 30, 2016  . See   Note 7 Equity Investments   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . Because Anadarko controls WES through its ownership and control of us, and because we own the entire interest in WES GP, each of WES s acquisitions of WES assets from Anadarko has been considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control. As such, WES assets acquired from Anadarko were initially recorded at Anadarko s historic carrying value, which did not correlate to the total acquisition price paid by WES. See   Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . Further, after an acquisition of WES assets from Anadarko, we (by virtue of our consolidation of WES) and WES may be required to recast our financial statements to include the activities of such WES assets from the date of common control. 
  WGP s historical financial statements and operational data previously filed with the SEC have been recast in this Form   10-Q   to include the results attributable to the Springfield interest as if WES owned Springfield for all periods presented. The consolidated financial statements for periods prior to WES s acquisition of Springfield have been prepared from Anadarko s historical cost-basis accounts and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred if WES had owned Springfield during the periods reported. 

EQUITY OFFERINGS 
    
  Public equity offerings.   In June 2016, Anadarko sold   12,500,000   of its WGP common units to the public through an underwritten offering. WGP did not receive any proceeds from, or incur any expense in, the public offering. 
  In June 2015, Anadarko sold 2,300,000 of its WGP common units to the public through an underwritten offering, including 300,000 common units pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters  over-allotment option. WGP did not receive any proceeds from, or incur any expense in, the public offering. 
    
  Tangible equity units.   In June 2015, Anadarko completed the public issuance of   9,200,000  ,   7.50%   TEUs, including   1,200,000   TEUs pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters  over-allotment option, at a price to the public of   $50.00   per TEU. Each TEU that Anadarko issued consists of (1) a prepaid equity purchase contract for WGP common units owned by Anadarko (subject to Anadarko s right to elect to deliver shares of its common stock in lieu of such WGP common units) and (2) a senior amortizing note due June 7, 2018. WGP did not receive any proceeds from, or incur any expense in, the public offering. See   Note 7 Tangible Equity Units   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of Anadarko s Form   10-Q   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   (which is not, and shall not be deemed to be, incorporated by reference herein), for a full discussion of the TEUs. 
    
  WES equity offerings.   Pursuant to WES s $500.0 million COP, during the year ended December 31, 2015, WES issued   873,525   common units, at an average price of   $66.61  , generating proceeds to WES of   $57.4 million   (net of   $0.8 million   for the underwriting discount and other offering expenses), which were used for general partnership purposes, including funding capital expenditures. Gross proceeds generated during the year ended December 31, 2015, were   $58.2 million  . Commissions paid during the year ended December 31, 2015, were   $0.6 million  . WES issued   no   common units under the $500.0 million COP during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Other WES equity offerings.   In March 2016, WES issued the March 2016 Series A units to private investors for a cash purchase price of $32.00 per unit, generating proceeds of $440.0 million (net of fees and expenses, including a 2.0% transaction fee paid to the private investors), which were used to fund a portion of the Springfield acquisition. In April 2016, WES issued the April 2016 Series A units pursuant to the full exercise of an option granted in connection with the March 2016 Series A units issuance, generating net proceeds of   $246.9 million  , which were used to pay down amounts borrowed under the WES RCF in connection with the Springfield acquisition. See   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   and   Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  .

ITEMS AFFECTING THE COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS 
    
  Our consolidated financial statements include the consolidated financial results of WES due to our 100% ownership interest in WES GP and WES GP s control of WES. Our only cash-generating assets consist of our partnership interests in WES, and we currently have no independent operations. As a result, our results of operations do not differ materially from the results of operations and cash flows of WES, which are reconciled below. 
    
  General and administrative expenses.   As a separate publicly traded partnership, we incur general and administrative expenses which are separate from, and in addition to, those incurred by WES. 
  The following table summarizes the amounts we reimbursed to Anadarko, separate from, and in addition to, those reimbursed by WES: 

Noncontrolling interests.   The interest in Chipeta held by a third-party member is already reflected as a noncontrolling interest in WES s consolidated financial statements. In addition, the limited partner interests in WES held by other subsidiaries of Anadarko, private investors and the public are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements (see   Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for further information). 
  When WES issues equity, the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest reported by WGP is adjusted to reflect the noncontrolling ownership interest in WES. The resulting impact of such noncontrolling interest adjustment on WGP s interest in WES is reflected as an adjustment to WGP s partners  capital. 
    
  Distributions.   Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement) within   55   days after the end of each quarter. Our only cash-generating assets are our partnership interests in WES, consisting of general partner units, common units and incentive distribution rights, on which we expect to receive quarterly distributions from WES. Our cash flow and resulting ability to make cash distributions are therefore completely dependent upon WES s ability to make cash distributions with respect to our partnership interests in WES. Generally, our available cash is our cash on hand at the end of a quarter after the payment of our expenses and the establishment of cash reserves and cash on hand resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter. 
    
  Western Gas Equity Partners, LP 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan.   Concurrently with the WGP IPO, WGP GP adopted the WGP LTIP. Equity-based compensation expense attributable to grants made under the WGP LTIP impacts cash flows from operating activities only to the extent cash payments are made to a participant in lieu of issuance of WGP common units to the participant. See   Note 5 Transactions with Affiliates   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for further information.

     Table of Contents  

WGP RCF.   In March 2016, we entered into a   $250.0 million   WGP RCF which matures in March 2019. The WGP RCF may be used to buy WES common units and for general partnership purposes.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate and commitment fee rate on the WGP RCF was   2.53%   and   0.30%  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $28.0 million   of outstanding borrowings (  $222.0 million   available borrowing capacity) and were in compliance with all covenants under the WGP RCF. See   Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for further information. 
    
  WGP WCF.   On November 1, 2012, we entered into the WGP WCF, a $30.0 million working capital facility with Anadarko as the lender. The facility is available exclusively to fund our working capital borrowings. Borrowings under the facility will mature on November 1, 2017, and bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%. The interest rate was   2.03%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  We are required to reduce all borrowings under the WGP WCF to zero for a period of at least 15 consecutive days during the twelve month period commencing on November 1 of each year. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   outstanding borrowings under the WGP WCF and   $30.0 million   available for borrowing. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants under the WGP WCF. 
    
  Reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP to net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Equity Partners, LP.   The differences between net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP and net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Equity Partners, LP are reconciled as follows:

Private investors held WES Series A Preferred units representing an additional   13.1%   limited partner interest in WES as of   September 30, 2016  . Other subsidiaries of Anadarko separately held an   8.5%   and 8.4% limited partner interest in WES as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. See   Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  .

  Natural gas assets 
    
  Gathering, treating and transportation throughput   decrease  d by   142   MMcf/d for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to decreased throughput at the Bison facility due to volumes being diverted to a third-party treater, the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015, and production declines in the area around the Springfield gas gathering system. These decreases were partially offset by higher throughput at the DBJV system due to increased production in West Texas and increased throughput at the Anadarko-Operated and Non-Operated Marcellus Interest systems due to previously modulated volumes being brought online. 
  Gathering, treating and transportation throughput decreased by 306 MMcf/d for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015 and decreased throughput at the Bison facility due to volumes being diverted to a third-party treater.  
  Processing throughput   increase  d by   121   MMcf/d for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to increased production in the areas around the DJ Basin complex and the May 2016 start-up of Train IV at the DBM complex. These increases were partially offset by decreased throughput at the Chipeta complex due to decreased drilling activity in the Uinta Basin and production declines in the areas around the MGR assets and Granger complex. Processing throughput   decrease  d by   50   MMcf/d for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the decreases noted above for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as well as to decreases attributable to the DBM outage.  
  Equity investment throughput   increase  d by   7   MMcf/d for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to volumes being diverted from the third-party Bison pipeline to the Fort Union system, which was partially offset by a decrease in volumes at the Rendezvous system due to production declines in the Jonah and Pinedale Anticline fields. 
    
  Crude/NGL assets 
    
  Gathering, treating and transportation throughput   decrease  d by   8   MBbls/d and   13   MBbls/d for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to decreased throughput at the Springfield oil gathering system. Equity investment throughput   increase  d by   12   MBbls/d for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in volumes on FRP as a result of increased production in the DJ Basin area.

Gathering, Processing and Transportation Revenues 

Revenues from gathering, processing and transportation   increase  d by   $32.2 million   and   $66.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to increases of $26.1 million and $93.9 million, respectively, at the DJ Basin complex resulting from increased throughput and a higher processing fee. In addition, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, there was an increase of $10.0 million at the DBM complex due to increased throughput and a higher processing fee. These increases were partially offset by decreases during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , of (i) $2.5 million and $17.6 million, respectively, due to the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015 and (ii) $5.6 million and $15.8 million, respectively, at the Springfield system due to decreased throughput.

The increase in NGLs sales of   $4.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to an increase of $12.9 million at the DBM complex due to an increase in average price and volumes sold. This increase was partially offset by decreases of (i) $7.6 million at the MGR assets due to a decrease in volumes sold and (ii) $1.9 million at the DJ Basin complex due to a decrease in the market prices associated with WES s above-market swap extensions, which was partially offset by an increase in volumes sold. 
  The decline in NGLs sales of   $69.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was primarily due to decreases of (i) $28.6 million at the MGR assets due to a decrease in volumes sold, (ii) $20.6 million due to the DBM outage, (iii) $6.4 million at the Hilight system due to a decrease in volumes sold and average price and (iv) $7.1 million and $4.2 million at the DJ Basin complex and Hugoton system, respectively, due to the partial equity treatment of WES s above-market swap extensions beginning July 1, 2015 for the DJ Basin complex and October 1, 2015 for the Hugoton system, which was partially offset by an increase in volumes sold at the DJ Basin complex. 

Equity Income, Net   Affiliates   

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , equity income, net   affiliates   decrease  d by   $1.7 million  , primarily due to a decrease in equity income at the Fort Union system and TEFR Interests. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , equity income, net   affiliates   decrease  d by   $2.3 million  , primarily due to WES s 14.81% share of an impairment loss determined by the managing partner of Fort Union, partially offset by increases in equity income from the TEFR Interests due to increased volumes.

General and Administrative, Depreciation and Amortization, Impairments and Other Expenses 

General and administrative ex  pens  es   increase  d by   $1.2 million   and   $2.9 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to increases in personnel costs for which WES reimbursed Anadarko pursuant to the WES omnibus agreement. 
  Property and other taxes   increase  d by   $1.6 million   and   $5.2 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to ad valorem tax increases at the DJ Basin and DBM complexes. The increase for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was partially offset by an ad valorem tax decrease of $1.5 million due to the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015. 
  Depreciation and amortization   decrease  d by   $0.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to depreciation expense decreases of (i) $2.9 million at the Hilight system due to an asset impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 and (ii) $0.6 million due to the Hugoton system being classified as held for sale in the third quarter of 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $3.2 million related to capital projects at the DBM complex and the DBJV and Non-Operated Marcellus Interest systems. 
  Depreciation and amortization   decrease  d by   $5.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to depreciation expense decreases of (i) $12.5 million at the MGR assets and the Hilight system due to asset impairments recognized in the first and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively, (ii) $7.0 million due to the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015 and (iii) $1.1 million due to the Hugoton system being classified as held for sale in the third quarter of 2016.

Income Tax (Benefit) Expense   

WES is not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, WES s income apportionable to Texas is subject to Texas margin tax. For the periods presented, the variance from the federal statutory rate, which is zero percent as a non-taxable entity, is primarily due to federal and state taxes on pre-acquisition income attributable to the WES assets acquired from Anadarko, and WES s share of Texas margin tax. 
  Income attributable to (i) the Springfield system prior to and including February 2016 and (ii) the DBJV system prior to and including February 2015, was subject to federal and state income tax. Income earned on the Springfield system and the DBJV system for periods subsequent to February 2016 and February 2015, respectively, was only subject to Texas margin tax on income apportionable to Texas.

KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS 

(1)   
    Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets is calculated as total revenues and other for natural gas assets, less reimbursements for electricity-related expenses recorded as revenue and cost of product for natural gas assets, plus distributions from WES s equity investments in Fort Union and Rendezvous, and excluding the noncontrolling interest owner s proportionate share of revenue and cost of product. See the reconciliation of Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets to its most comparable GAAP measure below. 
               (2)   
    Adjusted gross margin for crude/NGL assets is calculated as total revenues and other for crude/NGL assets, less reimbursements for electricity-related expenses recorded as revenue and cost of product for crude/NGL assets, plus distributions from WES s equity investments in White Cliffs, the Mont Belvieu JV, and the TEFR Interests. See the reconciliation of Adjusted gross margin for crude/NGL assets to its most comparable GAAP measure below. 
               (3)   
    For a reconciliation of Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP, Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP and Distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the descriptions below. 
               (4)   
    Average for period. Calculated as Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets, divided by total throughput (MMcf/d) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets. 
               (5)   
    Average for period. Calculated as Adjusted gross margin for crude/NGL assets, divided by total throughput (MBbls/d) for crude/NGL assets. 
       
  Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP.   WES defines Adjusted gross margin attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP ( Adjusted gross margin ) as total revenues and other, less cost of product and reimbursements for electricity-related expenses recorded as revenue, plus distributions from equity investees and excluding the noncontrolling interest owner s proportionate share of revenue and cost of product. WES believes Adjusted gross margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of its operations, as well as its operating performance as compared to that of other companies in the industry. 
  Adjusted gross margin   increase  d by   $32.8 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in volumes at the DJ Basin complex and the start-up of Train IV within the DBM complex in May 2016, partially offset by lower volumes at the Springfield system and the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015. Adjusted gross margin increased by   $43.9 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in volumes at the DJ Basin complex, partially offset by lower volumes due to the DBM outage, lower volumes at the Springfield system, the sale of the Dew and Pinnacle systems in July 2015, and lower volumes at the MGR assets and the Chipeta complex.  
  To facilitate investor and industry analyst comparisons between WES and its peers, WES also discloses   Adjusted gross margin per Mcf attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets   and   Adjusted gross margin per Bbl for crude/NGL assets  . Adjusted gross margin per Mcf attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP for natural gas assets   increase  d by   $0.08   and   $0.09   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to increased production in the DJ Basin and the start-up of Lancaster Train II in June 2015 (within the DJ Basin complex). Adjusted gross margin per Bbl for crude/NGL assets   increase  d by   $0.28   and   $0.16   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to higher distributions received from the Mont Belvieu JV and TEP.

Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP.   WES defines Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP ( Adjusted EBITDA ) as net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP, plus distributions from equity investees, non-cash equity-based compensation expense, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments, and other expense (including lower of cost or market inventory adjustments recorded in cost of product), less gain (loss) on divestiture and other, net, income from equity investments, interest income, income tax benefit, and other income. WES believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing its financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that WES s management and external users of WES s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, commercial banks and rating agencies, use to assess the following, among other measures: 

WES s operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; 

the ability of WES s assets to generate cash flow to make distributions; and 

the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
       
  Adjusted EBITDA   increase  d by   $57.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a   $49.1 million     increase   in total revenues and other, a   $14.0 million     decrease   in operation and maintenance expenses,   $13.7 million   in proceeds from business interruption insurance claims and a   $1.7 million     increase   in distributions from equity investees. These amounts were partially offset by a   $17.9 million     increase   in cost of product and a   $1.6 million     increase   in property and other tax expense. 
  Adjusted EBITDA   increase  d by   $73.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an   $87.4 million     decrease   in cost of product, a   $16.6 million     decrease   in operation and maintenance expenses,   $16.3 million   in proceeds from business interruption insurance claims and a   $3.2 million     increase   in distributions from equity investees. These amounts were partially offset by a   $42.1 million     decrease   in total revenues and other, a   $5.2 million     increase   in property and other tax expense and a   $2.3 million     increase   in general and administrative expenses excluding non-cash equity-based compensation expense. 
    
  Distributable cash flow.   WES defines  Distributable cash flow  as Adjusted EBITDA, plus interest income and the net settlement amounts from the sale and/or purchase of natural gas, condensate and NGLs under WES s commodity price swap agreements to the extent such amounts are not recognized as Adjusted EBITDA, less net cash paid (or to be paid) for interest expense (including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs originally paid in cash, offset by non-cash capitalized interest), maintenance capital expenditures, Series A Preferred unit distributions and income taxes. WES compares Distributable cash flow to the cash distributions WES expects to pay its unitholders. Using this measure, WES s management can quickly compute the Coverage ratio of distributable cash flow to planned cash distributions. WES believes Distributable cash flow is useful to investors because this measurement is used by many companies, analysts and others in the industry as a performance measurement tool to evaluate WES s operating and financial performance and compare it with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships. See   Note 5 Transactions with Affiliates   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for a discussion of WES s swap extensions at the DJ Basin complex and the Hugoton system. 
  While Distributable cash flow is a measure WES uses to assess its ability to make distributions to its unitholders, it should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that WES has available for distributions or that it plans to distribute for a given period. Furthermore, to the extent Distributable cash flow includes realized amounts recorded as capital contributions from Anadarko attributable to activity under WES s commodity price swap agreements, Distributable cash flow is not a reflection of WES s ability to generate cash from operations.

     Table of Contents  

Distributable cash flow   increase  d by   $47.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to   increase  s of   $57.5 million   in Adjusted EBITDA and   $10.5 million   in the above-market component of the swap extensions with Anadarko. These amounts were partially offset by distributions of   $14.9 million   on Series A Preferred units issued in 2016 and a   $4.8 million     increase   in net cash paid for interest expense. 
  Distributable cash flow   increase  d by   $41.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an   increase   of   $73.6 million   in Adjusted EBITDA and   $26.9 million   in the above-market component of the swap extensions with Anadarko, where such amount related to the above-market component of swaps did not exist prior to the extensions executed on July 1, 2015. These amounts were partially offset by distributions of   $30.9 million   on Series A Preferred units issued in 2016, a   $14.5 million     increase   in cash paid for maintenance capital expenditures and a   $13.2 million     increase   in net cash paid for interest expense. 

Reconciliation to non-GAAP measures.     Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow are not defined in GAAP. The GAAP measure used by WES that is most directly comparable to Adjusted gross margin is operating income (loss), while net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP and net cash provided by operating activities are the GAAP measures used by WES that are most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. The GAAP measure used by WES that is most directly comparable to Distributable cash flow is net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP. WES s non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to the GAAP measures of operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Western Gas Partners, LP, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect operating income (loss), net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of WES s results as reported under GAAP. WES s definitions of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in WES s industry, thereby diminishing their utility. 
  WES s management compensates for the limitations of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow compared to (as applicable) operating income (loss), net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. WES believes that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that its management uses in evaluating its operating results.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  WES s primary cash requirements are for acquisitions and capital expenditures, debt service, customary operating expenses, quarterly distributions to its limited partners and to WES GP, and distributions to its noncontrolling interest owner. WES s sources of liquidity as of   September 30, 2016  , included cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operations, interest income on WES s   $260.0 million   note receivable from Anadarko, available borrowing capacity under the WES RCF, and issuances of additional equity or debt securities. WES believes that cash flows generated from these sources will be sufficient to satisfy its short-term working capital requirements and long-term maintenance and expansion capital expenditure requirements. The amount of future distributions to unitholders will depend on its results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors, including the extension of commodity price swap agreements, and will be determined by WES GP s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Due to WES s cash distribution policy, WES expects to rely on external financing sources, including equity and debt issuances, to fund expansion capital expenditures and future acquisitions. However, to limit interest expense, WES may use operating cash flows to fund expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions, which could result in subsequent borrowings under the WES RCF to pay distributions or fund other short-term working capital requirements. 
  WES has filed an insurance claim for the incident at the DBM complex and is currently in the adjusting process with insurers. Recoveries from the business interruption claim related to the DBM outage are recognized as income when non-refundable cash proceeds are received from insurers. As of   September 30, 2016  , WES had received   $34.7 million   in cash proceeds from insurers related to the incident at the DBM complex, including   $16.3 million   in proceeds from business interruption insurance claims and   $18.4 million   in proceeds from property insurance claims (see   Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  ). 
  WES has made cash distributions to its unitholders each quarter since its IPO and has increased its quarterly distribution each quarter since the second quarter of 2009. The Board of Directors of WES GP declared a cash distribution to WES unitholders for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.845   per unit, or   $166.7 million   in aggregate, including incentive distributions, but excluding distributions on WES s Class C units and Series A Preferred units. The cash distribution is payable on   November 10, 2016  , to WES unitholders of record at the close of business on   October 31, 2016  . In connection with the closing of the DBM acquisition in November 2014, WES issued Class C units that will receive distributions in the form of additional Class C units until the end of 2017, unless earlier converted (see   Note 3 Partnership Distributions   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  ). The Class C unit distribution, if paid in cash, would have been   $10.3 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  . In connection with the closing of the Springfield acquisition in March 2016, WES issued the March 2016 Series A units, and in April 2016, WES issued the April 2016 Series A units pursuant to the full exercise of the option granted in connection with the March 2016 Series A units issuance. These WES Series A Preferred units will receive quarterly distributions in cash equal to $0.68 per Series A Preferred unit, subject to certain adjustments. See   Note 3 Partnership Distributions   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the WES Series A Preferred unitholders will receive an aggregate cash distribution of   $14.9 million  , payable in   November 2016  .  
  WES s management continuously monitors its leverage position and coordinates its capital expenditure program, quarterly distributions and acquisition strategy with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule. WES s management will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including additional borrowings and the issuance of debt or equity securities, to secure funds as needed or to refinance outstanding debt balances with longer term notes. To facilitate a potential debt or equity securities issuance, WES has the ability to sell securities under its shelf registration statements. WES s ability to generate cash flows is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond its control. Read   Risk Factors   under Part II, Item 1A of this Form   10-Q  .

Working capital  .   As of   September 30, 2016  , WES had   $113.4 million   of working capital, which it defines as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. Working capital includes the estimated property insurance receivable related to the DBM outage. See   Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . Working capital is an indication of liquidity and potential need for short-term funding. Working capital requirements are driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable and factors such as credit extended to, and the timing of collections from, WES s customers, and the level and timing of its spending for maintenance and expansion activity. As of   September 30, 2016  , WES had   $1.18 billion   available for borrowing under the WES RCF. In addition, we have   $30.0 million   available for borrowing under the WGP WCF and   $222.0 million   available for borrowing under the WGP RCF. See   Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 

Capital expenditures  .   WES s business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain and improve existing facilities or develop new midstream infrastructure. WES categorizes capital expenditures as either of the following:  

maintenance capital expenditures, which include those expenditures required to maintain the existing operating capacity and service capability of WES s assets, such as to replace system components and equipment that have been subject to significant use over time, become obsolete or reached the end of their useful lives, to remain in compliance with regulatory or legal requirements or to complete additional well connections to maintain existing system throughput and related cash flows (for fiscal year 2016, WES GP s Board of Directors has approved Estimated Maintenance Capital Expenditures (as defined in WES s partnership agreement) of $17.7 million per quarter); or 

expansion capital expenditures, which include expenditures to construct new midstream infrastructure and those expenditures incurred to extend the useful lives of WES s assets, reduce costs, increase revenues or increase system throughput or capacity from current levels, including well connections that increase existing system throughput. 
       
  Capital expenditures in the consolidated statements of cash flows reflect capital expenditures on a cash basis, when payments are made. Capital incurred is presented on an accrual basis. WES s capital expenditures as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows and capital incurred were as follows: 

(1)   
    Maintenance capital expenditures for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are presented net of   $4.9 million   and   zero  , respectively, of contributions in aid of construction costs from affiliates. Capital expenditures for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , included $32.5 million of pre-acquisition capital expenditures for the Springfield system. 
               (2)   
    Includes the noncontrolling interest owner s share of Chipeta s capital expenditures for all periods presented. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , included   $4.7 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively, of capitalized interest. 
               (3)   
    Capital incurred for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , included $29.2 million of pre-acquisition capital incurred for the Springfield system. 
       
  Acquisitions during 2016 included Springfield and equipment purchases from Anadarko. Acquisitions during 2015 included equipment purchases from Anadarko and the post-closing purchase price adjustments related to the DBM acquisition. See   Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures   and   Note 5 Transactions with Affiliates   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  .

Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions,   decrease  d by   $138.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Expansion capital expenditures   decrease  d by   $152.3 million   (including a   $2.2 million     decrease   in capitalized interest) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a decrease of $179.5 million at the DJ Basin complex as a result of decreased activity in 2016. In addition, there were decreases of $34.0 million at the Non-Operated Marcellus Interest systems, $27.4 million at the Springfield system, $16.3 million at the Hilight system, and $9.2 million at the Anadarko-Operated Marcellus Interest systems. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $110.2 million due to continued construction at the DBM complex and an increase of $22.7 million at the DBJV system. Maintenance capital expenditures   increase  d by   $14.2 million  , primarily due to an increase at the DBM complex, partially offset by decreased expenditures at the Non-Operated Marcellus Interest and Springfield systems and the DJ Basin complex. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, WES updated its estimated total capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2016, (including its 75% share of Chipeta s capital expenditures and equity investments, but excluding acquisitions) from an originally reported $450 million to $490 million, to a range of $490 million to $530 million.

Debt and credit facility.   At   September 30, 2016  , WES s debt consisted of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, $670.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes, $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2044 Notes, $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes and   $20.0 million   of borrowings outstanding under the WES RCF. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of WES s outstanding debt was   $2.9 billion  . See   Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
    
  WES Senior Notes  . At   September 30, 2016  , WES was in compliance with all covenants under the indentures governing its outstanding notes. 
  The 2026 Notes issued in July 2016 were offered at a price to the public of   99.796%   of the face amount. Including the effects of the issuance and underwriting discounts, the effective interest rate of the 2026 Notes is   4.787%  . Interest is paid semi-annually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Proceeds (net of underwriting discount of   $3.1 million  , original issue discount and debt issuance costs) were used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the WES RCF.  
  In October 2016, WES issued an additional   $200.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of 2044 Notes at a price to the public of   102.776%   of the face amount plus accrued interest from October 1, 2016 to the settlement date. These notes were offered as additional notes under the indenture governing the 2044 Notes issued in March 2014 and are treated as a single class of securities with the 2044 Notes under such indenture. Proceeds (net of underwriting discount of   $1.8 million   and debt issuance costs and excluding accrued interest from October 1, 2016 to the settlement date) were used to repay amounts then outstanding under the WES RCF. The remaining proceeds will be used for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures. 
    
  WES RCF.   As of   September 30, 2016  , WES had   $20.0 million   of outstanding borrowings,   $4.9 million   in outstanding letters of credit and   $1.18 billion   available for borrowing under the WES RCF, which matures in February 2019. At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the WES RCF was   1.82%  , the facility fee rate was   0.20%   and WES was in compliance with all covenants under the WES RCF. 
  In April 2016, WES repaid $250.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the WES RCF, $246.9 million of which was funded with the proceeds from the issuance of the April 2016 Series A units. See   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . Additionally, in July 2016, WES repaid $540.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the WES RCF, primarily with the proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes. In October 2016, WES repaid $20.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the WES RCF, with the proceeds from the offering of the new notes issued in October 2016. 
    
  Interest rate agreements.     In June 2016, WES entered into a U.S. Treasury rate lock agreement to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates on existing variable-rate debt expected to be refinanced during the third quarter of 2016. The rate lock agreement was not designated as a cash flow hedge and was settled in June 2016 upon the offering of the WES 2026 Notes that closed in July 2016. WES realized a loss of   $0.2 million   at settlement, which is included in Other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Deferred purchase price obligation - Anadarko.     The consideration to be paid by WES for the acquisition of DBJV consists of a cash payment to Anadarko due on March 31, 2020. The cash payment will be equal to (a) eight multiplied by the average of WES s share in the Net Earnings (see definition below) of DBJV for the calendar years 2018 and 2019, less (b) WES s share of all capital expenditures incurred for DBJV between March 1, 2015, and February 29, 2020. Net Earnings is defined as all revenues less cost of product, operating expenses and property taxes, in each case attributable to DBJV on an accrual basis. As of the acquisition date, the estimated future payment obligation (based on management s estimate of WES s share of forecasted Net Earnings and capital expenditures for DBJV) was   $282.8 million  , which had a net present value of   $174.3 million  , using a discount rate of   10%  . During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , WES recognized an aggregate   $259.9 million   decrease in the estimated future payment obligation, resulting in a net present value of   $16.4 million   for this obligation at September 30, 2016, calculated using a discounted cash flow model with a 10% discount rate. The reduction in the value of the deferred purchase price obligation is primarily due to revisions reflecting a decrease in WES s estimate of 2018 and 2019 Net Earnings and an increase in WES s estimate of aggregate capital expenditures to be incurred by DBJV through February 29, 2020. The accretion revision, which was recorded as a reduction to Interest expense, was   $1.2 million   and   $12.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. Accretion expense was $4.3 million and $9.9 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. See   Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
    
  Securities  .   WES may issue an indeterminate amount of common units and various debt securities under its effective shelf registration statements on file with the SEC. WES may issue common units under its $500.0 million COP, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of WES s offerings. As of   September 30, 2016  , WES had the capacity to issue additional common units with an aggregate sales price of up to $441.8 million under the $500.0 million COP. See   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for a discussion of trades completed by WES under its $500.0 million COP. 
  In March 2016, in connection with the issuance of the March 2016 Series A units, WES entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Series A Preferred unit purchasers, pursuant to which WES agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to file and maintain a registration statement with respect to the resale of WES common units that are issuable upon conversion of the WES Series A Preferred units. See   Note 4 Equity and Partners  Capital   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q   for a discussion of the WES Series A Preferred units. 

Credit risk  .   As stated above, our assets consist solely of ownership interests in WES. Accordingly, we are dependent upon WES s ability to pay cash distributions to us. WES bears credit risk represented by its exposure to non-payment or non-performance by its counterparties, including Anadarko, financial institutions, customers and other parties. Generally, non-payment or non-performance results from a customer s inability to satisfy payables to WES for services rendered or volumes owed pursuant to gas imbalance agreements. WES examines and monitors the creditworthiness of third-party customers and may establish credit limits for third-party customers. 
  WES is dependent upon a single producer, Anadarko, for a majority of its volumes (excluding equity investment throughput), and WES does not maintain a credit limit with respect to Anadarko. Consequently, WES is subject to the risk of non-payment or late payment by Anadarko for gathering, processing and transportation fees and for proceeds from the sale of residue, NGLs and condensate to Anadarko. 
  
   57 

     Table of Contents  

WES expects its exposure to concentrated risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue for as long as it remains substantially dependent on Anadarko for its revenues. Additionally, WES is exposed to credit risk on the note receivable from Anadarko. WES is also party to agreements with Anadarko under which Anadarko is required to indemnify WES for certain environmental claims, losses arising from rights-of-way claims, failures to obtain required consents or governmental permits and income taxes with respect to the assets acquired from Anadarko. Finally, WES has entered into various commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko in order to reduce its exposure to a majority of the commodity price risk inherent in its percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts, and is subject to performance risk thereunder. See   Note 5 Transactions with Affiliates   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
  WES s ability to make distributions to its unitholders may be adversely impacted if Anadarko becomes unable to perform under the terms of its gathering, processing and transportation agreements, natural gas and NGL purchase agreements, Anadarko s note payable to WES, the WES omnibus agreement, the services and secondment agreement, contribution agreements or the commodity price swap agreements. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
    
  WES s contractual obligations include, among other things, a revolving credit facility, other third-party long-term debt, capital obligations related to its expansion projects and various operating leases. Refer to     Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense   and   Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for an update to WES s contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  , including, but not limited to, increases in committed capital. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. WES does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and standby letters of credit. The information pertaining to operating leases and WES s standby letters of credit required for this item is provided under   Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies   and   Note 9 Debt and Interest Expense  , respectively, included in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  .

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Commodity price risk.   Certain of WES s processing services are provided under percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole agreements in which Anadarko is typically responsible for the marketing of the natural gas, condensate and NGLs. Under percent-of-proceeds agreements, WES receives a specified percentage of the net proceeds from the sale of residue and/or NGLs. Under keep-whole agreements, WES keeps 100% of the NGLs produced, and the processed natural gas, or value of the natural gas, is returned to the producer. Since some of the gas is used and removed during processing, WES compensates the producer for the amount of gas used and removed in processing by supplying additional gas or by paying an agreed-upon value for the gas used. 
  To mitigate WES s exposure to a majority of the changes in commodity prices as a result of the purchase and sale of natural gas, condensate or NGLs, WES currently has in place commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko expiring in December 2016. On June 25, 2015, WES extended its commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko for the DJ Basin complex from July 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, and for the Hugoton system from October 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015. On December 8, 2015, the DJ Basin complex and Hugoton system swaps were further extended from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. See   Note 5 Transactions with Affiliates   in the   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   under   Part I  ,   Item 1   of this Form   10-Q  . 
  We consider WES s exposure to commodity price risk associated with the above-described arrangements to be minimal given the existence of the commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko and the relatively small amount of WES s operating income (loss) that is impacted by changes in market prices. Accordingly, WES does not expect a 10% increase or decrease in natural gas or NGL prices would have a material impact on WES s operating income (loss), financial condition or cash flows for the next twelve months, excluding the effect of natural gas imbalances described below. 
  We bear a limited degree of commodity price risk through our investment in WES with respect to settlement of WES s natural gas imbalances that arise from differences in gas volumes received into WES s systems and gas volumes delivered by WES to customers, as well as instances where WES s actual liquids recovery or fuel usage varies from the contractually stipulated amounts. Natural gas volumes owed to or by WES that are subject to monthly cash settlement are valued according to the terms of the contract as of the balance sheet dates, and generally reflect market index prices. Other natural gas volumes owed to or by WES are valued at WES s weighted-average cost of natural gas as of the balance sheet dates and are settled in-kind. WES s exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices on outstanding imbalances depends on the timing of settlement of the imbalances. 
    
  Interest rate risk.   Interest rates during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were low compared to historic rates. In December 2015, while raising the target range for the federal funds rate from zero to between 1/4 to 1/2 percent, the Federal Open Market Committee signaled that further increases are likely over the medium term. Any such increases in the federal funds rate will ultimately result in an increase in our and WES s financing costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , WGP had   no   outstanding borrowings under the WGP WCF,   $28.0 million   of borrowings under the WGP RCF and WES had   $20.0 million   of outstanding borrowings under the WES RCF. The WGP WCF, WGP RCF and WES RCF all bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR or, in the case of the WGP RCF and WES RCF, an alternative base rate at WGP s or WES s option, respectively. A 10% change in LIBOR would have resulted in a nominal change in net income (loss) and the fair value of any borrowings under the WES RCF, WGP WCF and WGP RCF at   September 30, 2016  .  
  Additional variable-rate debt may be incurred in the future, either under the WES RCF, WGP WCF, WGP RCF or other financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings or debt issuances.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  .   The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of WGP s general partner (for purposes of this Item 4,  Management ) performed an evaluation of WGP s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, Management has concluded that WGP s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Remediation Plan.   As disclosed in Management s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Part II, Item 8 of WGP s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016, as of December 31, 2015, Management determined that a material weakness (as defined in the regulations of the SEC) existed in WGP s internal control over financial reporting. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, WGP, subject to senior management review, began remediating this material weakness by, among other things, implementing a training program for the personnel involved in the impairment determination processes and controls to ensure business understanding and the proper application of GAAP and WGP s accounting policies related to the impairment of long-lived assets. During the second quarter of 2016, WGP completed these remediation activities by testing the operating effectiveness of the aforementioned efforts and found them to be effective. As a result, Management has concluded that the material weakness had been remediated as of June 30, 2016. As WGP continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, Management may execute additional measures to address the material weakness or modify the remediation plan described above and will continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of WGP s internal controls. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  .   There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, WGP s internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
    
  WGR Operating, LP, one of WES s subsidiaries, is currently in negotiations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with respect to alleged non-compliance with the leak detection and repair requirements of the federal Clean Air Act at its Granger, Wyoming facility. Although WES s management cannot predict the outcome of settlement discussions, management believes that it is reasonably likely a resolution of this matter will result in a fine or penalty in excess of $100,000. 
  We are not engaged in any material litigation. Except as discussed above, WES is not a party to any legal, regulatory or administrative proceedings other than proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. WES s management believes that there are no such proceedings for which a final disposition could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or for which disclosure is otherwise required by Item 103 of Regulation S-K.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors included below, as well as those set forth under Part I, Item 1A in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , together with all of the other information included in this document, and in our other public filings, press releases and public discussions with management. Additionally, for a full discussion of the risks associated with Anadarko s business, see Item 1A under Part I in Anadarko s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , Anadarko s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and Anadarko s other public filings, press releases and public discussions with Anadarko management. We have identified these risk factors as important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. 
    
  New pipeline safety legislation could result in more stringent requirements on WES s gas pipelines and gathering lines, which could trigger significant capital costs and costs of operation. 
    
  On June 22, 2016, President Obama signed new pipeline safety legislation, the  Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016  (the  PIPES Act ), just recently passed by Congress. Extending the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration s ( PHMSA ) statutory mandate through 2019, the PIPES Act establishes or continues the development of requirements affecting pipeline safety including, but not limited to, the following: (i) providing PHMSA with additional authority to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing; (ii) obligating PHMSA to develop safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 22, 2018; and (iii) requiring PHMSA to complete certain of the outstanding mandates under existing legislation and to report to Congress on the status of overdue rulemakings. The development and/or implementation of more stringent requirements pursuant to the PIPES Act could cause WES to incur increased capital costs and costs of operation as necessary to comply with such standards, which costs could be significant. 
    
  The holders of WES Series A Preferred units have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, holders of WES common units, and could dilute or otherwise adversely affect the holders of WES common units. 
    
  The holders of WES Series A Preferred units, first issued in March 2016, are entitled to certain rights that are senior to the rights of holders of WES common and Class C units, such as rights to distributions and rights upon liquidation of WES. No payment or distribution on any junior equity security of WES, including WES common and Class C units, for any quarter is permitted prior to the payment in full of the WES Series A Preferred unit distribution (including any outstanding arrearages). These preferences could adversely affect the market price for WES s common units, or could make it more difficult for WES to issue and sell common units in the future.  
  In addition, distributions on the WES Series A Preferred units accrue and are cumulative, at a quarterly rate of $0.68 per unit, and the WES Series A Preferred units are convertible into WES common units by the holders or by WES in certain circumstances. WES s obligation to pay distributions on the WES Series A Preferred units, or on the WES common units issued following the conversion of the WES Series A Preferred units, could impact WES s liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions and other general partnership purposes. WES s obligations to the holders of WES Series A Preferred units could also limit its ability to obtain additional financing or increase its borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on WES s financial condition. 
  In addition, the holders of WES Series A Preferred units may convert the Series A Preferred units into WES common units on a one-for-one basis at any time after the second anniversary of the issuance date, in whole or in part, subject to certain conversion thresholds. Similarly, WES may convert the WES Series A Preferred units at any time after the third anniversary of the issuance date, in whole or in part, subject to certain conversion thresholds. If a substantial portion of the WES Series A Preferred units are converted into WES common units, WES common unitholders could experience significant dilution. Further, if holders of converted WES Series A Preferred units dispose of a substantial portion of such WES common units in the public market, whether in a single transaction or series of transactions, it could adversely affect the market price for WES common units. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could make it more difficult for WES to sell its common units in the future.

Proposed rule changes regarding gas pipeline safety could impose more stringent standards on WES s gas pipelines and gathering lines that, if adopted, may result in increased significant capital costs and costs of operation. 
    
  On March 17, 2016, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ( PHMSA ) announced a proposed rulemaking that would, if adopted, impose more stringent requirements for certain gas lines and gathering lines under varying circumstances. Among other things, the proposed rulemaking would extend certain of PHMSA s current regulatory safety programs for gas pipelines beyond  high consequence areas  to newly defined  moderate consequence areas  that contain as few as 5 dwellings within the potential impact area; require gas pipelines installed before 1970 and thus  grandfathered,  or excluded, from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures ( MAOP  and require gathering lines in Class I areas, both onshore and offshore, to comply with standards regarding damage prevention, corrosion control (for metallic pipe), public education, MAOP limits, line markers and emergency planning if such gathering lines  nominal design is 8 inches or more. In order to provide clarity and greater certainty on what may constitute a  gathering line,  PHMSA is proposing a new definition of that term under the rulemaking, which term would now encompass  a pipeline, or a connected series of pipelines, and equipment used to collect gas from the endpoint of a production facility/operation and transport it to the furthermost point downstream of the following endpoints  including the  inlet of 1st gas processing plant;  the  outlet of  a gas treatment facility (not associated with a processing plant or compressor station); the  [o]utlet of the furthermost downstream compressor  leading to a pipeline; or the  point where separate production fields are commingled.  Other new requirements proposed by PHMSA under the rulemaking would require pipeline operators to: report to PHMSA in the event of certain MAOP exceedances; strengthen PHMSA integrity management requirements; consider seismicity in evaluating threats to a pipeline; conduct hydrostatic testing for all pipeline segments manufactured using longitudinal seam welds; and use more detailed guidance from PHMSA in the selection of assessment methods to inspect pipelines. Adoption of some or all of these standards under the proposed rulemaking could cause WES to incur increased capital costs and costs of operation, which costs could be significant. 
    
  Our general partner may mortgage, pledge or grant a security interest in our assets without prior approval of our unitholders and Anadarko may similarly mortgage, pledge or grant a security interest in its assets, including its ownership interest in us. 
    
  In March 2016, we entered into the WGP RCF, under which we granted the lenders party thereto a security interest in substantially all of our assets. If we are unable to satisfy our obligation to repay amounts outstanding under the WGP RCF, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets. Foreclosure upon, and any resulting sale of, such assets by the lenders would adversely affect our ability to pay distributions and could adversely affect the price of our common units and WES common units and result in our loss of control of WES.  
  Further, Anadarko may mortgage, pledge or grant a security interest in any of its assets, including its general and limited partner interest in us. If Anadarko at any time were to decide to secure any of its obligations or indebtedness with some or all of its ownership interests in us, and if Anadarko were to be unable to satisfy such obligations or repay such indebtedness, the lenders could seek to foreclose on those assets. The lenders could also sell those assets under such foreclosure or other realization upon those encumbrances without prior approval of our unitholders, which would adversely affect the price of our common units and could result in Anadarko s loss of control of us and WES.
