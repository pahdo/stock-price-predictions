1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

offering and trading artwork. For the period from September 17, 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2012, there were no operations
except the issuance of shares for subscription receivable. We generate revenue from our services in connection with the offering
and trading of artwork on our system, primarily consisting of listing fees, trading commissions, and management fees. We conduct
our business primarily in Hong Kong, People s Republic of China.

REVERSE MERGER   

On October 20, 2014, Cardigant Medical
Inc. (or  Cardigant ) acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Hong Kong Takung, a privately held Hong Kong
corporation, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement and Hong Kong Takung became the wholly owned subsidiary of Cardigant in
a reverse merger, or the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Hong Kong Takung common stock
were converted, at an exchange ratio of 10.4988-for-1, into an aggregate of 8,399,040 (209,976,000 pre-reverse split) shares of
Cardigant common stock and Hong Kong Takung became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardigant. The holders of Cardigant s common
stock as of immediately prior to the Merger held an aggregate of 933,227 (23,330,662 pre-reverse split) shares of Cardigant s
common stock, The accompanying financial statements share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect
the exchange ratio in the Merger. Subsequent to the Merger, Cardigant s name was changed from  Cardigant Medical Inc. 
to  Takung Art Co., Ltd.  

Under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, ( U.S. GAAP ) because Hong Kong Takung s former stockholders
received the greater portion of the voting rights in the combined entity and Hong Kong Takung s senior management represents
all of the senior management of the combined entity, the Merger was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange,
wherein Hong Kong Takung is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities
of Hong Kong Takung have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized. Accordingly, the assets
and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in Hong Kong Takung's consolidated financial statements are those
of Hong Kong Takung and are recorded at the historical cost basis of Hong Kong Takung. 

6   

Unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires, references to  the Company  refer to Takung Art Co., Ltd. Disclosures relating to the
pre-merger business of Takung, unless noted as being the business of Cardigant prior to the Merger, pertain to the business of Takung
prior to the Merger. The Company is currently trading on the OTC market with the ticker  TKAT . 

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements as of September 30, 2016, 2015 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been
prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information
and disclosures, which are normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to provide for fair
presentation. The interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and the notes thereto
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, previously filed with
the SEC. 

This basis of accounting involves the
application of accrual accounting and consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned, and expenses and losses are
recognized when incurred. The Company s financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the Company s consolidated financial
position as of September 30, 2016, its consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been made. The interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the operating
results for the full fiscal year or any future periods. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those results. 

Principles of consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Takung Art, Co., and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. 

Reverse stock split  

On August 10, 2015, the Company s
board of directors and a majority of the Company s shareholders approved a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding
shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-25. 

Upon filing of the Certificate of Amendment,
every twenty-five shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock were automatically converted into one issued
and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share. All references made to share or per share amounts
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the
1-for-25 reverse stock split. 

7   

Fair Value Measurements  

The Company applies
the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements , for fair value measurements of financial
assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of non-financial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements.  ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. 

Fair value is
defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities
required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it
would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 

ASC 820 establishes
a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of
the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1 inputs
                                         to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities
                                         in active markets.   

Level 2 inputs
                                         to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
                                         in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either
                                         directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.   

Level 3 inputs
                                         to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.   

There were no assets or liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. 

Comprehensive Income  

Recognized revenue, expenses, gains and
losses are included in net income or loss. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities are reported as separate components
of the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet, such items, along with net income or loss, are components of comprehensive
income or loss. The components of other comprehensive income or loss are consisted solely of foreign currency translation adjustments,
net of the income tax effect. 

Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction  

The functional currency of the Hong Kong Takung and Shanghai
Takung are the Hong Kong Dollar ( HKD ). 

The functional currency of Tianjin Takung is the Renminbi ( RMB ). 

The reporting currency of the Company is the United States
Dollar ( USD ). 

8   

Transactions in currencies other than
the entity s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the
end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the end
of the reporting periods. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and on re-translation of monetary items
at period-end are included in income statement of the period. 

For the purpose of presenting these financial
statements, the Company s assets and liabilities with functional currency of HKD are expressed in USD at the exchange rates
on the balance sheet dates, which are 7.7555 and 7.7507 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively; stockholder s
equity accounts are translated at historical rates, and income and expense items are translated at the weighted average exchange
rates during the years, which are 7.7635 and 7.7530 for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. For Renminbi
currency, the Company s assets and liabilities are expressed in USD at the exchange rate on the balance sheet dates, which
are 6.6685 and 6.4778 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015; stockholder s equity accounts are translated at historical
rates, and income and expense items are translated at the weighted average exchange rates during the years, which are 6.5785 and
6.2477 for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The resulting translation adjustments
are reported under accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders  equity section of the balance sheets. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company s cash and cash equivalents amounted to $16,831,035 and $10,769,456, respectively. All of the Company s
cash deposits are held in the financial institutions located in Hong Kong and China where there are currently regulations mandated
on obligatory insurance of bank accounts. 

Restricted Cash  

Restricted cash represents the cash deposited
by the traders ( buyers and sellers ) into a specific bank account under Takung ( the broker s account )
in order to facilitate the trading ownership units of the artwork. The buyers are required to have their funds transferred to
the broker s account before the trading take place. Upon the delivery of the ownership units, the seller can send instructions
to the bank, requesting the amount to be transferred to their personal accounts. After deducting the commission and the management
fee as per Takung s instruction, the bank will transfer the remainder to the seller s personal account. Except for
instructing the bank to deduct the commission and management fee, Takung has no right to manipulate any funds in the broker s
account except the Company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits. The whole process was monitored and approved
by a third party accounting firm. Restricted cash amounted to $25,448,772 which includes $10,497,113 deposits with a 7-day maturity
date with principal guaranteed by Bank of China, and $16,195,289 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Short-term investments  

Short term investments consist of held-to-maturity investments
and available-for-sale investments. 

The Company s held-to-maturity investments
consist of financial products purchased from banks, which are not allowed for the early withdrawal. The Company s short
term held-to-maturity investments are classified as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets based on their contractual
maturity dates which are less than one year and are stated at their amortized costs. 

Investments classified as available-for-sale investments are
carried at their fair values and the unrealized gains or losses from the changes in fair values are reported net of tax in accumulated
other comprehensive income until realized. 

The Company reviews its investments for
other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) based on the specific identification method. The Company considers available
quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds
the investment s fair value, the Company considers, among other factors, general market conditions, expected future performance
of the investees, the duration and the extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than the cost, and the Company s
intent and ability to hold the investment. OTTI is recognized as a loss in the income statement. 

Accounts Receivables and Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts  

Accounts receivables are recorded and
carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. The Company makes estimates
for the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical, experience, the age
of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may
affect customers' ability to pay. 

Loan receivables  

Loan to third
party is presented under current asset of the balance sheets based on the nature and loan period of time. 

Other Non-current Assets  

A portion of
the other assets, such as prepayments and deposits, are presented under the non-current section of the balance sheets based on
the nature of the amounts. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Gains or losses on dispositions of property
and equipment are included in other income. Major additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs
are expensed as incurred. 

Depreciation
and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method from the time the assets
are placed in service. Estimated useful lives are as follows, taking into account the assets' estimated residual value: 

9   

Classification   
       
       Estimated   
      useful life    

Furniture, fixtures and equipment  
       
      5 years   

Leasehold improvements  
       
      Shorter of the remaining lease terms or the estimated
    3 years   

Computer trading and clearing system  
       
      5 years   

Long-lived Assets  

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
When these events occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of these long-lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of
the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition.
If the future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment equal
to the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of these assets. 

No impairments were recorded during the
periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Intangible Assets  

Intangible assets represent the licensing
cost for our trademark registration. For intangible assets with indefinite lives, the Company evaluates intangible assets for
impairment at least annually and more often whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not
be recoverable. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying
value exceeds the fair value. The Company has not recorded impairment of intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. 

Customer deposits  

Customer deposits represents the cash
deposited by the traders ( buyers and sellers ) into a specific bank account under Takung ( the broker s
account ) in order to facilitate the trading ownership units of the artwork. The buyers are required to have their funds
transferred to the broker s account before the trading takes place. Customer deposits were $25,448,772 and $16,195,289 as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Advance from customers  

Advance from customers represent trading
commissions one month in advance charge to the VIP traders. Starting from April 1, 2016, the Company charges a monthly commission
to VIP traders, instead of charging per transaction. 

Short-term borrowings from third parties  

The Company made two short-term borrowings
from third parties, both with 8% annual interest rate and due on December 31, 2016. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company generates
revenue from its services in connection with the offering and trading of artwork on our system, primarily consisting of listing
fees, trading commissions, and management fees. 

We recognize revenue
once all of the following criteria have been met: 

persuasive evidence
                                         of an arrangement exists;   

delivery of
                                         our obligations to our customer has occurred;   

10   

the price is
                                         fixed or determinable; and   

collectability
                                         of the related receivable is reasonably assured   

Listing fee    The Company
collects a listing fee once the ownership shares of the artwork are listed and successfully traded on the Company s system,
based on the agreed percentage of the total offering price. The listing fee revenue is collected from either the money raised
from the issuance of such shares, or separately at a pre-determined amount. When the ownership shares of the artwork is listed
and starts trading on the Company s system, the Original Owner and/or the Offering Agent shall pay the Company a one-time
offering fee and a listing deposit. The offering fee is determined based on many factors, such as the type of artwork and the
offering size. The Company generally charges approximately 22.5-48.5% of the total offering price for calligraphies, paintings
and jewelry, which are the major types of artwork listed and traded on the Company s system as of September 30, 2016. Listing
fee revenue was $2,968,534 and $439,811 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $8,166,072 and
$1,549,587 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Commission    The Company
charges trading commissions for the purchase and sale of the ownership shares of the artworks. The commission is typically 0.3%
of the total amount of each transaction, but as an initial promotion, we currently charge a reduced fee of 0.2% (resulting in
an aggregate of 0.4%) of the total transaction amount with the minimum charge of $0.13 (HK$1). The commission is accounted for
as revenue and immediately deducted from the proceeds from the sales of artwork units when a transaction is completed. 

Commission rebate programs are offered
to the traders and service agents. As part of the referral incentive program, the Company would rebate 15% of the commission earned
from the transactions of new traders referred by the existing traders. In addition, the Company rebates 40% to 60% to the service
agents when they bring in the agreed number of traders to the trading platform. Such commission rebate is recognized as reduction
of the commission revenue. Commission rebated program is also offered to VIP traders , when their trading volumes of certain artworks
reach an agreed level each month, a contractually determined flat rate of trading commission was applied to the transactions of
these certain artworks. Any trading commission charges incurred by the VIP traders over the flat rate would be waived and deducted
from the commission revenue. Starting from April 1, 2016, the Company charges a fixed monthly commission based on class of certain
artwork to VIP traders, instead of charging per transaction. 

Commission revenue (net of applicable
rebates and discounts) was $1,669,698 and $2,239,526 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
$3,739,958 and $3,267,516 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Management fee    The Company
charges management fees for covering the insurance, storage, and transportation for an artwork and trading management of artwork
units, which are calculated at $0.0013 (HK$0.01) per 100 artwork ownership units per day. The management fee is accounted for
as revenue, and immediately deducted from the proceeds from the sales of artwork ownership units when a transaction is completed.
Management fee revenue was $781,219 and $26,889 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1,341,294
and $98,674 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Annual fee income    The Company
charges an annual fee for providing traders with premium services, including more in-depth information and tools, on the trading
platform. This revenue is recognized ratably over the service agreement period. Annual fee income was $440 and $162 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $869 and $1,591 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 

Authorized agent subscription revenue
   The Company charges an authorized agent subscription fee which is an annual service fee paid by authorized agents
to grant them the right to bring their network of artwork owners to list their artwork on our trading platform. This revenue is
recognized ratably over the annual agreement period. 

11   

Cost of Revenue  

Cost of revenue consists primarily of
expenses associated with the delivery the Company s service. These include expenses related to the operation of data centers,
such as facility and lease of the server equipment, development and maintenance of the Company s platform system, as well
as the cost of insurance, storage and transportation of the artworks. Cost of revenue was $285,252 and $214,530 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $822,735 and $592,342 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes
using an asset and liability approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood
of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net
tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than
not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is
uncertain. 

Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized
as a benefit only if it is  more likely than not  that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with
a tax examination being presumed to occur. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine
whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related
appeals or litigations based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets
the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position
is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first
subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not
criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met. Penalties
and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred. GAAP also
provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. 

There are uncertain tax positions regarding
whether the income of Hong Kong Takung should be deemed as the taxable income of Shanghai Takung under the law of the People's
Republic of China on Enterprise Income Tax ( EIT ) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Such income will
be subject to EIT with 25% tax rate once it is deemed as the taxable income of Shanghai Takung and Tianjin Takung; otherwise it
is subject to Hong Kong's Profits Tax with 16.5% tax rate. 

The Company currently recognizes such
income as taxable income under Hong Kong's Profits Tax rather than taxable income under EIT, and the Company holds that it is
more-likely-than-not that this tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals
or litigations based on the technical merits of that position. 

The Company did not have any interest
and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of the Company s consolidated
statements of operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company does not expect that its assessment
regarding unrecognized tax positions will materially change over the next 12 months. 

Earnings
per share  

Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share
is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding
during the period. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively, there were options, which would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share. 

12   

Concentration
of Risks  

Concentration
of credit risk 

Financial instruments
that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash, short-term investments, deposits, accounts receivables, prepayment and other current assets. The Company places its cash
and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments with financial institutions with high-credit ratings and quality.
Accounts receivables primarily comprise of amounts receivables from the trader customers. With respect to the prepayment to service
suppliers, the Company performs on-going credit evaluations of the financial condition of these suppliers. The Company establishes
an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon estimates, factors surrounding the credit risk of specific service providers and
other information. 

Concentration
of customers 

There are no revenues from customers that
individually represent greater than 10% of the total revenues during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
and also during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Reclassifications  

Certain amounts in the 2015 financial
statements may have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously
reported results of operations or retained earnings. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Revenue recognition 

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing
revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or
services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods
or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment
and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP, including identifying
performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and
allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us in our first quarter
of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect
certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying
ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU 2014-09.
We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of our pending adoption of Topic 606. 

13   

Disclosure of Going Concern Uncertainties 

In August 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15), to provide guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating whether there
is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
ASU 2014-15 is effective for us in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the impact
of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company s financial statements will be material. 

Financial Instrument 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities  ( ASU 2016-01 ). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation,
and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective for us on September 1, 2018.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-2 ), which provides guidance on lease amendments to the FASB Accounting
Standard Codification. This ASU will be effective for us beginning in May 1, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of
evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-2 on the Company consolidated financial statements. 

Stock-based Compensation 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09). ASU
2016-09 changes how companies account for certain aspects of stock-based awards to employees, including the accounting for income
taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU
2016-09 is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, and earlier adoption is permitted. We are still evaluating the effect
that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): The amendments in this Update require a financial asset (or a group of financial
assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The amendments broaden the
information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively
or individually. The use of forecasted information incorporates more timely information in the estimate of expected credit loss,
which will be more decision useful to users of the financial statements. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is allowed as of the fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is still evaluating
the effect that this guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Statement of Cash Flows 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): The amendments in this Update apply to all entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit entities
that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the
following eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they provide guidance for each of
the eight issues, thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice described above. ASU 2016-15 is effective
for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is still evaluating the effect that this guidance
will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Except for the ASU above, in the period
from January 1, 2016 to November 6, 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-01 through ASU 2016-17, which are not expected to have
a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at a ratio of 1-for-25 (the  Reverse Stock Split ).
Upon filing of the Certificate of Amendment, every twenty-five shares of the Company s issued and outstanding Common Stock
were automatically converted into one issued and outstanding share of Common Stock, without any change in par value per share.
No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive
a fractional share will be entitled to rounding up their fractional shares to the nearest whole number. Prior period consolidated
financial statement is adjusted to reflect the impact of the one-for-twenty five reverse stock split. 

On August 26, 2015, the 2015 Incentive
Stock Plan ( 2015 Plan ) was approved by the Board of Directors for rewarding the Company s directors, executives
and selected employees and consultants for making major contributions to the success of the Company. 1,037,000 shares were registered
on August 27, 2015. 

On November 16, 2015, we entered into
various subscription agreements with and sold to the selling stockholders a total of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a price
of $1.58 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,580,000 (the  Private Placements ). The shares were offered
and sold without registration under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D and/or Rule 903 of Regulation S promulgated there under. No commissions
were paid by the Company in connection with the Private Placements.

a Consulting Agreement with Regeneration for the provision of certain consulting and advisory services, including without limitation,
assisting in the preparation of Company financial projections, business plans, executive summaries and website, and recruiting
qualified directors and officers. In consideration for providing such services, the Company issued to Regeneration the Compensation
Shares which are placed in an escrow account maintained with the Company s attorneys until either (i) the Company has successfully
listed its securities on the NASDAQ or other U.S. securities exchange on or before December 31, 2016, whereupon the Compensation
Shares shall be forthwith delivered to Regeneration or (ii) if the Company is unsuccessful in listing its securities on the NASDAQ
or other U.S. securities exchange on or before December 31, 2016, the Compensation Shares shall be returned to the Company for
cancellation. Regeneration shall be entitled to  piggy-back  registration rights with respect to the Compensation
Shares. The Compensation Shares were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act. The stock-based compensation related to this consulting agreement was $76,613 and $571,266 during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016. Pursuant to ASC 505-50-30, this transaction was measured based on the fair value of the equity instruments
issued as the Company determined that the fair value of the equity instruments issued in a share-based payment transaction with
nonemployees was more reliably measurable than the fair value of the consideration received. The Company would measure the fair
value of the equity instruments in these transactions using the stock price and other measurement assumptions on the date at which
the Regeneration s performance is complete. The Company recognized (as appropriate relative to the periods and manner that
Company would recognize cash payments under the same arrangement) the cost of the appropriate number of the 487,000 shares at
the current fair value as of November 20, 2015, and subsequently each financial reporting date until Regeneration has completed
its performance.

OVERVIEW  

We were incorporated
in Delaware under the name Cardigant Medical Inc. on April 17, 2009. Our initial business plan was to focus on the development
of novel biologic and peptide based compounds and enhanced methods for local delivery for the treatment of vascular disease including
peripheral artery disease and ischemic stroke. 

Pursuant to the Stock
Purchase Agreement dated as of July 31, 2014, Yong Li, an individual purchased a total of 887,409 restricted shares of common
stock of the Company from a group of three former shareholders of the Company. In consideration for the shares, Mr. Li paid the
sellers $399,344 in cash which came from his own capital. The sellers were Jerett A. Creed, the Company s former Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, director and formerly a controlling shareholder of the Company, the Creed Family Limited Partnership
and Ralph Sinibaldi. The shares represented approximately 95% of the Company s then issued and outstanding common stock.
The sale was consummated on August 28, 2014. As a result of the transaction, there was a change in control of the Company. 

On August 27, 2014,
we entered into a Contribution Agreement with Cardigant Neurovascular. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, we assigned all
our assets, properties, rights, title and interest used or held for use by our business, (except for certain excluded assets set
forth therein) which was the treatment of atherosclerosis and plaque stabilization in both the coronary and peripheral vasculature
using systemic and local delivery of large molecule therapeutics and peptide mimetics based on high density lipoprotein targets
( Business ). In consideration for such contribution of capital, Cardigant Neurovascular agreed to assume all our
liabilities raising from the Business prior to the date of the Contribution Agreement and thereafter with regard to certain contributed
contacts. We granted Cardigant Neurovascular an exclusive option for a period of 6 months to purchase the excluded assets for
$1. Cardigant Neurovascular exercised this option October 20, 2014 and the excluded assets were assigned to Cardigant Neurovascular
on October 20, 2014. 

Also on October 20,
2014, we acquired the business of Hong Kong Takung Assets and Equity of Artworks Exchange Co., Ltd ( Hong Kong Takung )
through the acquisition of all the share capital of Hong Kong Takung under a Share Exchange Agreement dated September 23, 2014
in exchange for 8,339,040 newly-issued restricted shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Hong Kong Takung. 

22   

Hong Kong Takung is
a limited liability company incorporated on September 17, 2012 under the laws of Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China.
Although Hong Kong Takung was incorporated in late 2012, it did not commence business operations until late 2013. 

As a result of the
transfer of the excluded assets pursuant to the Contribution Agreement and the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares
of Hong Kong Takung, we are no longer conducting the Business and have now assumed Hong Kong Takung s business operations
as it is now our only operating wholly-owned subsidiary. 

Hong Kong Takung operates
an electronic online platform located at www.takungae.com for artists, art dealers and art investors to offer and trade in valuable
artwork. 

Through Hong Kong
Takung, we offer on-line listing and trading services that allow artists/art dealers/owners to access a much bigger art trading
market where they can engage with a wide range of investors that they might not encounter without our platform. Our platform also
makes investment in high-end and expensive artwork more accessible to ordinary people without substantial financial resources. 

We generate revenue
from our services in connection with the offering and trading of artwork on our system, primarily consisting of listing fees,
trading commissions, management fees and authorized agent subscription. 

We conduct our business
primarily in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, People s Republic of China. Our principal executive offices are located
at Flat/RM 03-04, 20/F, Hutchison House, 10 Harcourt Road, Central Hong Kong. 

On July 28, 2015,
Hong Kong Takung incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Takung (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. ( Shanghai Takung ), in Shanghai
Free-Trade Zone (SFTZ) in Shanghai, China, with a registered capital of $1 million. Shanghai Takung is engaged in providing services
to its parent company Hong Kong Takung by receiving deposits from and making payments to online artwork traders for and on behalf
of Hong Kong Takung. 

On January 27, 2016,
Hong Kong Takung incorporated another subsidiary, Takung Cultural Development (Tianjin) Co., Ltd ( Tianjin Takung ),
a limited liability company, with a registered capital of $1 million in Tianjin Pilot Free Trade Zone in Tianjin, People s
Republic of China. Tianjin Takung provides technology development services to Hong Kong Takung and Shanghai Takung, and also carries
out marketing and promotion activities in mainland China. 

Since July 28, 2016,
we have expanded access to our trading platform to residents of Russia, Mongolia, Australia and New Zealand   our first
major expansion of operations outside of China. To further stimulate trading interest, we have added selected portfolios from
these countries to our platform, which now numbers 157 artworks including three Russian painting portfolios and fourteen Mongolian
paintings.

The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the three and nine month
period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and related notes thereto.

THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER
30, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015.  

Revenue 

The following tables
set forth our consolidated statements of income data: 

The following tables
set forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): 

Listing fee revenue
was $2,968,534 and $439,811; commission revenue was $1,669,698 and $2,239,526; gross management fee revenue was $781,219 and $26,889;
annual fee revenue was $440 and $162; authorized agent subscription revenue was $322,318 and nil for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Since the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company has received one more revenue stream in the form
of authorized agent subscriptions, with the contribution of $322,318 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, there were seven pieces of painting, seven pieces of amber, fourteen pieces of precious stone, and five
pieces of jewelry successfully listed on our system. The total listing values were $1,803,310 (HK$14,000,000) for the paintings,
$2,975,462 (HK$23,100,000) for the amber, $1,043,344 (HK$8,100,000) for the precious stones, $747,086 (HK$5,800,000) for the jewelry,
of which 47.75%-48% (for the seven pieces of painting), 46% (for the seven pieces of amber), 32%-48.5% (for the fourteen pieces
of precious stones), 29%-48% (for the five pieces of jewelry) of the listed values were charged as listing fees, respectively. 

Compared to the corresponding
period ended September 30, 2015, there were seven pieces of precious stones and three pieces of amber listed on our system. The
total listing values were $180,620 (HK$1,400,000) for all the precious stones and $812,792 (HK$6,300,000) for the ambers, of which
32% and 47% were charged as listing fee revenue, respectively. 

The increase in number
of pieces listed, listing values and corresponding listing fees charged during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to three months ended September 30, 2015 resulted in an increase in listing fee revenue in the current period. 

24   

During the three months
period ended September 30, 2016, commission revenue decreased due to the increase of percentage of commission rebate to traders. 

Our trading volume
and transaction amounts increased significantly during three months ended September 30, 2016. Trading amount and trading volume
increased by 266% and 476% respectively during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding period
in 2015. Shanghai Takung contributed 57% of the total trading volume, and 32% of the total trading amount and the significant
decrease of our commission revenue by $569,828 was caused by the change of percentage of commission rebate .  

During the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016, management fee revenue increased by $754,330, from $26,889, for the three months ended September
30, 2015 to $781,219 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, due to the aforementioned increase in trading amount and volume. 

During the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016, annual fee revenue increased insignificantly from $162 for the three months ended September 30,
2015 to $440, as the premium service was not as popular as the Company expected. However, no decision is being made as to
whether the service will be terminated in the near future. 

During the three-month
period ended September 30, 2016, authorized agent subscription was $322,318 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. We
did not start earning this form of revenue until October 2015 . 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost
of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $285,252 and $214,530, respectively. Our cost of revenue
primarily includes the leasing of equipment, depreciation and amortization of hardware and software for our trading platform,
storage and insurance fee for artwork and others 

In
the third quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with Shenzhen Qianrong Culture Investment Development Co., Ltd. ( Qianrong )
to provide software development services with a total contract amount of $901,522 (HK$6,995,000). The services contracted for
are divided into different modules, according to different upgrades and new functionalities. As of September 30, 2016, nine out
of the ten modules have been completed and are operational, while as of September 30, 2015, only six out of ten modules were completed
and operational. We started to capitalize (with a total cost of $837,470 (HK$6,495,000)) and amortized these costs once the modules
were completed. All of these additional costs from gradual completion of our platform system modules and addition of equipment
contributed to an increase in our cost of revenue through 2016. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit was $5,456,957
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,491,858 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
was due to the higher transaction volume with more artworks trading on our platform. 

Listing fees contributed
51.7% of the total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 16.3% in the corresponding period in 2015,
while commission revenue contributed 29.1% for the three months ended 2016 compared to 82.7% in the corresponding period in 2015.
The increase in listing fee in the current period during the same period was due to more artworks listed, and more trading volume
and amount. Gross profit margins were 95% and 92% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. 

Operating Expenses 

Selling expense was
$652,207, or 11 % of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $116,090, or 4% of net sales, for the
comparable period in 2015, an increase of 462%. Selling expense consists primarily of marketing expenses. 

25   

General and administrative
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,744,965 compared to $882,982 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Despite the decrease in consultancy fee by $39,883, the substantial increase was primarily due to an increase in legal
and professional fees by $6,689 because of more filing and compliance activities; an increase in salaries by $596,039 because
of an increase in employee headcount; an increase in office and rental expenses by $158,788 because of the new rented office space
for Hong Kong Takung in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tianjin; an increase in travelling expenses by $67,325 because of more travelling
needed to set up Shanghai Takung and Tianjin Takung, and an increase in stock-based compensation amounting to $928 because of
expenses being paid to employees and non-employees, and an increase in other expenses by $72,097. 

The following table
sets forth the main components of the Company s operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Net Income  

We had a net income
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $2,451,737 compared to net income of $1,144,073 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. 

The increase in net
income during this current period was primarily due to an increase of revenue by $3,035,821, as discussed in previous paragraphs. 

NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
2016 COMPARED TO NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015.  

Revenue 

The following tables
set forth our consolidated statements of income data: 

26   

The following tables
set forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): 

Listing fee revenue
was $8,166,072 and $1,549,587; commission revenue was $3,739,958 and $3,267,516; gross management fee revenue was $1,341,294 and
$98,674; annual fee revenue was $869 and $1,591; authorized agent subscription revenue was $966,059 and nil for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Since the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company has received one more revenue stream
in the form of authorized agent subscriptions, with the contribution of $966,059 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, there were fifteen pieces of painting, fifty-nine pieces of precious stones, eleven pieces of jewelry,
three pieces of ivory, eighteen pieces of amber and two pieces of porcelain pastel paintings successfully listed on our system.
The total listing values were $3,349,005 (HK$26,000,000) for the painting, $5,744,832 (HK$44,600,000) for the precious stones,
$1,816,191 (HK$14,100,000) for the jewelry, $515,232 (HK$4,000,000) for the ivory, $7,239,003 (HK$56,200,000) for the ambers,
and $334,900 (HK$2,600,000) for the porcelain pastel paintings, of which 47.75%-48% (for the fifteen pieces of painting), 29%-48.5%
(for the fifty-nine pieces of precious stones), 29%-48% (for the eleven pieces of jewelry), 47% (for the three pieces of ivory),
45%-48% (for the eighteen pieces of amber), and 45%-46% (for two pieces of porcelain pastel paintings ) of the relevant listed
values were charged as listing fees. 

Compared to the corresponding
period ended September 30, 2015, only four pieces of jewelry, twelve pieces of precious stones, and three pieces of amber with
a total listing value of $1,625,177 (HK$12,600,000), $1,470,399 (HK$11,400,000) and $812,589 (HK$6,300,000) were listed, of which
31% (for the four pieces of jewelry), 47% (for the five piece of precious stones listed in the first half year) and 32% (for the
other seven pieces of precious stones listed in the third quarter of 2015),and 47% (for the three pieces of amber) of the listed
values were charged as listing fee revenue. 

The increase in number
of pieces listed, listing values and corresponding listing fees charged during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulted in an increase in listing fee revenue in the current period. 

During the nine months
period ended September 30, 2016, commission revenue increased mainly due to more artworks being listed and commencement of operations
of Shanghai Takung in July 2015 that allowed transactions to be settled in Renminbi. This increased the number of traders from
mainland China, as well as the trading volume and transaction amounts. The increase was however offset by increased rebates during
this period. 

Our trading volume
and transaction amounts increased significantly during nine months ended September 30, 2016. Trading amount and trading volume
increased by 283% and 170% respectively during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the corresponding period in
2015. Shanghai Takung contributed 54% of the total trading volume, and 37% of the total trading amount. 

27   

During the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, management fee revenue increased by $1,242,620, from $98,674 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 to $1,341,294, due to the aforementioned increase in trading amount and volume. 

During the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, annual fee revenue decreased from $1,591 to $869, as the premium service was not as popular as
the Company expected. However, no decision has been made to terminate the service in the near future. 

During the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016, authorized agent subscription was $966,059 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We did
not start earning this form of revenue until October 2015.

for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $4,325,026 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
was due to the higher transaction volume with more artworks trading on our platform. 

Listing fees contributed
57.4% of the total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 31.5% in the corresponding period in 2015,
while commission revenue contributed 26.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 66.4% in the corresponding
period in 2015. The increase mainly contributed from listing fee income was due to the significant increase in both trading amount
and trading volume. Depreciation under the cost of revenue was increased by 32% in the current period compared to the same period
in 2015. Gross profit margin was 94% and 88% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.

expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $5,076,689 compared to $1,950,662 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The substantial increase was primarily due to an increase in consultancy fees by $9,284 because of more consultants
being engaged; an increase in legal and professional fees by $222,348 because of more filing and compliance activities; an increase
in salaries by $1,438,025 because of an increase in employee headcount; an increase in office and rental expenses by $595,627

The cash balance at the beginning of the period was $10,769,456. The cash balance on September 30, 2016 was $16,831,035. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $811,630. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $507,032.
Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1,928,191 during the period. The resulting change in cash for the period was

As of September 30,
2016, the Company had $34,592,304 in total current liabilities, which comprised of $528,220 in accrued expenses and other payables,
$287,698 in advance from customers, $25,448,772 in customer deposits, $3,519,580 in short-term borrowings from third parties,

The Company had deferred tax liabilities
of $54,361 as of September 30, 2016, and $45,037 as of December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company s total liabilities
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to $34,646,665 and $18,472,318, respectively. 

In Note 4, 10 and 11, it is disclosed that the Company had
secured three loans for a total of US$ 5.8 million. The purpose of these loans is to strengthen the Company s HKD currency
reserves and ensure that all of its Hong Kong-based online traders can make HKD withdrawals on demand. The three loans and the
decision to increase the company s HKD reserves were deemed necessary as a result of the Chinese government s capital
controls associated with cross border fund transfers, which have made it difficult for companies to convert RMB into HKD and other
currencies.  

The first two loans, of US$1.5 million and US$2.0 million,
were secured from Hong Kong-based Merit Crown Limited on July 15 and August 24, 2016, respectively. Both loans carry annual interest
of eight percent and expire on December 31, 2016, with an option to renew based on negotiation. 

The third loan, of HKD18 million, or approximately US$2.3 million,
was secured from Ms. Jianping Mao, on August 25, 2016. Of the HKD18 million, HKD10 million is due three months after the effective
date, and HKD8 million is due by December 31, 2016. This loan also carries annual interest of eight percent with an option to
renew based on negotiation. 

The Company is in the process of negotiating with Merit Crown
and Ms. Wang to extend the due dates of the three loans for a further 6 months. 

The Company is not aware of any known
trends, events or uncertainties which may affect its future liquidity. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment
of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Future Financings  

Our business is sufficiently funded by
cash generated from our operating activities. In order to further expand our business operations at a higher growth rate, we may
need to obtain financing through equity sales of our common shares. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to
existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for
debt or other financing to expand our operations and other activities or if we are able, there is no guarantee that existing shareholders
will not be substantially diluted. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies
and estimates that we use to make budgetary and financial statement assumptions. A complete summary of these policies is included
in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information
from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.
Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures  

We conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule
13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), under the supervision of and with
the participation of our management, which presently comprises our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Di Xiao and our Chief Financial
Officer, Mr. Chun Hin Leslie Chow. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits
under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

                                         control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                                         registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
                                         and   

b)  Any
                                         fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
                                         a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
