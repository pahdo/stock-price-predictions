TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT   

WIGI4YOU,
INC.   

   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   September
30, 2016   

NOTE
A   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

A
summary of significant accounting policies of Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company s
financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements.
These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management who are responsible for their integrity
and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose.  

Basis
of Presentation  

The
unaudited financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) Regulation S-X rule 8-03. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same
basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary
to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the period
then ended. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim financial statements related to the
period are unaudited. The results for the three months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for any subsequent quarters or for the entire year ending June 30, 2017. The balance sheet at June 30, 2016 has
been derived from the audited financial statements at that date.  

Organization,
Nature of Business and Trade Name   

Wigi4you,
Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2014. Wigi4you, Inc. intends to provide a website and
mobile app to assist event planners in locating performers, bands and speakers, booking locations and planning events in areas
around the United States and Canada.   

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to
operationalize the Company s website and apps before another company develops similar websites or apps.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments
that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the
period.  

Depreciation
is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated
useful lives of depreciable assets are:  

For
federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements
purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.  

The
Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date. The Company currently does not have
any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

On
June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
(Topic 915).   Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage
entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US
GAAP.  In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a
development stage entity;  (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been
in the development stage.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and
interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim
reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued.  

Revenue
recognition   

The
Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC 605-35  Revenue Recognition .  Revenue
is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, all obligations have been performed pursuant
to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured.  The Company recognizes revenues on sales
of its services, based on the terms of the customer agreement.  The customer agreement takes the form of either a contract
or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price.  If
the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized at the time the service
is provided to the customer.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that
are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as
the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required
to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact
and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such
as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following
hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy
upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:  

Level
1    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2    Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices
for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level
3    Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  

In
accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at
fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.  

Advertising   

Advertising
expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.  A change in managements  estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Wigi4You, Inc. s financial
condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Wigi4You, Inc. s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation
of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.  

Capital
Stock   

The
Company has authorized Seventy Five Million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Seven Million Two
Hundred and Fifty Thousand (7,250,000) shares and Five Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand (5,250,000) shares of common stock
were issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net
income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes.  

NOTE
B   GOING CONCERN   

The
Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable
to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
However, the Company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to
continue as a going concern.  

Under
the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither
the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations.
Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described
in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

During
the next year, the Company s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its
business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the
payment of expenses associated with app development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional
capital.  

Historically,
it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and
growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company s stock or through
loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company s
failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.  

In
the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock. For the coming
year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates
enough revenues through the operations as stated above.  

NOTE
C   COMMON STOCK   

On
February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds
of $21,000.  

As
of August 23, 2016 the Company has received $50,000 from investors for 2,000,000 shares of common stock to be issued. The shares
were subscribed as per a Registration Statement filed with the SEC to register and sell 2,000,000 shares of newly issued common
stock at an offering price of $0.025 per share.  

On
September 21, 2016, Company issued 2,000,000 Common Shares to the investors at $0.025 per share for cash proceeds of $50,000 against
common stock subscribed.  

NOTE
D   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

On
July 22, 2014, a Director of the company paid $555 to Thomas Puzzo towards his accounts payable due.  

  The
loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand.  

On
February 19, 2015, Company issued 5,250,000 Common Shares to the director of the company at $0.004 per share for cash proceeds
of $21,000.  

NOTE
E   INCOME TAXES   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has incurred net losses and therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred
tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately
$21,968 at September 30, 2016, and will expire beginning in the year 2034.  

The
provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate
of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes as follows:  

Net
deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016:  

Due
to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $21,968
for federal income tax reporting purposes could be subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating
loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.  

The
Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability.  

The
Company had no accrued penalties and interest related to taxes as of September 30, 2016.  

NOTE
F   SUBSEQUENT EVENT   

The
Company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after September 30, 2016 through the date of this filing. The Company
determined that it does not have any subsequent event requiring recording or disclosure in the financial statements for the three
months ended September 30, 2016.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

Certain
statements made in this report may constitute  forward-looking statements  on our current expectations and projections

Our
business plan is to create a website and an independent mobile application that enables consumers to find the best performers,
entertainers, bands, speakers and event services easily and which are expected to be accessible for everyone in the United States
and Canada. Whether a first-time event planner or a seasoned professional, customers can book everything needed for a successful
event in one location. We plan on developing a simple booking platform which will allow for an easy connection between event planner
and talent. Users will type in the category in which they are interested, so a list of local talent can be provided. We plan on
allowing users the ability to watch videos and see reviews.  

Wigi4you
will give event planners a fast and easy way to browse, contact, and hire entertainers and services needed for any event.  

Status
of Publicly Announced New Products or Services    

Wigi4You
currently has no new publicly announced products or services.  

Competitive
Business Conditions and Strategy; Wigi4You s Position in the Industry    

Wigi4You
intends to establish itself as a competitive company in the market for event planners. Wigi4You s main competitors are firms
offering similar services.  

Outsourcing
of Software Programmers.    

Wigi4You
plans to hire independent sub-contractors (programmers and web site developers) to customize the public domain software which
is planned to be the foundation to our website and mobile application. We believe that these services may be obtained at competitive
prices from software outsourcing companies operating outside the United States; however we may encounter good programmers at competitive
rates within the United States. At this time we have no arrangements with any vendors or third parties to obtain hardware, or
programming.  

Patents,
Trademarks, Licenses, Agreements or Contracts    

There
are no aspects of our business plan which require a patent, trademark, or product license. We have not entered into any vendor
agreements or contracts that give or could give rise to any obligations or concessions.  

Governmental
Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements   

None   

Research
and Development Activities and Costs    

We
have spent no time on specialized research and development activities, and have no plans to undertake any research or development
in the future.  

Number
of Employees    

Wigi4You
has no employees. Our sole officer and director is donating his time to the   development of the
Company, and intends to do whatever work is necessary in order to bring us to the point of earning revenues. We have no other
employees, and do not foresee hiring any additional employees in the near future. We plan to engage independent contractors and
sub-contractors to design and develop our website, manage our internet marketing efforts.  

Plan
of Operation    

We
are a development stage company that only recently commenced with its business operations and we currently have no revenue and
no significant assets. Our executive offices are located at Derech MagDiel 39/11, Hold-hasharon Israel 45342. The office is a
location at which the Company receives mail, has office services and can hold meetings. Our officer, Omri Revivo, works on Company
business from his residence in Israel.  

During
the first year of operations, Wigi4you plans to develop and commercialize an independent mobile application that enables consumers
to find event talent and services, plan for their needs, and get real-time quote notifications.  

We
plan to engage in the following activities to expand our business operations:  

1)  
      Create
    an iPhone Application   This will allow event talent and services to create a profile that includes:   

a.  
      Highest
    visibility;   

b.  
      20
    category placements;   

c.  
      100
    photos including hi-resolution photos;   

d.  
      Accept
    deposits of up to $2,000;   

e.  
      Show
    contact information;   

f.  
      Have
    1gb available for audio/video;   

g.  
      Link
    to their website; and   

h.  
      Top
    priority in search results.   

The
application will allow users to pick the event talent and services for events in their area, pick their best quote and to pay
and secure the talent and services.  

2)  
      Create
    a web portal where event planners can create, edit and save the plans and which supports the iPhone application. The web portal
    will:   

a.  
      Allow
    site administrators to login and make changes;   

b.  
      Allows
    site administrators to create new plans for different service providers;   

c.  
      Allow
    site administrators to rank plans;   

d.  
      Keep
    records of all site users who have signed up and their plans and preferences; and    

e.  
      Create
    a simple algorithm that ranks the event talent and services.   

Below
is a brief description of our planned activities  

Months
1 to 3   

Our
management team will work with a third-party Web development company to gather the requirements and agree on the UX (User Experience)
options using wire-framing techniques. Once the UX design is defined, we expect it to be developed into a UI (User Interface)
design. Once the UX and UI are complete, it can be passed on to the development team. We hope the outcome of this phase will be
a complete design for the iPhone application.  

Months
4 to 6   

We
will ask the third-party Web development company to build the administrative portal. We expect the iPhone application to be built
using native objective-C Code. The Android application is expected to be built using native java code. Once the architecture has
been finalized, the development of the iPhone application and the admin web portal can occur in parallel. We plan on retaining
the services of a third-party software developer for development of the application.  

Months
7 to 12   

During
the final 6-months of our initial development phase, we plan to begin testing and deploying the website and associated applications.
We expect to achieve the following:  

Correct
    any detected or defects;   

Submit
    Wigi4you to the iPhone App Store;   

Promote
    Wigi4 to freelancers and small businesses; and   

Provide
    support for multi-users.   

The
iPhone application anticipate testing on an iPhone 5. Once we are satisfied with the performance of the application, we can release
it in the App Store, making it available for download.  

The
software developer can facilitate the App Store submission process and manage approval issues. Once submitted, Apple can review
the application to ensure the application is reliable and is free of explicit and offensive material. We expect to be completed
by the end of month 8 after defects have been fixed. Once submitted to the App Store, we expect the review process to take 3-4
weeks. However, we cannot guarantee acceptance by Apple or the timeliness of the review process.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

Revenues    

During
the three months period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we have not generated any revenue.  

Operating
Expenses     

The
Company s operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is $4,402 and for the three month ended September
30, 2015 is $3,500. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 consist of General and Administrative Expense
$1,402 and Professional Fees $3,000. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 consist of Professional
fee $3,500.  

Net
Loss   

During
the three month ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized net losses of $4,402 and $3,500 , respectively.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

On
September 30, 2016, we had total current assets of $42,557 which consist of $37,366 in Cash, and $5,191 in prepaid expense. We
had total current liabilities of $3,555, which consist of $555 due to related party and $3,000 accounts payable.  

Historically,
we have financed our cash flow and operations from the sale of common stock and loan from related party.  Net cash provided
by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $9,000, which consist of proceeds for common stock issued
$9,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 net cash provided by financing activities was $0.  

We
have not yet generated any revenue from our operations. We will require additional funds to fully implement our plans. These funds
may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership
of our shares. We currently do not have any arrangements for additional financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when
required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing, a successful marketing and promotion program and, further
in the future, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in
a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would
be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.   We will require additional funds to
maintain our reporting status with the SEC and remain in good standing with the state of Nevada.  

Going
Concern   

We
have incurred net loss since our inception on March 19, 2014 through September 30, 2016 totaling $21,968 and have completed only
the preliminary stages of our business plan.  We anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues
and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations and ultimately, to attain profitability.  Our
ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is
uncertain.  Accordingly, our independent auditors  report on our financial statements for the year ended June
30, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, including additional
information contained in the notes to our financial statements describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure.  The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

We
do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

As
required by Rule 13a-15/15d-15 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934,as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of
September 30, 2016, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Company's disclosure
controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Company's management,
our President (Principal Executive Officer) and Treasurer (Principal Accounting Officer). Based upon the results of that evaluation,
our management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
and did not provide reasonable assurance that material information related to our Company required to be disclosed in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions
on required disclosure.  

MANAGEMENT'S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management
and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that:  

Pertain
                                         to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
                                         the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;    

Provide
                                         reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
                                         of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
                                         the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being
                                         made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
                                         and    

Provide
                                         reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
                                         use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
                                         statements.    

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 . In making this assessment,
we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in INTERNAL CONTROL
-- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.  

Our
management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on
the criteria in INTERNAL CONTROL -- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK issued by the COSO.  

This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual
report.  

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above
during the first quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our
internal controls over financial reporting.
