       ORGANIZATION     

China
Modern Agricultural Information, Inc. (the  Company ), formerly known as Trade Link Wholesalers, Inc. ( Trade
Link ), was incorporated on December 22, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On April 4, 2011, the Board of Directors
of Trade Link filed an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Nevada to effect the name change from Trade
Link to China Modern Agricultural Information, Inc.  

On
January 28, 2011, Trade Link entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) by and among (i) Value
Development Holdings, Ltd. ( Value Development ), a British Virgin Islands company, ( BVI ) (ii) Value
Development s stockholders, (iii) Trade Link, and (iv) Trade Link s principal stockholders. Pursuant to the terms
of the Exchange Agreement, Value Development and the Value Development stockholders transferred to Trade Link all of the shares
of Value Development in exchange for the issuance of 35,998,000 shares of Trade Link s common stock as set forth in the
Exchange Agreement, so that the Value Development stockholders owned 87.80% of Trade Link s outstanding shares (the  Share
Exchange ).  

On
January 28, 2011, Value Development through its wholly subsidiaries, Value Development Group Limited completed the
acquisition of Harbin Jiasheng Consulting Managerial Co. Ltd. ( Jiasheng Consulting  or  WFOE ), a
holding company. Jiasheng Consulting has Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ) agreements with Mr. Liu Zhengxin, the
Company s Chief HR Officer, and Mr. Youliang Wang, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, as well as with
Heilongjiang Zhongxian Information Co., Ltd. ( Zhongxian Information ). Mr. Zhengxin holds a 62% equity interest
in Zhongxian Information and Mr.  holds a 38% equity interest in Zhongxian Information. Pursuant to the VIE agreement
signed by Mr. Zhengxin and Mr. Wang, Jiasheng Consulting now controls and performs all management responsibilities for
Zhongxian Information. The contractual arrangements are comprised of a series of agreements, including a shareholder voting
rights proxy agreement, exclusive consulting and service agreement, exclusive call option agreement and equity pledge
agreement, through which Jiasheng Consulting has the right to provide exclusive and complete business support and technical
and consulting services to Zhongxian Information for an annual fee in the amount of Zhongxian Information s yearly net
profits after tax. Additionally, Zhongxian Information s stockholders have pledged their rights, title and equity
interests in Zhongxian Information as security for the collection of consulting and service fees provided through an Equity
Pledge Agreement.

NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (IN U.S. $)    

   FOR
THE  THREE MONTHS ended SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015     

   (UNAUDITED)   

1.   
       ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)     

In
order to further reinforce Jiasheng Consulting s rights to control and operate Zhongxian Information, the stockholders of
Zhongxian Information have granted Jiasheng Consulting the exclusive right and option to acquire all of their equity interests
in Zhongxian Information through an Exclusive Option Agreement.  

The
exchange agreement transaction constituted a reverse takeover transaction. Accordingly, reverse takeover accounting was adopted
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the consolidated financial statements are issued under
the name of China Modern Agricultural Information, Inc. (the legal acquirer), but are a continuation of the consolidated financial
statements of Value Development (the accounting acquirer) and the VIE its subsidiaries. Before and after the Share Exchange, Value
Development, Value Development Group Limited (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Value Development), Jiasheng Consulting, and Zhongxian
Information and their 99% owned subsidiary, Heilongjiang Xinhua Cattle Industry Co., Ltd. ( Xinhua Cattle ) were under
common control. Therefore, the reorganization was effectively a legal recapitalization accounted for as transactions between entities
under common control at the carry over basis, in a manner similar to pooling-of-interests accounting.  

Zhongxian
Information and Xinhua Cattle are engaged in the acquisition, breeding and rearing of dairy cows, and production and sale of fresh
milk to manufacturing and distribution companies. Zhongxian Information was established in China in January 2005 with registered
capital of 10 million Renminbi ( RMB ). In February 2006, it acquired 99% of the registered capital of Xinhua Cattle,
which was established in China in December 2005 with registered capital of three million RMB. Xinhua Cattle had no significant
activities and its cost approximated the fair value at the date of acquisition.  

On
November 23, 2011, Zhongxian Information acquired 100% of the equity interest of Shangzhi Yulong Co., Ltd. ( Yulong )
from Yulong s original stockholders for consideration of 9,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock and cash consideration
of $4,396,000.  

Yulong
was a privately held company in China engaged in the acquisition, breeding and rearing of dairy cows, and production and sale
of fresh milk to manufacturing and distribution companies.

       ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)     

On
July 16, 2015, the Company, transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Value Development Holdings, Ltd. ( Value
Development ) to China Dairy Corporation Ltd. ( China Dairy,  a Hong Kong company), which is 60% owned indirectly
by the Company through the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hope Diary Holdings Ltd. ( Hope Diary,  a British
Virgin Islands company). China Dairy was newly incorporated in January 2015 and did not have any significant assets or liabilities,
or business operations, which was 100% owned by Company s PRC corporate advisor, who formed China Dairy on behalf of the
Company. Further, the sole shareholder transferred 60% of the total outstanding shares of China Dairy to Hope Diary and 40% to
various shareholders and consultants of the Company (as described below) for nominal consideration.  

These
transactions involve no consideration received or paid as Value Development and China Dairy are under common control by the Company
and this transaction is a restriction to the Company s interests in Value Development.

1.   
       ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)     

The
40% of the 10,000 shares of China Dairy were transferred from the sole shareholder of China Dairy to the following entities for
nominal consideration, which has     direct or indirect relationship with the shareholder
and consultants of the Company: 3% to Beijing Ruihua Future, 4% to Donghe Group, 3% to Integral Capital, 20% to Dingxi Shanghai
Fund and 10% to Zhiyuan International. Immediately after the transfer, 65,000 bonus shares were issued at no consideration for
every existing share held by the following entities.  

Value
Development is the sole owner of Value Development Group Limited, which is the sole owner of Harbin Jiasheng Consulting Managerial
Co. Ltd., which is the Company s subsidiary in China, with respect to which the operating company, Heilongjiang Zhongxian
Information Co. Ltd., is a variable interest entity. The effect of this transaction was to reduce the interest of the Company
in its operating company by 40%.     The Company uses the China Dairy s offering
price for IPO to approximate the fair value of the 40% stock granted to the shareholder and consultants. The Company recognized
a stock compensation to the shareholder and consultants of approximately $32,098,000 and $5,664,000, respectively, during the
three months ended September 30, 2015 in general and administrative expense.  

On
September 16, 2015 the Company s 60%-owned subsidiary, Harbin Jiasheng Consulting Management Co., Ltd. ( Jiasheng Consulting ),
exercised its option to purchase all of the registered equity of the Company s operating subsidiary, Heilongjiang Zhongxian
Information Co., Ltd. ( Zhongxian Information ) from its stockholders Zhengxin Liu and Youliang Wang, who are also the
members of the Company s Board of Directors, for RMB10,000 (approximately $1,554).

1.   
       ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)     

Prior
to the acquisition, Jiasheng Consulting controlled Zhongxian Information through a series of contractual agreements, which made
Zhongxian Information a variable interest entity, the effect of which was to cause the balance sheet and operating results of
Zhongxian Information to be consolidated with those of Jiasheng Consulting in the Company s financial statements. As a result
of the acquisition by Jiasheng Consulting of the registered ownership of Zhongxian Information, the balance sheet and operating
results of Zhongxian Information will hereafter continue to be consolidated with those of Jiasheng Consulting as its 100% owned
subsidiary.    

As
a result of the entry into the foregoing agreements, the Company has a corporate structure as set forth below:  

On
April 8, 2016, the Company s 60% owned subsidiary, China Dairy Corporation Limited issued 84,906,541 CDI shares at AUD $0.2
per share on ASX and raised total fund of AUD $16,981,308 (USD $13,021,267). After the IPO, the Company s ownership was
diluted to 53.07%.

Basis
of Accounting and Presentation (continued)   

Variable
Interest Entity   

Pursuant
to Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810,   Consolidation 
 ( ASC 810 ), the Company is required to include in its consolidated financial statements the financial statements
of its VIE s. ASC 810 requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk
of loss for the VIE or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE s residual returns. VIEs are those entities in which
a company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risk of, and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the
entity, and therefore the company is the primary beneficiary of the entity.  

Zhongxian
Information and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Chinese VIE ) have no assets that are collateral for or restricted
solely to settle their obligations. The creditors of the Chinese VIE and its subsidiaries do not have recourse to the Company s
general credit. Because Value Development, Value Development Group Limited and Jiasheng Consulting are established for the sole
purpose of holding ownership interest and do not have any operations, the financial statement amounts and balances are principally
those of the Chinese VIE and its subsidiaries.  

Under
ASC 810, an enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the enterprise has both
of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE s
economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant
to the VIE. The Company s determination of whether it has this power is not affected by the existence of kick-out rights
or participating rights, unless a single enterprise, including its related parties and de facto agents, has the unilateral ability
to exercise those rights. The Chinese VIE s actual stockholders do not hold any kick-out rights that will affect the consolidation
determination.  

On
September 16, 2015 the VIE structure was terminated when Jiasheng Consulting exercised its option to purchase all of the registered
equity of Zhongxian Information. Jiasheng Consulting became the sole owner of Zhongxian Information.

Foreign
Currency Translations   

All
Company assets are located in the People s Republic of China ( PRC ). The functional currency for the majority
of the Company s operations is the Renminbi ( RMB ). The Company uses the United States dollar ( US Dollar 
or  US$  or  $ ) for financial reporting purposes. The consolidated financial statements of the Company
have been translated into US dollars in accordance with FASB ASC 830,   Foreign Currency Matters.   All asset
and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Equity accounts have
been translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred. Statements of income and other comprehensive
income amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the periods presented. Adjustments resulting from the
translation of the Company s consolidated financial statements are recorded as other comprehensive income ( OCI ).  

The
exchange rates used to translate amounts in RMB and Australian dollars (the  AUS Dollar , AUD$  or  A$ )
into US dollars for preparing the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    

Foreign
Currency Translations (continued)   

Foreign
currency translation adjustments of $(248,988) and $(5,040,228), respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, have been reported as other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive
income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) of the Company consists entirely of foreign currency translation adjustments.
Pursuant to ASC 740-30-25-17,   Exceptions to Comprehensive Recognition of Deferred Income Taxes,   the Company
does not recognize deferred U.S. taxes related to the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, recognizes
no income tax expense or benefit from foreign currency translation adjustments.  

Although
government regulations now allow convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain.
Hence, such translations should not be construed as representations that the RMB could be converted into US dollars at that rate
or any other rate.  

The
value of the RMB against the US dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China s
political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the RMB could materially affect the Company s consolidated
financial condition in terms of US dollar reporting.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company s primary sources of revenues are derived from (a) sale of fresh milk to Chinese manufacturing and distribution
companies of dairy products and (b) commissions from local farmers on their monthly milk sales. The Company s revenue recognition
policies comply with FASB ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition.   Revenues from the sale of goods are recognized when
the goods are delivered and the title is transferred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer,
the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.

       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)    

Revenue
Recognition (continued)   

Milk
sales revenue is recognized when the title has been passed to the customers, which is the date when the milk is delivered to designated
locations and accepted by the customers and the previously discussed requirements are met. Fresh milk is delivered to its customers
on a daily basis. The customers  acceptance occurs upon inspection of the quality and measurement of quantity at the time
of delivery. The Company does not provide the customer with the right of return. Sales commission revenue is recognized on a monthly
basis based on monthly sales reports received.   

Vulnerability
Due to Operations in PRC    

The
Company s operations may be adversely affected by significant political, economic and social uncertainties in the PRC. Although
the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for more than twenty years, no assurance can be given that the PRC
government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event
of a change in leadership, social or political disruption or unforeseen circumstances affecting the PRC s political, economic
and social conditions. There is also no guarantee that the PRC government s pursuit of economic reforms will be consistent
or effective.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (CONTINUED)     

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

FASB
ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurement   specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs
to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based on market data obtained from independent
sources (observable inputs). In accordance with ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy:  

Level
    1 Inputs    
      Unadjusted quoted
    market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access.   

Level 2 Inputs    
      Inputs other than
    the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.   

Level 3 Inputs    
      Inputs based on
    valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurements.   

ASC
820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure
fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Valuation techniques used need to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  

The
Company did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented at fair value on a recurring basis. Carrying
values of non-derivative financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, interest receivable, notes receivable, prepayments,
accrued expenses, and other payables, and stockholder loans, approximated their fair values due to the short maturity of these
financial instruments. The carrying value of notes receivable is valued at their net realizable value which approximates the fair
value. There were no changes in methods or assumptions during the periods presented.

Advertising
Costs   

Advertising
costs are charged to operations when incurred. Advertising costs are $120,788 and $0, respectively, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all demand and time deposits and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.   

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable is stated at cost, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts if required. Receivables outstanding longer than the payment
terms are considered past due. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses when necessary resulting
from the failure of customers to make required payments. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes
allowances where there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances.   

In
evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the
balance, the customer s payment history, its current credit-worthiness and current economic trends. The Company has 30 days 
credit term for its milk sales and usually receives the payment in the following month. The Company considers all accounts receivable
at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, to be fully collectible and, therefore, did not provide an allowance for doubtful accounts.
For the periods presented, the Company did not write off any accounts receivable as bad debts.  

Inventories   

Inventories,
comprised principally of livestock feed, are valued at the lower of cost or market value. The value of inventories is determined
using the weighted average cost method.  

The
Company estimates an inventory allowance for excessive or unusable inventories. Inventory amounts are reported net of such allowances
if any. There was no allowance for excessive or unusable inventories as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.

Prepaid
Expenses   

Prepaid
expenses as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 mainly represent the prepayments of approximately $1,278,600 and $1,217,900,
respectively for prepaid cow insurance expense. Prepayment as of September 30, 2016 represents the payment for purchase of machineries.  

Prepaid
Land Leases   

Prepaid
land leases represent the prepayment for grassland rental (see Note 7).  

Property,
Plant and Equipment   

Property,
plant and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the price paid to acquire or construct
the asset, including capitalized interest during the construction period, and any expenditures that substantially increase the
assets value or extends the useful life of an existing asset. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Major repairs and betterments that significantly extend original useful lives or improve
productivity are capitalized and depreciated over the periods benefited. Maintenance and repairs are generally expensed as incurred.  

The
estimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment categories are as follows:  

Machinery
    and equipment       
      3
    to 10 years

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets   

The
Company utilizes FASB ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment   ( ASC 360 ), which addresses the
financial accounting and reporting for the recognition and measurement of impairment losses for long-lived assets. In accordance
with ASC 360, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company may recognize an impairment of a long-lived asset in the event the net
book value of such asset exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset. No impairment of long-lived
assets was recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Biological
Assets   

Biological
assets consist of dairy cows for milking purposes and breeding.   

Immature
Biological Assets    

Immature
biological assets are recorded at cost, including acquisition costs, transportation costs, insurance expenses, and feeding costs,
incurred in raising the cows. Once the cow is able to produce milk, the cost of the immature biological asset is transferred to
mature biological assets using the weighted average cost method.  

Mature
Biological Assets    

Mature
biological assets are recorded at their original purchase price or the weighted average immature biological asset transfer cost.
Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of eight years using the straight-line method. The estimated residual
value is 10%. Feeding and management costs incurred on mature biological assets are included as cost of goods sold. When biological
assets, including male cows, are retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, the cost and accumulated depreciation
will be removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss will be included in the results of operations for the respective
period.

Biological
Assets (continued)   

The
Company reviews the carrying value of its biological assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events and circumstances
indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual
disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss will
be recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The factors considered by management
in performing this assessment include current health status and production capacity. There were no impairment losses recorded
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740,   Income Taxes   ( ASC 740 ),
which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial
statement and income tax purposes. The differences relate principally to the undistributed earnings of the Company s subsidiary
under PRC law. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of those differences, which will either
be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating
losses that are available to offset future taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, undistributed earnings allocated to
Zhongxian Information were approximately $195,800,000 and $192,800,000, respectively.

Taxes (Continued)   

ASC
740 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in
the financial statements. Under ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is
more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position would be measured based on
the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance
on de-recognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities,
and accounting for interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
the Company does not have a liability for any uncertain tax positions.  

The
income tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate are summarized as follows:  

United
States    

The
Company is subject to United States tax at graduated rates from 15% to 35%. No provision for income tax in the United States has
been made as the Company had no U.S. taxable income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

BVI    

Value
Development and Hope Diary are incorporated in the BVI and is governed by the income tax laws of the BVI. According to current
BVI income tax law, the applicable income tax rate for the Company is 0%.

Xinhua
Cattle and Yulong are entitled to a tax exemption for the full Enterprise Income Tax in China due to a government tax preferential
policy for the dairy farming industry. In January 2015, Zhongxian obtained an income tax exemption notice from the tax authority
to exempt the income tax on its investment income from its subsidiaries Xinhua Cattle and Yulong.   

Net
Income (Loss) Per Share   

The
Company computes net income (loss) per common share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,   Earnings Per Share   ( ASC
260 ). Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the amount available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income
per common share is computed by dividing the amount available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding plus the effect of any dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Accordingly, the number of weighted
average shares outstanding as well as the amount of net income per share are presented for basic and diluted per share calculations
for all periods reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income. There were no
dilutive shares outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Statutory

transfer 10% of their net income, as determined under PRC accounting rules and regulations, to a statutory reserve fund until
such reserve balance reaches 50% of its registered capital. The statutory reserve fund is non-distributable other than during
liquidation and can be used to fund previous years  losses, if any, and may be utilized for business expansion or used to
increase registered capital, provided that the remaining reserve balance after such use is not less than 25% of the registered
capital. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the required statutory reserve funds have been fully funded.

       Recently Issued
    Accounting Standards     

In
August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the
statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of contingent consideration arising from
a business combination, insurance settlement proceeds, and distributions from certain equity method investees. The new standard
is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption
is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on credit losses on financial instruments which replaces the
incurred-loss impairment methodology. The new guidance requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur
for most financial assets and certain other instruments. The standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020;
however early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating whether this standard
will have a material impact on its financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).'' This guidance supersedes current
guidance on revenue recognition in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.'' In addition, there are disclosure requirements related
to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.2015-14 to
defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. For public business entities that follow U.S. GAAP,
the deferral results in the new revenue standard are being effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU )
model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer
than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense
recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which
includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The update to the standard
is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on
the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In
September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-16: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period
Adjustments ( ASU 2015-16 ), which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement
period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact
on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. ASU 2015-16 is effective for interim
and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. This accounting standard update is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendment is effective for all
entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Earlier application
is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within
that reporting period. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

or cash dividends without the consent of a third party. The condensed parent company only financial statements have been prepared

On
July 16, 2015, we transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Value Development to China Dairy Corporation Ltd.,
a Hong Kong company ( China Dairy ), which is 60% owned indirectly by the Company through the Company s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Hope Diary Holdings Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company ( Hope Diary ). These transactions involve
no consideration received or paid as Value Development and China Dairy are under common control with us and this transaction is
a restriction to our interests in Value Development.  

China
Dairy was newly incorporated in January 2015 and did not have any significant assets or liabilities, or business operations, which
is 100% owned by Company s PRC corporate advisor. Further, the sole shareholder transferred the 10,000 shares of China Dairy
to Value Development 60% and various shareholder and consultants of the Company 40% at HK$1.00 per share.  

The
40% of the 10,000 shares of China Dairy were transferred from the sole shareholder of China Dairy to the following entities at
HK$1.00 per share, which has direct or indirect relationship with the shareholder and consultants of the Company: 3% to Beijing
Ruihua Future, 4% to Donghe Group, 3% to Integral Capital, 20% to Dingxi Shanghai Fund and 10% to Zhiyuan International. Immediately
after the transfer, 65,000 bonus shares were issued at no consideration for every existing share.  

Value
Development is the sole shareholder of Value Development Group Limited, which is the sole shareholder of Harbin Jiasheng Consulting
Managerial Co. Ltd. ( Jiasheng Consulting ), which is our subsidiary in China, with respect to which the operating
company, Zhongxian Information, is a variable interest entity. The effect of this transaction was to reduce the interest of ours
in its operating company by 40%. We use the China Dairy s offering price for the Proposed Offering to approximate the fair
value of the 40% stock granted to the shareholder and consultants.  

On
September 16, 2015 our 60%-owned subsidiary, Jiasheng Consulting, exercised its option to purchase all of the registered equity
of our operating subsidiary, Zhongxian Information from its stockholders Zhengxin Liu and Youliang Wang, who are also the members
of our Board of Directors, for RMB10,000 (approximately $1,634). Prior to the acquisition, Jiasheng Consulting controlled Zhongxian
Information through a series of contractual agreements, which made Zhongxian Information a variable interest entity, the effect
of which was to cause the balance sheet and operating results of Zhongxian Information to be consolidated with those of Jiasheng
Consulting in our financial statements. As a result of the acquisition by Jiasheng Consulting of the registered ownership of Zhongxian
Information, the balance sheet and operating results of Zhongxian Information hereafter continues to be consolidated with those
of Jiasheng Consulting as its 100% owned subsidiary. On April 8, 2016, our 60% owned subsidiary, China Dairy Corporation Limited
issued 84,906,541 CDI shares at AUD $0.2 per share on ASX and raised total fund of AUD $16,981,308 (USD $13,021,267). After the
IPO, our ownership was diluted to 53.07%.   

43    

Our
current structure is set forth below:  

Factors
Affecting Our Results of Operations   

Our
operating results are primarily affected by the following present factors:   

Dairy
                                         Industry Growth. We believe the market for dairy products in China for the long term
                                         will grow rapidly, driven by China s economic growth, improved living quality and
                                         increased penetration of infant formula. Accordingly, we believe that the demand of fresh
                                         milk will increase rapidly.    

Production
                                         Capacity. Our revenue largely depends on our production capacity. The production capacity
                                         in this industry is determined by the variety, aging and number of adult cows. Accordingly,
                                         we acquired Yulong Cattle in November 2011 which increased our number of cows by 3,800
                                         and improved our production capacity by approximately 90 tons per day when acquired.

Raw
                                         Material Supplies and Prices. The per unit cost of fresh milk is affected by price
                                         volatility of our raw materials and feeding expenses in the China markets.  In
                                         response to the increased cost, we leased 16,666,750 square meters of grassland in October
                                         2011, 427,572 square meters grassland in February 2013, and 521,336 square meters of
                                         grassland in May 2015. We believe that the hay production of this grassland can satisfy
                                         our raw material demand and lower our feeding cost.    

Change
                                         of operation method. We disposed a large number of adult cows to local farmers, introduced
                                         distribution channel to them and receive up to 30% of the farmers  milk sales as
                                         a commission. It makes our performance is stably increased and we have enough production
                                         resources to feed more cows by ourselves. In addition, we signed with another 27 local
                                         farmers to feed 2,000 adult cows in May 2016 to increase our production resources.    

Sale
of Cows   

In
September 2011, August 2011, and June 2011, Xinhua Cattle sold 3,787, 5,635, and 2,000 of its cows to local farmers, respectively.
In November and December 2014, Yulong sold 3,714 and 2,995 cows to local farmers respectively. 3,500 of the cows sold in 2014
were purchased from outside unrelated parties for $4,550,000. The remaining cows sold were raised by Yulong. According to the
agreements signed with the local farmers in June 2011, the sales price will be collected over five years, with a minimum payment
of 20% of the sales price to be paid each year. The related receivable is recorded at its present value at a discount rate of
12%, which is commensurate with interest rates for notes with similar risk. The Company also entered into agreements with these
local farmers for a 30% commission of their monthly milk sales generated by the cows sold in exchange for the Company s
assistance in arranging for the sale of the milk.   

44    

Pursuant
to the agreements signed in August 2011, September 2011, November 2014, and December 2014, the sales price will be collected in
monthly installments plus interest at 7% on the outstanding balance, over the remaining useful lives of the cows, which range
from one to eight years. Local farmers are required to pay 30% of monthly milk sales generated from the cows purchased by the
farmers. The 30% monthly payments are to be applied first to the monthly installment of principal for the cows sold and the balance
as commission income for the Company s assistance in arranging for the sale of the milk. The 30% monthly payments will continue
over the entire remaining life of the cows sold. While the 30% rate and the amount applied to monthly installments for the purchase
price of the cows remain the same, the amount of sales commission income will vary depending on total monthly milk sales and the
progress of repayments towards the purchase price.   

In
August 2015, Xinhua Cattle sold 200 cows to an outside party at a total price of RMB 160,000(US $24,861) including insurance of
RMB 100,000 (US $ 15,540). The cows had a net book value approximately $43,000 as of the disposal date, which includes cost basis
approximate $560,000 and accumulated depreciation approximately $516,000. In May 2016, Xinhua Cattle sold 904 cows to an outside
party at a total price of RMB 3,616,000(US $561,854). The cows had a net book value approximately $564,000 as of the disposal
date, which includes cost basis approximate $1,147,000 and accumulated depreciation approximately $583,000. In June 2016, Xinhua
Cattle also sold 500 female calves to an outside party at a total price of RMB 2,000,000 (US $310,760). The cost of these female
calves was approximate $322,000.   

In
November 2015, Yulong Cattle Sold 347 cows to an outside party at a total price of RMB 1,144,800 (US $177,879) including insurance
of RMB 104,100 (US $ 16,175). The cows had a net book value approximately $254,000 as of the disposal date, which includes cost
basis approximate $588,000 and accumulated depreciation approximately $335,000. In May 2016, Yulong Cattle sold 331 cows to an
outside party at a total price of RMB 1,390,200 (US $216,009). The cows had a net book value approximately $324,000 as of the
disposal date, which includes cost basis approximate $709,000 and accumulated depreciation approximately $385,000.   

Increase
in payment to local farmers    

Due to the significant
increase in forage price, our payment to local farmers was increased as well during last twelve months. Before March 2015, the
payment which included feeding expense and forage cost was $51, $65, $75 and $115, respectively, which paid for calve, pre-adult
cow, young cow and adult cow per month. Since April 2015, such expenses increased to $59, $76, $87 and $137, respectively, paid
for each type of cows. Since September 2015, such expenses increased to $68, $87, $101and $158, respectively. In the end of September
2015, we terminated the agreements with the original 200 local farmers and signed with new 179 local farmers near around Harbin
city. However, it didn t stop the increase in forage price. Since November 2015, the feeding expenses and forage costs increased
to $78, $96, $117 and $264 for each calve, pre-adult cow, young cow and adult cow, respectively.

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

The
following table sets forth certain information regarding our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015.   

Revenues    

Our revenue was primarily
generated from sales of fresh milk and commissions on fresh milk sales by farmers to whom we sold cows. We had total revenues
of $30,016,410 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $8,869,547 or 42%, compared to $21,146,863 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. There are two main reasons caused such increase: 1) total average milk cows increased from
13,414 to 20,609 and 2) milk s sale price increased from $0.54 per kg to $0.57 per kg since November 2015 for approximately
98% of total milk sales.   

The
following table shows a breakdown of revenue from natural milk sales and sales commission, respectively:   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our revenue generated from natural milk sales was $26,193,405 which represented an
increase of $10,239,398 or 64% compared to $15,954,007 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the natural
milk sales was primarily due to the increased number of milk cows compared to the same period of prior year.   

The
following table sets forth information regarding the number of milk cows and the revenue per cow:  

The revenue per
milk cow increased to $1,271 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,189 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $82 or 7%. There are three main reasons that caused the increase in natural
milk sales, of which two were described above: 1) total average milk cows were increased from 13,414 to 20,609 which
represented an increase by 54%; 2) milk s sales price increased from $0.54 per kg to $0.57 per kg since November 2015
for approximate 98% of total milk sales which represented an increase by 5%. In addition, due to the purchase of new adult
cows during the year ended June 30, 2016, the average age of the adult milk cows decreased, which contributed to the slight
increase in daily production. 

46    

The sales commissions
from local farmers decreased by $1,369,851 or 26% to $3,823,005 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $5,192,856
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average quantity of milk cows we now earn commission on decreased by 20% or
3,374, to 13,677 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 17,051 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to
a deduction of 3,438 cows which had been fully depreciated on September 30, 2016 from 16 farmers. Furthermore, the average age
of the milk cows we earn commission on also increased, which caused the deduction of daily production. 

Gross
profit    

Our cost of goods
sold consists of feeding food, feeding expenses and other direct production overhead which includes labor costs, depreciation,
lease, water   electricity, etc. Because we started to use the two new farms in Shuangcheng district and Xiangfang District
in Harbin, more direct production overhead was allocated to our costs of goods sold. In addition, the direct feeding expenses
and food costs paid to local farmers increased from $137 per cow before September 2015 to $264 per cow since September 2015. Furthermore,
the food costs for the cows we fed by ourselves also increased. As a result, we saw a decrease in our margins compared with the
same period in 2015.  

The
cost per milk cow increased to $927 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 which represented an increase of $274 or 42%
compared to $653 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We described the reason for the increase as above.  

Gross
profit margin    

Our gross profit margin
was 36.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 which decreased by 35.7% from the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The main reason for such a decrease was the increase in feeding and food cost and direct production overhead. 

Operating
expenses     

Our operating expenses
sharply decreased to $1,519,095 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $38,677,438 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, a decrease of $37,158,343 or 96%. Our operating expenses primarily consist of human resource costs, depreciation, professional
fees associated with filings required by the securities laws of the United States, consulting fees for a Chinese financial advisory
company and business taxes, etc. We incurred a total of $27,526 and $290,800 in VAT surcharges and business taxes for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We classified these VAT surcharges and business taxes as selling expenses.
As we discussed above, we restructured in July, 2015 and have been listed on the ASX main board. We lost 40% of the interest
of our operating company as a result. We treated the reduction of our interest by 40% as a stock compensation to our shareholders
and consultants for a total of $37,762,400 as it was recorded under our G A expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2015. This is the main reason that caused such sharp decrease in our operating expenses. 

47    

Operating
income (loss)   

As
a result of the foregoing, we had operating income of $9,383,663 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing an
increase of $35,674,622, as compared to operating loss of $26,290,959 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Non-operating
income (expenses)   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, non-operating income consists primarily of interest income of $123,663 earned on the
outstanding notes receivable from the farmers and other non-operating income of $35,628 which mainly consists of bank interest
earned. Non-operating expenses consist of the loss on the disposal of immature biological assets of $21,425. For the three months
ended September 30, 2015,  non-operating income consists primarily of interest income of
$199,914 earned on the outstanding notes receivable from the farmers and other non-operating income of $55,508 which mainly consists
of bank interest earned. Non-operating expenses consist of the loss on the disposal of mature biological assets of $34,818.   

Net
Income    

Xinhua Cattle and
Yulong Cattle are entitled to a tax exemption for the full Enterprise Income Tax in China due to a government tax preference policy
for the dairy farming industry. Zhongxian Information is subject to an Enterprise Income Tax of 25% and files its own tax returns
before January 16, 2015. On January 16, 2015, Zhongxian Information received a tax exemption notice from Harbin National Tax Bureau
on its investment income from its subsidiaries. Jiasheng Consulting (the  WFOE ) is subject to an Enterprise Income
Tax at 25% and files its own tax return before September 16, 2015. On September 16, 2015, Jiasheng Consulting purchased all of
the registered equity of Zhongxian Information and the VIE structure was terminated. Under China tax law, Jiasheng Consulting
is exempt from income tax on its investment income since September 16, 2015. The provision for income taxes was $0 and $2,464,645
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily representing the enterprise income tax on the
income of Zhongxian Information. We had a net income before non-controlling interests of $9,521,529 and net loss of $28,535,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which represented an increase in $38,056,529 or 133%. We
initially owned 99% of Xinhua Cattle s shares and our non-controlling interest was only 1% of Xinhua s net income.
On July 16, 2015, as we transferred 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Value Development to China Dairy, which we own
60% through our wholly owned subsidiary, Hope Diary. This transaction resulted a reduction of our interest in our operating company
by 40%. In addition, on April 8, 2016, our 60% owned subsidiary, China Dairy Corporation Limited issued 84,906,541 CDI shares
at AUD $0.2 per share on ASX and after the IPO, our ownership was diluted to 53.07%. As a result, net income attributed to the
non-controlling shareholders increased from 1% to 46.93%. $4,524,105 and $3,200,838 was attributed to non-controlling interest
for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We had net income attributable to the common stockholders of
the Company of $4,997,424, representing $0.09 per share and net loss of $31,735,838 representing $0.60 per share for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Foreign
Currency Translation Adjustment    

Our reporting currency
is the U.S. dollar. Our local currency, Renminbi, is our functional currency. All asset and liability accounts have been translated
using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Equity accounts have been translated at their historical exchange
rates when the capital transactions occurred. Statements of income and other comprehensive income and cash flows have been
translated using the average exchange rate for the periods presented. Adjustments resulting from the translation of our consolidated
financial statements are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange
rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of
operations as incurred. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred foreign currency translation adjustments
loss of $248,988 and $5,040,228, respectively. They are reported as other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements
of income and other comprehensive income (loss), respectively.  

48    

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

As of September 30,
2016 and June 30, 2016, we had no bank debt but amounts owed to shareholders of $1,747,120 and $1,672,707, respectively. The amounts
due to our stockholders were principally for the professional fees incurred for being a reporting company in the United States
and in Australia because of the restriction of official bank transfers abroad. At the same time, we had $34,772,233 and $30,780,198
in cash at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 as well as working capital of $63,334,688 and $56,811,959, respectively. 

Operating
activities    

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our operating activities provided $11,787,876 in net cash, compared to $10,412,312
during the three months ended September 30, 2015.The net cash provided in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was slightly
higher than our net income primarily due to the depreciation on fixed assets and biological properties of $1,658,912 and amortization
on lease of $431,746. The net cash provided in the three months ended September 30, 2015 was significantly higher than our net
income (loss) primarily due to the increase in deferred income tax liabilities of $2,464,645, depreciation on fixed assets and
biological properties of $898,640 and amortization on lease of $458,597 and the stock compensation for shareholders and consultants
of $37,762,400. However, the increase in accounts receivable of $1,736,783 caused the decrease in cash.   

Investing
activities   

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, our investing activities provided a cash outflow of $6,580,854 compared with a cash outflow of $22,375,884
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The food costs and feeding expenses for biological properties used cash of $5,237,180
and $3,529,279 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we spent $0 and $5,822,415, respectively, for purchasing milk cows. Conversely, we received cash of $628,026 and
$685,022 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from the collection of notes receivable from
the disposal of biological properties in 2011 and 2014. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we also received
$804,900 and $13,412 in cash from our disposal of biological properties, respectively. For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we spent $2,776,600 and $13,722,354, respectively, for the addition of PP E for daily operations. The
material additions during the three months ended September 30, 2015 were the production facilities, office buildings, cow-houses,
and forage storage built and refurbished on the new land, which mostly were completed and in service before June 30, 2016. 

Financing
activities    

Our
financing activities mainly included proceeds from shareholders dividends payment for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
For the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we received $28,261 and $7,909 from shareholders, respectively. For the three
months ended September 30, 2016, we paid total dividends of $1,531,762 to our subsidiary s shareholders.  

We
have historically financed our operations through cash generated from our fresh milk sales and commissions from milk sales from
local farmers. Over the long term, it is our expectation to utilize our additional capital resources to expand our operating activities. At
the present time, however, we are able to operate profitably without any significant additional investment. Moreover, our
observation of the equity markets indicates that we would be unlikely to obtain financing, or if available, on favorable terms
at this time. Accordingly, our near-term plan is to finance our operations with our current working capital and with the expected
income from our ongoing operations.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates    

Basis
of Accounting and Presentation    

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 for the quarters ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
the rules and regulations of the SEC.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company s primary sources of revenues are derived from (a) sale of fresh milk to Chinese manufacturing and distribution
companies of dairy products and (b) commissions from local farmers on their monthly milk sales.  The Company s
revenue recognition policies comply with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) 104. Revenues from the sale of
milk are recognized when the milk is delivered and the title is transferred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred
to the customer, the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.   

Milk
sales revenue is recognized when the title to the goods has been passed to our customers, which is the date when the goods are
delivered to designated locations and accepted by the customers and the previously discussed requirements are met.  Fresh
milk is delivered to our customers on a daily basis.  The customers  acceptance occurs upon inspection of quality
and measurement of quantity at the time of delivery. The Company does not provide the customer with the right of return.  Sales
commission revenue is recognized on a monthly basis based on monthly sales reports received from the dairy companies.  

Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.    

50    

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

Smaller
reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the principal executive and financial officers as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management conducted an assessment as of September 30, 2016 of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective to ensure that information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms due to a material weakness related to the lack
of accounting personnel with sufficient experience in maintaining books and records and preparing financial statements in accordance
with U.S. GAAP.  

Our ma nagement
has identified the following steps to address the above material weakness:  

(1)
We have been working with a financial accountant to assist us in preparing our financial statements in accordance with US GAAP
standards and SEC rules and regulations.  

(2)
We intend to hire, as needed, key accounting personnel with technical accounting expertise and reorganize the finance department
to ensure that accounting personnel with adequate experience, skills and knowledge relating to complex, non-routin e transactions
are directly involved in the review and accounting evaluation of our complex, non-routine transactions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

No
changes were made to our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

II - OTHER INFORMATION

self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries,
