   (Expressed

NOTE
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company without an audit.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the
financial positions, results of operations, and cash flows at October 31, 2016 and 2015, have been made.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in
the Company s April 30, 2016 and 2015 audited financial statements. The results of operations for the period ended October
31, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.  

NOTE
2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

The
management has evaluated all recent pronouncements issued by the FASB or other authoritative standards groups with their effective
dates. The management believes that these are either not applicable or are not expected to be significant to the condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Company.  

NOTE
3. GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. As at October 31, 2016 the Company has a working capital deficit of $1,319,224 and accumulated deficit of
$3,435,046.  

Prior
to July 7, 2016 the Company has relied on advances from its former CEO, director, Mercuriali Ltd and a related party to meet the
working capital requirements. On June 19, 2015, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $43,000 to Vis
Vires Group Inc. On December 28, 2015, Vis Vires Group Inc. issued a notice of conversion and elected to convert $12,000 of the
principal amount at an applicable conversion price of $0.0017 per share of common stock. Resultantly, the Company issued 7,058,824
shares of common stock. The principal amount and interest in total of $33,500 was paid on March 23, 2016. On September 29, 2015,
as amended January 22, 2016, Mercuriali Ltd agreed to advance the Company an additional $90,000. Effective March 21, 2016, the
Company entered into a Loan Agreement (Amendment 5) with Mercuriali Ltd. and Samuel Asculai providing for an increase in the loan
amounts by Mercuriali Ltd. and Samuel Asculai in the event no additional third party monies are received by the Company from US$90,000
to US$150,000.  

On
July 7, 2016, the Company and Integumen Limited (formerly Biosurface Limited) ( Integumen ) entered into a non-binding
term sheet in respect of a strategic collaboration and an option agreement (the  Option Agreement ). The Company also
issued to Integumen a secured promissory note in the amount of $100,000 (the  Note ). Under the Note, Integumen agreed
to loan the Company US$100,000 conditional upon the Company entering into the Option Agreement and entering into good faith negotiations
with a view to entering into a strategic collaboration via an asset purchase agreement (the  APA ). As explained in
Note 5, the full balance would have become due on the earlier of (i) the demand made by the Noteholder or on the 6 month anniversary
date (ii) the completion of the Asset Purchase Agreement or (iii) when, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event
of default. . On October 1, 2016, the Company and Integumen entered into the APA. Under the APA the Company agreed to sell substantially
all of its assets to Integumen. The total consideration payable to the Company is a sum equal to  3,030,000, subject to
adjustment depending on the level of Enhance  s current liabilities as at Completion. In addition, Integumen also assumed
the costs of Enhance from the date of signature of the APA until Completion and certain post completion costs.

NOTE
3. GOING CONCERN (continued)   

The
Company received $25,000 on October 14, 2016 and $30,000 on November 16, 2016 from Integumen in respect of its obligations to
meet the Interim Costs for October and November.  

On
October 31, 2016 the Company filed a Definitive Information Statement on Form 14C, a copy of which was subsequently mailed to
shareholders on November 7, 2016. The Transaction Completed on December 2, 2016 and the Company received 2,632,868 ordinary shares
in Integumen at a price of  1 per share. This comprised the total Consideration of  3,030,000 ($3,939,000) less assumed
liabilities of   320,209 ($416,272) and the prepayment of the Note in the amount of  76,923 ($100,000).  

The
APA provides that 80 per cent of the Consideration Shares should be issued on completion of the APA and the remaining 20 per cent
(subject to an adjustment depending on the value of the assumed liabilities) should be issued within 30 days of Admission of Integumen
to AIM. However, prior to completion of the APA, the parties to the APA agreed upon the adjustment to the number of Consideration
Shares to be issued to the Company by Integumen Limited and, consequently at completion, the Company was issued with 2,632,868
Ordinary Shares in full and final satisfaction of the obligations of Integumen Limited and Integumen, Inc to provide consideration
to the Company for the acquisition of the business assets.  

The
Company intends to hold the shares in Integumen as an investment for a minimum of 12 months after Completion to allow for an orderly
transition of the technology and products. After the Completion Date, the Company shall not engage in any business activities
except to the extent necessary to preserve the value of its assets, transfer its assets and knowhow, wind up its business affairs
and give effect to the dissolution of the Company in accordance with the Plan.  

Integumen
was established on May 28, 2016 for the purpose of building a business in the area of Human Surface Science. The acquisition of
Enhance and other complementary businesses in the areas of Skin Science, Oral-health and Wound-care completed by way of the issue
of new shares in Integumen and the assumption of certain liabilities. Integumen plans to seek admission of its shares to trading
on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and plans to raise capital to fund the future development and commercialisation
of its technology portfolio. Integumen has appointed advisors in this regard. Prior to a potential listing and fundraise, Integumen
intends to fund its activities out of existing cash reserves and a bank loan facility for  1m which Venn Life Sciences, the
former owner of one of the acquired businesses currently guarantees.  

Given
the early stage of development of Integumen, uncertainties around the timing of its trading on AIM and the timing and size of
its fundraising it is difficult for the Company to value its investment in Integumen. In addition, there can be no certainty that
there will be a liquid market in the shares of Integumen and whether it will be able to meet its obligations to the Company in
respect of funding the Company s ongoing activities to dissolution.  

The
foregoing, and any subsequent, description of the Option Agreement, Note and the APA does not purport to be complete and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the documents, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5
to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 5, 2016 and Schedule 14C Information Statement filed October
31, 2016.  

These
factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The

with the consulting and employment amendment agreements effective August 1, 2015 and signed on November 19 and November 25, 2015.  

On
February 13, 2013 Mr. Donald Nicholson was appointed to the roles of President, CEO and CFO of the Company. On March 5, 2013 the
Company entered into a consulting agreement with Mercuriali for the services of Mr. Nicholson as the Company s President,
CEO and CFO (the  Mercuriali Consulting Agreement ), as amended by agreements entered effective March 3, 2014, August
1, 2015, March 21, 2016 and October 1, 2016 (the  Mercuriali Amendment Agreements ).  

On
August 14, 2008, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Samuel Asculai, the Company s former President and
Chief Executive Officer. That employment agreement had an initial term of ten (10) years and a base salary of $150,000 per annum.
Pursuant to that employment agreement, Dr. Asculai received a base salary and an annual bonus equal to at least two percent (2%)
of the Company s pre-tax earnings, as defined, for each fiscal year. If Dr. Asculai s employment were to be terminated
without  cause , as defined in that employment agreement, then Dr. Asculai would be entitled to receive all accrued
by unpaid salary and bonus plus a payment equal to two (2) times Dr. Asculai s highest base salary (but not less than $300,000)
plus two (2) times his highest bonus. This payment would be received, at Dr. Asculai s option, in one lump sum or in equal
monthly instalments over a 24 month period.  

On
March 5, 2013, as amended March 3, 2014 Dr. Asculai, and Biostrategies (a company wholly owned by Dr. Asculai) entered a termination
agreement with the Company terminating the employment agreement with Dr. Asculai as President and CEO. Pursuant to this termination
agreement upon the Company substantially completing the Restructuring Plan, Biostrategies and Dr. Asculai forgave all of the unpaid
fees under Dr. Asculai except for $20,031 which amount will be converted into five million three hundred twenty seven thousand
four hundred and sixty (5,327,460) common shares of the Company s stock upon the Company receiving cumulative Transaction
Monies (as such term is defined in the relevant agreements) of at least one hundred and fifty thousand United States dollars ($150,000).
During the year ended April 30, 2013 the Company substantially completed the Restructuring Plan. Resultantly, Dr. Asculai forgave
all of the unpaid fees except for $20,031 which was transferred, together with the associated share conversion, to the balance
of Mr. Puseljic.

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES (continued)   

On
March 5, 2013 Biostrategies entered into a new consulting agreement with the Company for the services of Dr. Asculai as the Company s
CSO (the  Asculai Consulting Agreement ), as amended by agreements entered effective March 3, 2014, August 1, 2015,
March 21, 2016 and October 1, 2016 (the  Asculai Amendment Agreements ).  

Mr.
Puseljic had a 10-year service agreement with the Company to assist in business development, contract administration and co-ordination
of SEC filings with management and the Company s SEC counsel with base fees of $150,000 per annum. At March 5, 2013 Mr.
Puseljic was owed $400,625 in unpaid fees. On March 5, 2013 Mr. Puseljic entered a termination agreement with the company as amended
March 3, 2014 (the  Puseljic Termination Agreement ) terminating the service agreement and pursuant to which upon
the Company substantially completing the Restructuring Plan, Mr. Puseljic forgives all of the unpaid fees except for $20,031.25
which amount will be converted into five million three hundred twenty seven thousand four hundred and sixty (5,327,460) common
shares of the Company s stock upon the Company receiving cumulative Transaction Monies (as such term is defined in the relevant
agreements) of at least one hundred and fifty thousand United States dollars ($150,000).  

On
March 5, 2013 Mr. Puseljic entered into a new employment agreement with the Company (the  Puseljic Employment Agreement ),
as amended by agreements entered effective March 3, 2014, August 1, 2015, March 21, 2016 and October 1, 2016 (the  Puseljic
Amendment Agreements ).  

Under
the Mercuriali Amendment Agreements, the Asculai Amendment Agreements and the Puseljic Amendment Agreements, the Corporation may
be liable to pay $21,000 to each of Mr. Asculai and Mr. Puseljic and $35,500 to Mercuriali for the period August 1, 2015 to October
31, 2015 to be satisfied seventy percent (70%) in common shares of Corporation at $0.0018 and thirty percent (30%) in cash, all
such payments conditional on the receipt of Transaction Monies (as such term is defined in the relevant agreements) of $1,000,000

Amendment Agreement, Asculai Amendment Agreement and Puseljic Amendment Agreement each comprise a monthly retainer of seven thousand
United States dollars (US$7,000) for up to fourteen (14) hours of Services per week, plus one hundred United States dollars ($100)

issued as a result of the conversion of debts owed under existing agreements as of the date of receipt of Transaction Monies under
the APA, including debts owed under certain sections of the Mercuriali Amendment Agreements, the Asculai Amendment Agreements
and the Puseljic Amendment Agreements, as the case may be, and 30% in cash, all such payments to be made within 30 days of the
receipt of Threshhold Funding (as such term is defined in the relevant agreements).

NOTE
8. BUSINESS ACQUISITION   

ASC
Topic 805,  Business Combinations  requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the acquisition
method and that certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill.
ASC Topic 350,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other  ( ASC 350 ) requires goodwill and other identifiable intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized, such as trade names, but instead tested at least annually for impairment
(which the Company tests each year end, absent any impairment indicators) and be written down if impaired. ASC 350 requires that
goodwill be allocated to its respective reporting unit and that identifiable intangible assets with finite lives be amortized
over their useful lives.  

Pursuant
to Share Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) dated October 31, 2015, among the Company, Mercuriali Ltd. a Corporation
incorporated under the laws of United Kingdom (100% owner of issued and outstanding share of Visible Youth Ltd.) and Donald Nicholson,
the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Visible Youth Ltd. for a consideration of $2,500. As a result
of this transaction, Visible Youth Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  

This
acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Visible Youth Ltd. did not have any assets or liabilities
as at October 31, 2015. Goodwill of $1 represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired, less impairment.  

The
Company test for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. In assessing whether goodwill is impaired, the Company utilize
the two-step process as prescribed by ASC 350. The first step of this test compares the fair value of the reporting unit, determined
based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying
amount, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds
the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and step two of the goodwill impairment test would
need to be performed to measure the amount of an impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the impairment is computed by comparing
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount
of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss in the amount
of the excess is recognized and charged to statement of operations.  

Management
decided to immediately impair goodwill amounting to $2,499 and brought it at $1 as Visible Youth Ltd. was inactive as at October
31, 2015. Visible Youth Limited remains inactive as at October 31, 2016. As part of the APA the Company sold all of its shares
in Visible Youth Ltd. to Integumen on December 2, 2016.

Review
of Operations   

During
the quarter the Company has continued prosecution and protection of its patent and trademark portfolio. On August 12, 2015, the
Company entered into a services agreement with Snowbell Management Limited ( Snowbell ) to project manage and develop
the Visible Youth  consumer skin care brand for its relaunch. The project encompasses refining the brand plan and product
briefs and involves the management and development of the brand and product line from re-formulation and re-branding through to
delivered finished goods. During 2015 the Company engaged a product formulation and manufacturing company and is currently in
the final stages of reformulating its first six products. In addition, during 2015 the Company engaged a design consultancy to
create its new brand identity and packaging, encompassing both the Visible Youth consumer and professional brands. The work is
well advanced and the new formulations and brand identity are substantially completed. The first six formulations are currently
on three months accelerated stability testing. The Company then intends to conduct various challenge and compatibility tests with
a view to the start of pilot manufacture and the commencement of certain marketing clinical studies for certain of the Visible
Youth products as soon as resources are available. The exact nature of these studies are currently being evaluated by the Company
and its advisors. It is expected that final study results will be available approximately four months after their start. In the
opinion of the board, these further marketing studies are necessary to refine the marketing strategy and to obtain further funding
on acceptable terms. If study results are satisfactory and necessary funding can be obtained, management aims to re-launch the
Visible Youth products in the consumer markets in Europe and the USA approximately six to nine months from clinical study completion.  

During
the period management was also focused on concluding the APA with Integumen which Completed on December 2, 2016.

As
at October 31, 2016 the Company had $5,705 of cash on hand, an increase of $2,858 from April 30, 2016 balance of $2,847, mainly
due to proceeds from issuance of a secured promissory note from Integumen Limited and advances from Mercuriali Ltd. net of increase
in payments.  

Goodwill

Goodwill
of $1 represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired, less impairment.  

Pursuant
to Share Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) dated October 31, 2015, among the Company, Mercuriali Ltd. a Corporation
incorporated under the laws of United Kingdom (100% owner of issued and outstanding share of Visible Youth Ltd.) and Donald Nicholson,
the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Visible Youth Ltd. for a consideration of $2,500. As a result
of this transaction, Visible Youth Ltd. became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Management decided to immediately impair
goodwill amounting to $2,499 and brought it at $1 as Visible Youth Ltd. was inactive as at October 31, 2015. As part of the APA
the Company sold all of its shares in Visible Youth Ltd. to Integumen on December 2, 2016.

Advances
from a related party convertible into shares   

As
at October 31, 2016 advances from a related party convertible into shares was $316,575, an increase of $11,035 from April 30,
2016 balance of $305,540. The increase represents additional advances from Mercuriali Limited to meet the working capital requirements
of the Company prior to the issue of the secured promissory note to Integumen Limited.  

Secured
promissory note   

On
July 7, 2016, the Company issued a secured promissory note ( Note ) to Integumen Limited under which Integumen agreed
to loan the Company US$100,000 conditional upon the Company entering into an Option Agreement and entering into good faith negotiations
with a view to entering into a strategic collaboration via an Asset Purchase Agreement ( APA ). The full balance was
due on the earlier of (i) the demand made by the Noteholder or on the 6 month anniversary date (ii) the completion of the APA
or (iii) when, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default. . In the event of non-payment, the company
becomes due to pay 5% per annum of the outstanding principal from the Maturity date. The APA was completed on December 2, 2016
and the Note repaid. As of October 31, 2016, no interest has been accrued on the Note.  

Statement
of Operations   Three and six months ended Ontario 31, 2016 balances compared to three and six months ended October 31,
2015   

Sales   

Current
and previous period nominal sales represent sales of our existing Visible Youth products through the Company s existing
website primarily to existing customers.  

Expenses   

Our
expenses are classified primarily into the following categories.  

General
and administrative.     

General
and administrative expenses incurred for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 were $2,290 and $10,710 compared to $7,352
and $11,639 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is mainly
due to additional expenditures related to package design fees and general accruals during the 2015 period ended October 30, 2015.  

Legal
and professional fees.    

Legal
and professional fees incurred for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 were $166,769 and $333,116 compared to $138,019
and $155,317 for the three and six months ended October 31, 2015. The significant increase for the three and six months amount
is mainly due to the recording of $205,100 management fees in connection with consulting and employment agreement amendments,
project management fees and costs associated with product formulation and branding and business development costs, partly offset
by a fall in patents registration activities and related costs in the three and six months period ended October 31, 2016, respectively.  

Interest
expense.    

Interest
expense for the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 were nil and $7,821 compared to $30,596 and $37,739 for the three
and six months ended October 31, 2015. The major reason for the decrease in the three and six months period is mainly due to the
decrease in expenses in connection with the beneficial conversion feature of the advances from a related party convertible into
shares, expensed immediately due to short term conversion terms of these advances.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

During
the three and six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company raised $100,000 through issuance of a secured convertible note and
Mercuriali Ltd. made advances to the Company of $11,035. At October 31, 2016 the total advances from Mercuriali Ltd. were $316,575.  

ITEM
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)   

At
October 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $1,319,224 compared to a working capital deficit of $995,024 at
April 30, 2016. The increase in working capital deficit is due to increase in current liabilities from the secured promissory
note, management fees in connection with consulting and employment agreement amendments, and from advances made by Mercuriali
Ltd.  

At
October 31, 2016 the total assets were $7,532 as compared to the total assets $2,848 at April 30, 2016. The increase of $4,684
is mainly due to an increase on cash balances and prepaid expenses during the three and six months ended October 31, 2016.  

Income
Taxes   

At
October 31, 2016, the Company had potential unused net operating loss carryovers of approximately $3,435,046 (April 30, 2016:
$3,089,331). These losses may be available to offset taxable income in the future and to the extent available will expire between
2027 and 2032. The Company has recently filed tax returns in the US for the periods ended April 30, 2012 to April 30, 2016 and
has filed its Federal tax returns in Canada for all periods to April 30, 2016. Reviews of the respective tax returns may have
an impact on the amount of net operating loss carryovers which might be available to the Company. No deferred tax asset attributable
to the net operating loss carry forward has been recognized, as based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than
not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  

Financing   

During
the three and six months ended October 31, 2016 the Company relied on proceeds from the issuance of a secured promissory note
to Integumen Limited and advances from Mercuriali Ltd., a related party.

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures    

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures .  

We
recently evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or
Rule 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report, being October 31, 2016.
This evaluation was conducted with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer.  

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that the
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
on their evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective in giving us reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose
in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Principal Executive and Principal Financial Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. This conclusion was based on the existence of significant deficiencies in
our internal control over financial reporting previously disclosed and discussed below.  

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures (continued)   

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls
and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute
assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls
and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  

Management
Report on internal control over financial reporting .  

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for
preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets
are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute
assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.  

Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and identified significant deficiencies
in internal control over financial reporting.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over the financial reporting, such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis.  

A
significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important
enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting. Currently, we do not have sufficient
in-house expertise in US GAAP reporting. Instead, we rely very much on the expertise and knowledge of external financial advisors
in US GAAP conversion. External financial advisors have helped prepare and review our consolidated financial statements. To remediate
this situation, we are seeking to recruit experienced professionals to augment and upgrade our financial staff to address issues
of timeliness and completeness in US GAAP financial reporting as soon as resources are available. In addition, we do not believe
we have sufficient documentation with our existing financial processes, risk assessment and internal controls. We plan to work
closely with external financial advisors to document the existing financial processes, risk assessment and internal controls systematically
as soon as resources are available. To address the need for more effective internal controls, management has plans to improve
the existing controls and implement new controls appropriate to a business of its size and scale as our financial position and
capital availability improves. In addition the Company intends to seek to strengthen the composition of its Board of Directors.  

Although
we have not identified any material weaknesses with our financial reporting or any other significant deficiencies with our internal
controls, no assurances can be given that there are no such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies existing.  

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting .  

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarters and have
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION    

ITEM
1. Legal Proceedings    

The
Company received a Section 45 Notice from the Canadian Intellectual Property Office dated December 18, 2012 requesting that the
Company, in accordance with Section 45 of the  Trade-marks Act , furnish evidence within three months from the date of the
notice demonstrating use of the trademark Visible Youth in Canada at any time during the three year period immediately preceding
the date of the notice. The Company provided such evidence in the form of an affidavit on March 14, 2013. On August 26, 2013 the
Company received of the response of the purported requesting party, Glycobiosciences Inc. ( Glycobiosciences ) response,
dated August 12, 2013, to its evidence. The Company filed its response to that submission on December 23, 2013.  

On
January 9, 2014 Glycobiosciences requested an oral hearing, which was held on June 25, 2014. On September 17, 2014 the Company
was informed that the Canadian Intellectual Property Office issued a decision dated September 7, 2014 rejecting the Section 45
application and maintaining the Company s Canadian trademark. On November 13, 2014 the Company was informed that the applicant
has appealed this decision to the Federal Court of Canada. The Company filed a Notice of Appearance with the Federal Court of
Canada on November 21, 2014 indicating that it intends to oppose this application. On January 20, 2015 the Company filed further
evidence in the form of an affidavit with the Court.  

On
April 20, 2015, the Company received a notice of Change of Solicitors from Glycobiosciences, the alleged requesting party. Glycobiosciences
had not filed a response in a timely manner and on April 24, 2015 the Company filed a response requesting that the matter be dismissed
for delay. On April 28, 2015 the Company was notified by the Federal Court that the alleged applicant will be required to bring
a Motion requesting an extension of time to file a response. On July 8, 2015 the Federal Court issued a Notice of Status Review
because more than 180 days have elapsed since the issuance of the Notice of Application. On July 23, 2015, the Applicant served
and filed representations stating the reasons why they believed that the proceeding should not be dismissed for delay. On July
30, 2015 the Company filed its written Submissions in response. On August 6, 2015 the Applicant filed its reply to the Company s
response. On August 19, 2015 the Federal Court found that the application should not be dismissed for delay and ordered that the
application proceed as a specially managed proceeding under a Case Management Judge. On September 16, 2015 a Case Management Judge
was appointed. Despite repeated attempts both Glycobiosciences and its attorneys failed to supply dates for a case management
teleconference and subsequently informed the Company that it was no longer represented by attorneys. Consequently, on November
17, 2015 the Company again asked the Federal Court that the matter be dismissed for delay. Glycobiosciences was given until December
19, 2015 by the Federal Court to retain new counsel in this matter. . On December 8, 2015 Glycobiosciences retained new counsel.
On January 12, 2016 Glycobiosciences discontinued the case putting an end to the Section 45 proceedings. As a result, the Company
maintains its Canadian trademark.  

In
the course of preparing the affidavit in the Section 45 proceedings, the Company discovered that Glycobiosciences has been offering
for sale and selling  VISIBLE YOUTH VY  anti-aging revitalizing formula containing hyaluronate sodium to the public.
The Company also discovered that on December 20, 2012, Glycobiosciences filed a Canadian trademark application to register VISIBLE
YOUTH for cosmetics. On March 13, 2013, the Company filed a Notice of Infringement of Trademark on Glycobiosciences. . On April
9, 2015 the Company filed a Statement of Claim against Glycobiosciences in the Federal Court of Canada claiming, amongst other
matters, infringement of our Visible Youth trademark and seeking damages. On May 29, 2015 the defendant filed a Statement of Defence
and Counterclaim denying each of the allegations in our Statement of Claim and allege that they are not using the trademark Visible
Youth. The Company filed its Reply and Defence to the Counterclaim on June 29, 2015. The defendant had until July 9. 2015 to file
a reply. As no reply was received the pleadings closed on July 9, 2015. Consequently, on August 25, 2015 the Company served its
Affidavit of Documents on Glycobiosciences Inc. On August 25, 2015 an Affidavit of Documents was received from Glycobiosciences.
The Company responded on September 4, 2015 and has had no response. In the absence of a response from Glycobiosciences, and in
response to a status review of July 20, 2016 the Company filed a proposed timetable for the progression of this action with the
Federal Court. On August 24, 2016 the Federal Court issued a written Direction granting our requested timetable. On November 8,
2016, the Federal Court at the request of Glycobiosciences, granted an extension of time until January 31, 2017, to complete examinations
for discovery. It also set the due date of February 15, 2017, for the parties to file written submissions as to the following
steps.  

The
Company has been in correspondence with the defendant and its respective attorneys since September 17, 2015 concerning a settlement
of outstanding matters and since January 12 concerning costs in respect of Section 45 proceeding. Communication from the defendant
is however slow and infrequent.  

ITEM
1. Legal Proceedings (continued)   

The
Company received a further Section 45 Notice by Glycobiosciences from the Canadian Intellectual Property Office dated June 22,
2016 requesting that the Company, in accordance with Section 45 of the  Trade-marks Act , furnish evidence within three months
from the date of the notice demonstrating use of the trademark Visible Youth in Canada at any time during the three year period
immediately preceding the date of the notice. On September 15, 2016, the Company filed evidence of its sales and use of its trademark
in Canada during the period.  

On
September 17, 2015 the Company discovered that Glycobiosciences had applied for and been granted a trademark for Visible Youth
in the European Union on May 10, 2015. No system of searches for prior trademark registration exists in the European Union prior
to grant. On September 18, 2015 the Company filed an application for a declaration of invalidity of Glycobiosciences trademark
due to the Company s earlier granted trademark. On March 18, 2016 Glycobiosciences filed a response to the Company s
application for invalidity. On June 6, 2016 the Company filed its response and Glycobiosciences had until August 14, 2016 to submit
their reply. On September 6, 2016 the Company was informed that Glycobiosciences had applied for and been granted an extension
to October 14, 2016 to submit their reply. The Company intends to vigorously defend its Visible Youth trademark.  

On
September 6, 2016 the Company was informed that Glycobiosciences had applied for a revocation of Company s granted EU trademark
for non-use in the EU. On November 24, 2016, the Company filed its response providing evidence of its use of its trademark in
the EU during the period.  

On
May 18, 2016 the Company filed applications for a new Visible Youth Trademark and its new VY logo in the European Union. On August
17 the Company was informed that Glycobiosciences has filed an opposition to the Visible Youth trademark based on its granted
EU trademark which the Company is in the process of seeking to invalidate. The Company has requested that the opposition proceedings
be suspended pending the outcome of its invalidation proceedings. On September 6, 2016 the Company was informed that Glycobiosciences
had applied for and been granted a suspension of the Company s invalidation proceedings pending the outcome of Glycobiosciences
revocation procedure in respect of Company s granted EU trademark. The Company is in process of opposing the suspension.  

On
June 19, 2012, the Company entered into a written Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Age Reversal,
Inc., a Maryland corporation ( ARI ) as disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements for the year ended April
30, 2012. On January 14, 2013, the Company received notice from ARI that ARI was withdrawing from the proposed merger with the
Company to pursue other options. ARI thereby terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on June 19, 2012 and the
Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on August 31, 2012 between the Company and ARI. The Company and ARI have
had discussions over ARI s obligations on termination of the Merger Agreement to reimburse the company for certain expenses
of the Merger. Pursuant to Section 7.1(b) of the Merger Agreement, the Company has demanded payment of the ESP Expense Reimbursement
(as defined in the Merger Agreement) of $40,000 it claims is due under the Merger Agreement. ARI claims that it has reimbursed,
advanced or otherwise paid to date amounts that satisfy this obligation. The Company continues to maintain that ARI owes the ESP
Expense Reimbursement of $40,000 under the Merger Agreement. The  

Company
has not as yet started legal proceeding against ARI due to its financial position, but reserves the right to commence proceedings
once it has obtained adequate funding.
