1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ENTITY STRUCTURE 
  Business 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Armstrong Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries and controlled entities (collectively, the Company or AE). The Company s primary business is the production of thermal coal from surface and underground mines located in western Kentucky, for sale to utility and industrial markets. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Prior to September 1, 2016, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Elk Creek GP, LLC (ECGP), was the sole general partner of and had an approximate   0.2%   ownership in Thoroughbred Resources, L.P. (Thoroughbred). The various limited partners of Thoroughbred are related parties, as the entity is majority owned by investment funds managed by Yorktown Partners LLC (Yorktown), which has a majority ownership in the Company.  Effective September 1, 2016, Yorktown exercised its right under the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Thoroughbred Resources, LP to remove ECGP as the general partner of Thoroughbred.   The Company does not consolidate the financial results of Thoroughbred.  See Note 7, "Related Party Transactions," for further discussion. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial reporting and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal, recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Balance sheet information presented herein as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company s audited consolidated balance sheet at that date. Results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2016 presentation. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 23, 2016. 
  Market Conditions and Liquidity 
  The domestic coal markets have been negatively impacted by declining power demand from mild weather conditions, persistently low natural gas prices, excess utility stockpiles and an arduous regulatory environment.  As a result of the weak market conditions and depressed coal prices, the Company has undertaken steps to adequately preserve its liquidity and manage operating costs, including efficiently controlling capital expenditures. Beginning in 2015, the Company undertook steps to enhance its financial flexibility and reduce cash outflows in the near term, including a streamlining of its cost structure and anticipated reductions in production volumes and capital expenditures.  In addition, during the second quarter of 2016, the board of directors of the Company authorized an exploration of strategic alternatives aimed at strengthening the Company s balance sheet and improving its long-term capital structure.  As a result, the Company has retained legal and financial advisers to assist the board of directors and management with the strategic review process.  There is no assurance that this exploration will result in any strategic alternatives being announced or executed.  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company has incurred expenses totaling   $626   and   $1,077  , respectively, associated with the strategic review process, which is included as a component of "other, net" in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.   
  Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented 
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance regarding the accounting for leases.  This update requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. This update will be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the requirement to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent.  The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this standard as of December 31, 2015.  While the adoption of this guidance impacted the Company's balance sheet disclosure, it did not affect the Company's results of operations or cash flows.   
  In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance requiring an entity to present deferred financing costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability as opposed to an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. In August 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update about the presentation and subsequent measurement of deferred financing costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, which allows for the presentation of deferred financing costs as an asset regardless of whether or not there is an outstanding balance on the line-of-credit arrangement. The updates are effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted these standards during the three months ended March 31, 2016.  The Company continues to report the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with its asset-based revolving credit facility dated December 21, 2012 (the 2012 Credit Facility) within other non-current assets, whereas unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company's   11.75%   Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the Notes) have been reclassified for all periods presented.  
  In February 2015, the FASB issued guidance changing the requirements and analysis required when determining the reporting entity's need to consolidate an entity, including modifying the evaluation of limited partnerships variable interest status, the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and the consolidation criterion applied by a reporting entity involved with variable interest entities.  The Company adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2016, and it did not have an impact on its historical consolidation conclusions. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services. The standard permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new pronouncement on its financial statements. 
   
  2. ASSET IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 
  The Company's long-lived assets may be adversely affected by numerous uncertain factors that may cause the Company to be unable to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of those assets.  As a result of various unfavorable market conditions, including, but not limited to sustained downward trends in domestic coal prices, the Company concluded indicators of impairment existed as of   September 30, 2015  .  As such, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its long-lived assets for recoverability through future cash flows as of   September 30, 2015  .  Based on that review, it was determined the carrying value was not recoverable, and the Company correspondingly recognized a non-cash asset impairment of    $137,678   to reduce the carrying value of its long-lived assets to their estimated fair value.  In addition, the Company initiated certain restructuring activities during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   to better align its cost structure with current industry conditions.  Costs associated with these restructuring activities of    $1,001   were recognized in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For additional information surrounding those charges, refer to Note 3, "Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges" to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized an asset impairment charge of   $3,381   to write-off certain advanced royalties.  See Note 3, "Mineral Reserve Lease," for further discussion.  

3.  MINERAL RESERVE LEASE 
    
  In October 2010, the Company entered into a lease agreement for over   100 million   tons of recoverable coal reserves located in Union and Webster Counties, Kentucky in exchange for a production royalty.  The initial term of the lease expired on   June 1, 2016  .  In addition, the lease required the Company to provide the lessor with a certain amount of coal tonnage annually until production commenced on the leased reserve.  The Company valued this coal tonnage using the prevailing average market price, and the advance royalty was recoupable against production royalties generated by future mining activity.   
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

Upon expiration, the lease was renewed for an additional   5   year term.  The terms of the renewal stipulate a minimum annual rent payable with a specified amount of coal tonnage beginning on June 1, 2017.  In addition, the lease allows for the early termination of the agreement by the Company upon payment of a termination fee, as defined, which is   zero   through December 1, 2017.  Lastly, the minimum annual rent, including amounts previously paid, will no longer be recoupable against future production royalties.  As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of   $3,381   during the second quarter of 2016 to write-off advanced royalties associated with the aforementioned lease.

7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  Investments 
  Effective September 1, 2016, Yorktown exercised its right under the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Thoroughbred Resources, LP to remove ECGP as the general partner of Thoroughbred.  The Company received cash of   $500   for its   0.2%   general partner interest and recognized a pre-tax loss of   $320   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , which is included as a component of "other, net" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The Company continues to maintain a   0.9%   interest in Thoroughbred through its subsidiary, Armstrong Energy Holdings, Inc., but, as a result of its removal as general partner, no longer has the ability to exercise significant influence over Thoroughbred.  Therefore, effective September 1, 2016, the remaining interest being retained by the Company is being accounted for under the cost method.

     Table of Contents  

Prior to September 1, 2016 when the Company s investment in Thoroughbred was accounted for under the equity method, the Company recognized income from its equity interest of   $25   and   $40   for   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $89   and   $116   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
  Sale of Coal Reserves 
  The Company has executed the sale of an undivided interest in certain land and mineral reserves in Ohio and Muhlenberg counties of Kentucky to Thoroughbred, through a series of transactions beginning in February 2011. Subsequently, the Company entered into lease agreements with Thoroughbred pursuant to which Thoroughbred granted the Company leases to its undivided interests in the mining properties acquired and licenses to mine and sell coal from those properties in exchange for a production royalty. Due to the Company s continuing involvement in the land and mineral reserves transferred, these transactions have been accounted for as financing arrangements. A long-term obligation has been established that is being amortized over the anticipated life of the mineral reserves, at an annual rate of   7%   of the estimated gross revenue generated from the sale of the coal originating from the leased mineral reserves. In addition, effective February 2011, the Company and Thoroughbred entered into a Royalty Deferment and Option Agreement, whereby the Company has been granted an option to defer payment of any royalties earned by Thoroughbred on coal mined from these properties. Compensation for the aforementioned transactions has consisted of a combination of cash payments and the forgiveness of amounts owed by the Company, which primarily consisted of deferred royalties. 
  On May 1, 2015, the Company sold a   12.10%   undivided interest in certain leased and owned land and mineral reserves to Thoroughbred in exchange for Thoroughbred forgiving amounts owed by the Company of   $18,172  . On June 1, 2016, the Company sold an additional   17.81%   undivided interest in certain leased and owned land and mineral reserves to Thoroughbred in exchange for Thoroughbred forgiving amounts owed by the Company of   $16,413  .  The amounts forgiven consisted primarily of deferred production royalties. The newly acquired interests in the mineral reserves were leased and/or subleased by Thoroughbred to the Company in exchange for a production royalty. These transactions were accounted for as financing arrangements and additional long-term obligations to Thoroughbred of    $18,172   and    $16,413   were recognized on May 1, 2015 and June 1, 2016, respectively. 
  The percentage interest in the land and mineral reserves sold to Thoroughbred in the above transactions were based on fair values determined by a third-party specialist as of December 31 of the year prior to the completion of the land and mineral reserve sale. In addition, these transactions were approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the Company, a committee including independent directors.  As a result of the above, Thoroughbred s undivided interest in certain of the Company s leased and owned land and mineral reserves in Muhlenberg and Ohio counties as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   79.19%   and   61.38%  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the outstanding long-term obligation to related party totaled   $145,141   and   $128,809  , respectively. Interest expense recognized for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   associated with the long-term obligation to related party was   $2,120   and   $2,675  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $5,474   and   $8,311  , respectively.  The effective interest rate of the long-term obligation to related party, which is adjusted based on significant mine plan changes and the completion of the periodic reserve transfers, was   5.8%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Lease of Coal Reserves 
  In February 2011, Thoroughbred entered into a lease and sublease agreement with the Company relating to its Elk Creek reserves and granted the Company a license to mine coal on those properties. The terms of this agreement mirror those of the lease agreements associated with the jointly owned reserves between the Company and Thoroughbred. Total production royalties owed from mining of the Elk Creek reserves, where the Company s Kronos underground mine resides, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   totaled   $1,867   and   $1,980  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   totaled   $5,206   and   $6,034  , respectively. 
  Administrative Services Agreements 
  The Company entered into an administrative services agreement with Thoroughbred and ECGP pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide Thoroughbred with general administrative and management services, including, but not limited to, human resources, information technology, financial and accounting services and legal services. The administrative service fee, which is adjusted annually, is approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the Company. As consideration for the use of the Company s employees and services, and for certain shared fixed costs, Thoroughbred paid the Company   $236    
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

and   $300   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $707   and   $900   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  In connection with ECGP's removal as general partner of Thoroughbred, the Company and Thoroughbred have agreed to cancel the administrative services agreement effective as of December 31, 2016.   
  Other 
  In 2007, the Company entered into an overriding royalty agreement with an executive employee to compensate him   $0.05  /ton of coal mined and sold from properties owned by certain subsidiaries of the Company. The agreement remains in effect for the later of   20 years   from the date of the agreement or until all salable coal has been extracted. The royalty agreement transfers with the property regardless of ownership or lease status. The royalty is payable the month following the sale of coal mined from the specified properties. The Company accounts for this royalty arrangement as expense in the period in which the coal is sold. Expense recorded in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $54   and   $75  , respectively, and   $154   and   $244   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

8. LONG-TERM DEBT 
  The Company s total indebtedness consisted of the following: 

Senior Secured Notes due 2019 
  On December 21, 2012, the Company completed a   $200,000   offering of the Notes. The Notes were issued at an original issue discount (OID) of   96.567%  . The OID was recorded on the Company s balance sheet as a component of long-term debt, and is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Notes. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the unamortized OID was   $3,870   and   $4,581  , respectively. Interest on the Notes is due semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Company used   $123,698   of the proceeds from this issuance to prepay and terminate its previous senior secured credit facility, including accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the Company used the proceeds to pay fees and expenses of   $8,358   related to the Notes offering, which are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Notes.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the unamortized deferred financing costs were   $5,535   and   $6,529  , respectively. 
  2012 Credit Facility 
  Concurrently with the closing of the Notes offering on December 21, 2012, the Company entered into the 2012 Credit Facility. The 2012 Credit Facility provides for a   five   year,   $50,000   revolving credit facility that will expire on   December 21, 2017  . Borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility may not exceed a borrowing base, as defined within the 2012 Credit Facility agreement. In addition, the 2012 Credit Facility includes a   $10,000   letter of credit sub-facility and a   $5,000   swingline loan sub-facility. The Company incurred   $1,198   of deferred financing fees related to the 2012 Credit Facility that have been capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2012 Credit Facility. 
  The 2012 Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, and a failure to comply with the financial covenants could adversely impact the Company's available liquidity.  Upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event, at any time when borrowings are outstanding under the facility, the Company will be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, calculated as of the end of each calendar month for the 12 months then ended, greater than   1.0  -to-1.0. A Liquidity Event is defined as the occurrence of (i) an Event of Default, as such term is defined in the 2012 Credit Agreement, or (ii) undrawn availability being less than the greater of (a) $10,000 or (b) an amount equal to 20% of the borrowing base.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio was less than 1.0-to-1.0, which, therefore, would require the Company to maintain minimum availability of $10,000 if any amounts were drawn on the 2012 Credit Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the 2012 Credit Facility, and, therefore, the Company was not subject to the requirements of the financial covenants included within the agreement. The calculated available borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility totaled   $14,399   at   September 30, 2016  , but due to the restrictions imposed as a result of not maintaining the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, the Company's borrowing availability has been reduced by $10,000 to

$4,399  .  As a result of the decline in availability, on November 4, 2016, the Company provided notification to the administrative agent of its intent to terminate the 2012 Credit Facility effective November 14, 2016.   
  Other Debt 
  Other debt consists of miscellaneous debt obligations entered into to finance the acquisition of certain equipment and land.  These obligations have various maturities of one to five years and bear interest at rates between   2.99%   to   6.50%  .   

9. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  The Company measures the fair value of assets and liabilities using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2 inputs, other than quoted market prices in active markets, which are observable, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. In addition, the Company may use various valuation techniques, including the market approach, using comparable market prices; the income approach, using the present value of future income or cash flow; and the cost approach, using the replacement cost of assets. 
  The Company s financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, cost method investment, long-term debt, and other long-term obligations. For cash equivalents, accounts receivable and other long-term obligations, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity and financial nature of the balances. The fair value of the cost method investment is not estimated, as it is impracticable to do so.  The estimated fair market values of the Company s Notes, which was determined using Level 2 inputs, and long-term obligation to related party, which was determined using Level 3 inputs, are as follows: 

The fair value of the Notes is based on quoted market prices, while the fair value of the long-term obligation to related party is based on estimated cash flows discounted to their present value. 

10. INCOME TAXES 
  The Company has not recognized certain income tax benefits, as it does not believe it is more likely than not it will be able to realize its net deferred tax assets. The Company has, therefore, established a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Based on the anticipated reversals of its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, the Company has concluded a valuation allowance is necessary only for the excess of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities. 

11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
  The Company provides certain health care benefits, including the reimbursement of a portion of out-of-pocket costs associated with insurance coverage, to qualifying salaried and hourly retirees and their dependents. Plan coverage for reimbursements will be provided to future hourly and salaried retirees in accordance with the plan document. The Company s funding policy with respect to the plan is to fund the cost of all postretirement benefits as they are paid.

13. CLOSURE OF LEWIS CREEK UNDERGROUND MINE 
  The Company s Lewis Creek underground mine, which produced coal from the West Kentucky #9 seam, experienced significant operating inefficiencies due to the geological conditions of the portion of the reserve being mined. As a result of the ongoing mining difficulties, a final decision was made in August 2014 not to continue advancing under the existing mine plan, but rather to retreat and mine only in the eastern portion of the reserve. 
  The Company completed mining of the Lewis Creek underground mine in March 2015 and has extracted the equipment, which will be utilized at its other mining operations in the future. As a result of the closure, the Company accelerated depreciation of the remaining net book value of the capitalized costs associated with the original development of the mine. Total expense recognized during the first quarter of 2015 to write-off the remaining asset was approximately   $6,318  , which was included as a component of "depreciation, depletion, and amortization" in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  The Company is subject to various market, operational, financial, regulatory, and legislative risks. Numerous federal, state, and local governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. Federal and state regulations require regular monitoring of mines and other facilities to document compliance. Monetary penalties of   $1,141   and   $901   related to Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) fines were accrued as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The Company is involved from time to time in various legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated cash flows, results of operations or financial condition.  A summary of the significant legal matters is below. 
  Litigation 
  On July 20, 2016 the Company was notified by an Assistant U. S. Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky of an investigation into potential charges against Armstrong Coal Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and one or more of its current and former employees arising from alleged inaccurate respirable dust sampling at certain of the Company's underground mines.  In January 2014, MSHA issued a 104(d) citation to the Parkway underground mine related to inaccurate respirable dust sampling, which the Company has challenged.   In addition, a Parkway underground mine employee was terminated.  The impact of any charges against the Company or its current and former employees cannot be determined at this time, and we intend to vigorously defend any such charges should they be pursued.          
  Coal Sales Contracts 
  The Company has historically sold the majority of its coal under multi-year supply agreements of varying duration. These contracts typically have specific volume and pricing arrangements for each year of the agreement, which allows customers to secure a supply for their future needs and provides the Company with greater predictability of sales volume and sales prices. Quantities sold under some of these contracts may vary from year to year within certain limits at the option of the customer or the Company. The remaining terms of the Company s long-term contracts range from   one   to   four   years. The Company, via contractual agreements, has committed volumes of sales in   2016   of approximately   5.9 million   tons. 

15. OTHER, NET 
  During the second quarter 2015, the Company received a refund for a portion of the Kentucky sales and use taxes paid on the purchase of certain energy and energy producing fuels for the period of 2008 through 2013.  The refund, including interest, totaled   $4,482  , which is included in "other, net" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

16. SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR/NON-GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
  In accordance with the indenture governing the Notes, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (each, a Guarantor Subsidiary) have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Notes, on a joint and several basis, subject to certain customary release provisions. Separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning the Guarantor Subsidiaries are not presented because management believes that such information is not material to the holders of the Notes. The following historical financial statement information is provided for the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The non-guarantor subsidiaries are considered to be  minor  as the term is defined in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC, and the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are, therefore, included in the condensed financial data of the Guarantor Subsidiaries.

  Overview 
  Armstrong Energy, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, we or the Company) is a producer of low chlorine, high sulfur thermal coal from the Illinois Basin, with both surface and underground mines. We market our coal primarily to proximate and investment-grade electric utility companies as fuel for their steam-powered generators. Based on 2015 production, we are the fifth largest producer in the Illinois Basin and the second largest in Western Kentucky. We were formed in 2006 to acquire and develop a large coal reserve holding. We commenced production in the second quarter of 2008 and currently operate six mines, including three surface and three underground. We control approximately   554 million   tons of proven and probable coal reserves. We also own and operate three coal processing plants, which support our mining operations. From our reserves, we mine coal from multiple seams that, in combination with our coal processing facilities, enhance our ability to meet customer requirements for blends of coal with different characteristics. The locations of our coal reserves and operations, adjacent to the Green River, together with our river dock coal handling and rail loadout facilities, allow us to optimize coal blending and handling, and provide our customers with rail, barge and truck transportation options. 
  We market our coal primarily to large utilities with coal-fired, base-load, scrubbed power plants under multi-year coal supply agreements. Our multi-year coal supply agreements usually have specific volume and pricing arrangements for each year of the agreement. These agreements allow customers to secure a supply for their future needs and provide us with greater predictability of sales volume and sales prices. At   September 30, 2016  , we had coal supply agreements with terms ranging from   one   to   four   years. As of   September 30, 2016  , we are contractually committed to sell approximately   5.9 million   tons of coal in 2016.  
  Recent Developments 
  Review of Strategic Alternatives 
            During the second quarter of 2016, our board of directors authorized an exploration of strategic alternatives aimed at strengthening our balance sheet and improving our long-term capital structure.  We have retained MAEVA Group, LLC as our financial adviser and Kirkland   Ellis LLP as our legal adviser to assist the board of directors and management with the strategic review process.  We do not expect to provide any additional information on this process unless and until deemed appropriate or necessary. There is no assurance that this exploration will result in any strategic alternatives being announced or executed.  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company has incurred expenses totaling   $0.6 million   and    $1.1 million  , respectively, associated with the strategic review process, which is included as a component of "other, net" in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Production Rationalization 
  On April 22, 2016, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act notices were delivered to employees of one of our mining operations and related preparation plant in anticipation of closing the Parkway underground mine.  During the second quarter of 2016, the decision was made to continue operating the Parkway underground mine until all economically recoverable coal was depleted and, in October 2016, the mine ultimately depleted its economically recoverable reserves and ceased production.  

Results of Operations 
  Non-GAAP Financial Information 
  Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). It is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as measures of our liquidity. 
  We define  Adjusted EBITDA  as net income (loss) before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset retirement obligation expenses, costs incurred evaluating strategic alternatives, non-cash production royalty to related party, asset impairment and restructuring charges, loss on settlement of interest rate swap, loss on deferment of equity offering, non-cash stock compensation expense (income), non-cash employee benefit expense, non-cash charges related to non-recourse notes, gain on deconsolidation, and (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is useful to an investor in evaluating our Company. We also include a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial performance measure, which is net income (loss), in the sections that follow.

     Revenue 
  Our coal sales revenue for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased by   $23.8 million  , or   26.7%  , to   $65.4 million  , as compared to   $89.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease is attributable to an unfavorable volume variance of approximately   $18.8 million   year-over-year due to a decline in customer demand resulting in lower contracted amounts in the current year and an unfavorable price variance of approximately   $5.0 million   due to the renewal of sales contracts at less favorable prices, as well as unfavorable transportation adjustments included as a component of the price in certain of our long-term coal supply agreements as a result of declining diesel prices, as compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Cost of Coal Sales 
  Cost of coal sales decreased   25.0%   to   $52.4 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $69.8 million   in the same period of   2015  . The decline is primarily attributable to selling   0.4 million   tons less. On a per ton basis, our cost of coal sales decreased during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , from   $36.19   per ton to   $34.38   per ton. This decrease in per ton amount is primarily due to lower diesel fuel costs and lower blasting costs at our surface operations due to a higher amount of unconsolidated overburden, as well as lower equipment rental and equipment repair expenses, as compared to the prior year quarter.   
  Production Royalty to Related Party 
  Production royalty to related party declined   $0.1 million  , or   5.8%  , to   $1.9 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of   2015  . This amount relates to production royalties earned by our affiliate, Thoroughbred, from sales originating from our Kronos underground mine (where the mineral reserves are leased directly from Thoroughbred). The reduction is primarily due to sales volume declines experienced at our Kronos underground mine during the current quarter, partially offset by higher average sales prices in the current quarter, as compared to the same period of   2015  , due to a favorable customer mix. See Note 7, "Related Party Transactions," to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to Thoroughbred. 
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 
  Depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD A) expense decreased by   $3.3 million  , or   29.6%  , to   $7.7 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of   2015  . The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in depletion in the current year as a result of lower production levels and a reduction in the asset base due to the impairment charge recognized in the third quarter of 2015. 
  Asset Retirement Obligation Expenses 
  Asset retirement obligation expenses decreased by   $0.4 million  , or   53.7%  , to   $0.4 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of   2015  . The decrease is primarily attributable to changes in asset retirement cost estimates based on revisions to discount rates, reserve valuations and projected mine lives. 
  Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges 
   During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized asset impairment and restructuring charges of zero and   $138.7 million  , respectively.  The prior year charge was primarily associated with the write-down of the carrying value of our long-lived assets to their estimated fair value.  See Note 2, "Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges," to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the prior year charge. 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative (G A) expenses were   $3.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , which was   $0.5 million  , or   14.9%  , lower than the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of   2015  , is due primarily to lower expenses for labor and benefits (  $0.4 million  ), insurance costs (  $0.2 million  ), and stock compensation expense ($0.1 million), partially offset by higher legal and other professional fees ($0.2 million). 
  Interest Expense, Net 
  Interest expense, net is derived from the following components:` 

Interest expense, net was   $8.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $9.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is principally attributable to a decrease in the effective interest rate

     Table of Contents  

on the long-term obligation to related party due to revisions in the mine plan at   December 31, 2015  , partially offset by the increase in the average principal balance of the long-term obligation to related party from the completion of the reserve transfer to Thoroughbred in June 2016, which increased the principal balance on the obligation by   $16.4 million  .  
  Other, Net 
  Other, net for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was a charge of   $0.9 million  , as compared to income of   $0.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease is primarily due to costs incurred associated with evaluating strategic alternatives of $0.6 million and the $0.3 million loss on the partial disposal of the Company's investment in Thoroughbred, as discussed in Note 7, "Related Party Transactions," to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.   
  Net Loss 
  Net loss for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $9.7 million  , as compared to net loss of   $145.8 million   for the same period of   2015  . The variance is primarily driven by the asset impairment and restructuring charges of $138.7 million recognized in the prior year quarter.  Excluding the impact of the prior year asset impairment and restructuring charges, the net loss increased $2.6 million due to a decline in gross margin year-over-year, partially offset by lower DD A and G A expenses during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   
  Adjusted EBITDA 
  The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure: 

Our Adjusted EBITDA for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $9.8 million   and   $16.1 million  , respectively.  The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA resulted primarily from a decline in gross margin of   $6.3 million   resulting from lower sales volume and average pricing in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of 2015, partially offset by lower G A expenses, exclusive of stock compensation expense, experienced in the current quarter.

This decrease is primarily attributable to an unfavorable volume variance of approximately   $73.9 million   year-over-year due to a continued decline in customer demand resulting in lower contracted amounts in the current year and an unfavorable price variance of approximately   $18.6 million   due to the renewal of sales contracts at less favorable prices, as well as unfavorable transportation adjustments included as a component of the price in certain of our long-term coal supply agreements as a result of declining diesel prices, as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Cost of Coal Sales 
  Cost of coal sales decreased   28.9%   to   $155.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $218.8 million   in the same period of   2015  . The decline is primarily attributable to selling   1.6 million   tons less and a reduction in the operating cost per ton during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of   2015  . On a per ton basis, our cost of coal sales decreased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period of   2015  , from   $36.87   per ton to   $35.70   per ton. This decrease in the per ton amounts is primarily due to the closure of our Lewis Creek underground mine in the first quarter of 2015, as this was a high cost operation due to the poor geological conditions of the mine, lower repair and maintenance costs at our underground mines, lower diesel fuel costs, and lower blasting costs at our surface operations due to a higher amount of unconsolidated overburden. 
  Production Royalty to Related Party 
  Production royalty to related party declined   $0.8 million  , or   13.7%  , to   $5.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of   2015  . This amount relates to production royalties earned by our affiliate, Thoroughbred, from sales originating from our Kronos underground mine (where the mineral reserves are leased directly from Thoroughbred). The reduction is primarily due to sales volume declines experienced at our Kronos underground mine during the current year, partially offset by higher average sales prices in the current year due to customer mix.   
  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 
  DD A expense decreased by   $15.5 million  , or   40.4%  , to   $22.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of   2015  . The decrease is primarily due to the accelerated depreciation in the prior year of the capitalized mine development costs associated with the Lewis Creek underground mine resulting from the closure of the mine in the first quarter of 2015, a reduction in depletion in the current year as a result of lower production levels, and a reduction in the asset base due to the impairment charge recognized in the third quarter of 2015. 
  Asset Retirement Obligation Expenses 
  Asset retirement obligation expenses decreased by   $1.3 million  , or   56.5%  , to   $1.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of   2015  . The decrease is primarily attributable to changes in asset retirement cost estimates based on revisions to discount rates, reserve valuations and projected mine lives.

Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we recognized asset impairment and restructuring charges of   $3.4 million   and   $138.7 million  , respectively.  The current year charge related to certain advance royalties that could no longer be recouped.  The prior year charge was primarily associated with the write-down of the carrying value of our long-lived assets to their estimated fair value.  See Note 2, "Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges," to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.   
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  G A expenses were   $9.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which was   $3.0 million  , or   24.1%  , lower than the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of   2015  , is due primarily to lower expenses for legal and professional services (  $0.7 million  ),  labor and benefits (  $1.1 million  ), non-income related taxes (  $0.3 million  ) and insurance costs (  $0.6 million  ). 
  Interest Expense, Net 
  Interest expense, net is derived from the following components: 

Interest expense, net was   $25.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $26.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is principally attributable to a decrease in the effective interest rate on the long-term obligation to related party due to revisions in the mine plan at   December 31, 2015  , partially offset by the increase in the average principal balance of the long-term obligation to related party from the completion of the reserve transfers to Thoroughbred in May 2015 and June 2016, which increased the principal balance on the obligation by   $18.2 million   and   $16.4 million  , respectively.  In addition, partially offsetting the decline in interest expense is the recognition of a lesser amount of capitalized interest and an increase in interest expense associated with other long-term debt due to an increase in the average outstanding obligation in the current year, as compared to the same period of   2015  .  
  Other, Net 
  Other, net for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was a charge of   $1.0 million  , as compared to income of   $4.8 million   for the same period of 2015.  The decrease is primarily due to a   $4.5 million   refund during the second quarter of 2015 for a portion of Kentucky sales and use taxes paid on the purchase of certain energy and energy producing fuels for the period of 2008 through 2013.  In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized costs associated with evaluating strategic alternatives of $1.1 million and incurred a loss on the partial disposal of our equity investment in Thoroughbred of $0.3 million.   
  Net Loss 
  Net loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $38.2 million  , as compared to a net loss of   $160.1 million   for the same period of   2015  . The variance is driven primarily by the asset impairment and restructuring charge of $138.7 million taken in the prior year.  Excluding the impact of the prior year asset impairment and restructuring charge, net loss increased by $16.7 million.  The variance is driven by a decline in gross margin in the current year,  the impairment charge recognized in the second quarter of 2016, and the refund in the second quarter of 2015 of certain previously paid Kentucky sales and use taxes, partially offset by lower DD A and G A expenses in the current year.

Adjusted EBITDA 
  The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure: 

Our Adjusted EBITDA for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $21.3 million  , as compared to   $52.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA resulted primarily from a decline in gross margin of   $29.4 million   resulting from lower sales volume and average pricing in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period of   2015   and the refund in the second quarter of 2015 of certain previously paid Kentucky sales and use taxes.  Such reduction was partially offset by lower G A expenses, exclusive of stock compensation expense, experienced in the current year.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity 
  Our business is capital intensive and requires substantial capital expenditures for purchasing, upgrading and maintaining equipment used in mining our reserves, as well as complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our principal liquidity requirements are to finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions from time to time, reclamation obligations, and to service our debt. Historically, our primary sources of liquidity to meet these needs have been cash generated by our operations, and to a lesser extent, borrowings under our credit facilities and contributions from our equity holders. 
  On December 21, 2012, we completed a   $200.0 million   offering of   11.75%   senior secured notes due 2019 (the Notes) and received proceeds of $193.1 million, as the Notes were issued at an original issue discount of   96.567%  . Interest on the Notes is due semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. In connection with the offering, we prepaid and terminated our then existing senior secured credit facility. In addition, we entered into a new asset-based revolving credit facility, which provides for revolving borrowings of up to   $50.0 million   (the 2012 Credit Facility). 
  The principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash on hand and availability under the 2012 Credit Facility.  The 2012 Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, and a failure to comply with the financial covenants could adversely impact the Company's available liquidity.  Upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event, at any time when borrowings are outstanding under the facility, we will be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, calculated as of the end of each calendar month for the 12 months then ended, greater than   1.0  -to-1.0. A Liquidity Event is defined as the occurrence of (i) an Event of Default, as such term is defined in the 2012 Credit Agreement, or (ii) undrawn availability being less than the greater of (a) $10.0 million or (b) an amount equal to 20% of the borrowing base.  As of September 30, 2016, our fixed charge coverage ratio was less than 1.0-to-1.0, which, therefore, would require us to maintain minimum availability of $10.0 million if any amounts were drawn on the 2012 Credit Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the 2012 Credit Facility and, therefore, we were not subject to the requirements of the financial covenants included within the agreement. The calculated available borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility totaled   $14.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , but due to the restrictions imposed as a result of not maintaining the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, our borrowing availability has been reduced by $10.0 million to   $4.4 million  .  As a result of the decline in availability, on November 4, 2016, we provided notification to the administrative agent of our intent to terminate the 2012 Credit Facility effective November 14, 2016.  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , our total available liquidity was   $67.1 million  , comprised of cash on hand of   $62.7 million   and   $4.4 million   available under the 2012 Credit Facility.  As of December 31, 2015, our available liquidity was $84.3 million.   
  As a result of the weak market conditions and depressed coal prices, we have undertaken steps to adequately preserve our liquidity and manage operating costs, including efficiently controlling capital expenditures. During 2015, we began initiatives to enhance our financial flexibility and reduce cash outflows in the near term, including a streamlining of our cost structure and reductions in production volumes and capital expenditures.  In addition, we have engaged financial and legal advisers to assist in the analysis of  various strategic alternatives.  Based on our current assumptions, we believe that existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and debt service requirements in 2016.  If market conditions do not improve, we expect to continue to experience operating losses, which would adversely affect our liquidity in the future.  As a result, we could be forced to take further action, including additional restructurings and reduction in capital expenditures.  
  In addition to the above, our ability to access the capital markets on acceptable economic terms in the future will be affected by general economic conditions, the domestic and global financial markets, our operational and financial performance, prevailing commodity prices and other macroeconomic factors outside of our control. Failure to obtain financing or to generate sufficient cash flow from operations could cause us to significantly reduce our spending and to alter our business plan. We may also be required to consider other options. 
  We manage our exposure to changing commodity prices for our long-term coal contract portfolio through the use of multi-year coal supply agreements. We generally enter into fixed price, fixed volume supply contracts with terms greater than one year with customers with whom we have historically had limited collection issues. Our ability to satisfy debt service obligations, fund planned capital expenditures, and make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table reflects cash flows for the applicable periods: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $4.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $31.0 million   from net cash provided by operating activities of   $35.9 million   for the same period of   2015  .  Operating results were negatively impacted during the first nine months of 2016 due to a decline in gross margin resulting primarily from lower shipments and average pricing during this period, as compared to the same period of 2015. Offsetting this decline is a reduction in DD A and G A expenses.  Positively impacting cash flows from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was an increase in the net related party liabilities of   $10.3 million   due to the deferment of amounts owed to our affiliate, Thoroughbred, including interest and royalties earned on leased reserves, and a decrease in inventory due to the timing of shipments. Negatively impacting operating cash flows was a decrease in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities due to the timing of payments. Cash flows from operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were positively impacted by the receipt of a Kentucky sales and use tax refund totaling $4.5 million during the second quarter of 2015, an increase in net related party liabilities of   $13.1 million   due to the deferment of amounts owed to Thoroughbred, including royalties earned on leased reserves.  Negatively impacting operating cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was an increase in inventory due to the timing of shipments and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities due to the timing of payments.  
  Net cash used in investing activities decreased   $14.8 million   to   $1.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $16.4 million   for the same period of   2015  . The current year investment is primarily attributable to capital expenditures to maintain our existing fixed assets, partially offset by the receipt of cash of   $500   for the partial disposal of our

     Table of Contents  

equity investment in Thoroughbred, as Yorktown exercised its right under the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Thoroughbred Resources, LP to remove Elk Creek, GP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Armstrong Energy, as the general partner of Thoroughbred, effective September 1, 2016.  See Note 7 "Related Party Transactions" to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  The prior year investment is largely attributable to capital expenditures for equipment and mine development associated with our new Survant underground mine.  
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $8.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to net cash used in financing activities of   $6.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The current year and prior year activity relates primarily to scheduled capital lease and other long-term debt payments. 
  Contractual Obligations 
  Our contractual obligations have not changed materially from the disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 23, 2016. 
  Capital Expenditures 
  Our mining operations require investments to expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations and to comply with environmental and safety regulations. In response to the challenging coal environment, we have sought to maintain a controlled, disciplined approach to capital spending in order to preserve liquidity.  Our anticipated total capital expenditures for 2016 are estimated to be within a range of   $3.5 million   to   $5.0 million  , a decrease of approximately 75% to 85% compared to 2015. Management anticipates funding capital requirements with current cash balances and cash flows provided by operations. With respect to any significant development projects, we plan to defer them to time periods beyond 2016 and will continue to evaluate the timing associated with those projects based on changes in overall coal supply and demand. 
  Mine Development Costs 
  Mine development costs are capitalized until production commences, other than production incidental to the mine development process, and are amortized on a units-of-production method based on the estimated proven and probable reserves. Mine development costs represent costs incurred in establishing access to mineral reserves and include costs associated with sinking or driving shafts and underground drifts, permanent excavations, roads and tunnels. The end of the development phase and the beginning of the production phase takes place when construction of the mine for economic extraction is substantially complete. Our estimate of when construction of the mine for economic extraction is substantially complete is based upon a number of assumptions, such as expectations regarding the economic recoverability of reserves, the type of mine under development, and the completion of certain mine requirements, such as ventilation. Coal extracted during the development phase is incidental to the mine s production capacity and is not considered to be a triggering event to shift the mine into the production phase. 
  During the third quarter of 2015, we completed development of an additional underground mine at our Parkway complex, Survant, to extract coal from the West Kentucky #8 seam.  Annual production capacity at the mine is eventually expected to be expanded to approximately   2.4 million   tons. Capitalized development costs for the new mine totaled approximately   $25.2 million  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as surety bonds. No liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. 
  Federal and state laws require us to secure certain long-term obligations such as mine closure and reclamation costs and other obligations. We typically secure these obligations by using surety bonds, an off-balance sheet instrument. The use of surety bonds is less expensive for us than the alternative of posting a 100% cash bond. To the extent that surety bonds become unavailable, we would seek to secure our reclamation obligations with letters of credit, cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $32.5 million   in surety bonds outstanding to secure the performance of     our reclamation obligations, which were supported by approximately   $6.0 million   of cash posted as collateral.

Related Party Transactions 
  In the normal course of business, we engage in certain related party transactions with Thoroughbred, as well as other affiliated parties. These transactions generally include production and overriding royalties, administrative service agreements, reserve leases, and certain financing arrangements. For more information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 7,  Related Party Transactions,  to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report and  Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 23, 2016. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 
  The most significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to units-of-production amortization calculations, asset retirement obligations, useful lives for depreciation of fixed assets, impairment of long-lived assets, and the accounting for the long-term obligation to related party. For a full discussion of our accounting estimates and assumptions that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 23, 2016. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  See Note 1, "Description of Business and Entity Structure," to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of newly adopted accounting standards and accounting standards not yet implemented. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  We define market risk as the risk of economic loss as a consequence of the adverse movement of market rates and prices. We believe our principal market risks are commodity price risk and credit risk. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We sell most of the coal we produce under multi-year coal supply agreements. Historically, we have principally managed the commodity price risks from our coal sales by entering into multi-year coal supply agreements of varying terms and durations, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. 
  Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel, explosives and steel products for roof support used in our underground mining, are subject to price volatility. Through our suppliers, we utilize forward purchases to manage a portion of our exposure related to diesel fuel volatility. A hypothetical increase of $0.10 per gallon for diesel fuel would have negatively impacted our results of operations by   $0 million   and   $0.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. A hypothetical increase of 10% in steel prices would have negatively impacted our results of operations by   $0.3 million   and   $0.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. A hypothetical increase of 10% in explosives prices would have negatively impacted our results of operations by   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  Credit Risk 
  Most of our coal sales are made to electric utilities. Therefore, our credit risk is primarily with domestic electric power generators. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customer s creditworthiness prior to entering into a transaction with the customer and to constantly monitor outstanding accounts receivable against established credit limits. When deemed appropriate, we will take steps to reduce credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit has deteriorated. Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements and have historically been minimal.

  CERTIFICATION 
  I, Martin D. Wilson, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Armstrong Energy, Inc.; 
              2.

Exhibit 95.1  
  Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Safety Data  
  Armstrong Energy, Inc. s mining operations are subject to regulations issued by MSHA under the U.S. Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it also generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, related to the alleged violation. Citations or orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments varies depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine, among other factors.  
  The following disclosures have been provided pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act).  
  Mine Safety Data  . The following provides additional information about references used in the table below to describe the categories of violations, orders or citations issued by MSHA under the Mine Act:  
              
    Section 104 S S Citations:   Citations issued by MSHA under Section 104(a) of the Mine Act for violations of health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to a serious injury if left unabated.  
                 
    Section 104(b) Orders:   Orders issued under Section 104(b) of the Mine Act, which represent a failure to abate a citation under Section 104(a) within the period prescribed by MSHA. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated.  
                
    Section 104(d) Citations and Orders:   Citations and orders issued by MSHA under Section 104(d) of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety standards. These types of violations could significantly and substantially contribute to a serious injury; however, the conditions do not cause imminent danger (refer to discussion of imminent danger orders below).  
                 
    Section 104(e) Notices:   Notices issued by MSHA under Section 104(e) of the Mine Act for an alleged pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to mine health or safety hazards.  
                 
    Section 110(b)(2) Violations:   Flagrant violations identified by MSHA under Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. The term flagrant with respect to a violation is defined as  a reckless or repeated failure to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health or safety standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury.   
                 
    Section 107(a) Orders:   Orders issued by MSHA under Section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an imminent danger existed. Orders issued under Section 107(a) of the Mine Act require the operator of the mine to cause all persons (except authorized persons) to be withdrawn from the mine until the imminent danger and the conditions that caused such imminent danger cease to exist.  

The following table details the violations, citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , not taking into account any changes to the severity or amount of such citations or orders after assessment:  

(1)    
    The table does not include the following: (i) facilities which have been idled or closed unless they received a citation or order issued by MSHA; and (ii) permitted mining sites where we have not begun operations and therefore have not received any citations.  
     Pending Legal Actions  .   The table below provides a summary of legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) as of   September 30, 2016  , as well as the aggregate number of legal actions instituted and resolved during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  Each legal action is assigned a docket number by the Commission and may have as its subject matter one or more citations, orders, penalties or complaints.  The Commission is an independent adjudicative agency established by the Mine Act that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act. These cases may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and penalties they have received from MSHA, or complaints of discrimination by miners under Section 105 of the Mine Act.  

The following provides additional information of the types of proceedings that may be brought before the Commission:  
             
    Contest Proceedings     A contest proceeding may be filed by an operator to challenge the issuance of a citation or order issued by MSHA.  
                 
    Civil Penalty Proceedings     A civil penalty proceeding may be filed by an operator to challenge a civil penalty MSHA has proposed for a violation contained in a citation or order. The validity of the citation may be challenged in this proceeding, as well.  
                 
    Discrimination Proceedings     Involves a miner s allegation that he or she has suffered adverse employment action because he or she engaged in activity protected under the Mine Act, such as making a safety complaint. Also includes temporary reinstatement proceedings involving cases in which a miner has filed a complaint with MSHA stating that he or she has suffered discrimination and the miner has lost his or her position.  
                 
    Compensation Proceedings     A compensation proceeding may be filed by miners entitled to compensation when a mine is closed by certain closure orders issued by MSHA. The purpose of the proceeding is to determine the amount of compensation, if any, due to miners idled by the orders.  
                 
    Temporary Relief     Applications for temporary relief are applications filed under section 105(b)(2) of the Mine Act for temporary relief from any modification or termination of any order.  
                 
    Appeals     An appeal may be filed by an operator to challenge judges  decisions or orders to the Commission, including petitions for discretionary review and review by the Commission on its own motion.
