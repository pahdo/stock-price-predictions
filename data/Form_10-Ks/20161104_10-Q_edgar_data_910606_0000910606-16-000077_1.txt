EXPLANATORY NOTE 
  This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of Regency Centers Corporation and Regency Centers, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to  Regency Centers Corporation  or the  Parent Company  mean Regency Centers Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries; and references to  Regency Centers, L.P.  or the  Operating Partnership  mean Regency Centers, L.P. and its controlled subsidiaries.  The term  the Company  or  Regency  means the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, collectively. 
  The Parent Company is a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) and the general partner of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units ( Units ).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Parent Company owned approximately   99.9%   of the Units in the Operating Partnership and the remaining limited Units are owned by investors.  The Parent Company owns all of the Series 6 and 7 Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.   
  The Company believes combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits: 

Enhances investors' understanding of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;   

Eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation; and   

Creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.  
     Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one business.  The management of the Parent Company consists of the same individuals as the management of the Operating Partnership.  These individuals are officers of the Parent Company and employees of the Operating Partnership. 
  The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company.  The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership.  As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership.  The Parent Company does not hold any indebtedness, but guarantees all of the unsecured public debt of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership holds all the assets of the Company and retains the ownership interests in the Company's joint ventures.  Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company's business.  These sources include the Operating Partnership's operations, its direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness, and the issuance of partnership units. 
  Stockholders' equity, partners' capital, and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and those of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units, and Series 6 and 7 Preferred Units owned by the Parent Company.  The limited partners' units in the Operating Partnership owned by third parties are accounted for in partners' capital in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and outside of stockholders' equity in noncontrolling interests in the Parent Company's financial statements.  The Series 6 and 7 Preferred Units owned by the Parent Company are eliminated in consolidation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and are classified as preferred units of general partner in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership. 
  In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, there are sections in this report that separately discuss the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, including separate financial statements, controls and procedures sections, and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications.  In the sections that combine disclosure for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company.  
    
  As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.  Therefore, while stockholders' equity and partners' capital differ as discussed above, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.

1. 
    Organization and Principles of Consolidation 
     General 
  Regency Centers Corporation (the  Parent Company ) began its operations as a Real Estate Investment Trust ( REIT ) in   1993   and is the general partner of Regency Centers, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ).  The Parent Company engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, and development of retail shopping centers through the Operating Partnership, and has no other assets or liabilities other than through its investment in the Operating Partnership.  The Parent Company currently owns approximately   99.9%   of the outstanding common Partnership Units of the Operating Partnership.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the "Company  or  Regency ) owned   197   retail shopping centers and held partial interests in an additional   110   retail shopping centers through unconsolidated investments in real estate partnerships (also referred to as "joint ventures" or "investment partnerships"). 
    
  The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.  These adjustments are considered to be of a normal recurring nature.   
    
  Consolidation 
  The Company consolidates properties that are wholly owned or properties where it owns less than 100%, but which it controls. Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of voting interest entities and variable interest entities ("VIEs").  For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the entity where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company's determination of the primary beneficiary considers all relationships between it and the VIE, including management agreements and other contractual arrangements. 
  Ownership of the Operating Partnership 
  The Operating Partnership s capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Parent Company owned approximately   99.9%   of the outstanding common Partnership Units of the Operating Partnership with the remaining limited Partnership Units held by third parties ( Exchangeable operating partnership units  or  EOP units ).  The Parent Company serves as general partner of the Operating Partnership.  The EOP unit holders have limited rights over the Operating Partnership such that they do not have characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  As such, the Operating Partnership is considered a variable interest entity, and the Parent Company is the primary beneficiary which consolidates it.  The Parent Company s only investment is the Operating Partnership.  
  Real Estate Partnerships 
  Regency has an ownership interest in   121   properties through partnerships, of which   11   are consolidated, with institutional investors, other real estate developers and/or operators, and individual parties who help Regency source transactions for development and investment ("the Partners", "limited partners").  Regency has a variable interest in these entities through its equity interests.  As managing member, Regency maintains the books and records and typically provides leasing and property management to the partnerships.  The partners  level of involvement varies from protective decisions (debt, bankruptcy, selling primary asset(s) of business) to involvement in approving leases, operating budgets, and capital budgets.   
             
    Those partnerships for which the partners only have protective rights are considered VIEs under ASC 810, Consolidation.  Regency is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as Regency has power over these partnerships and they operate primarily for the benefit of Regency.  As such, Regency consolidates these entities and reports the limited partners  interest as noncontrolling interests.

REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  September 30, 2016 

The majority of the operations of the VIEs are funded with cash flows generated by the properties, or in the case of developments, with capital contributions or third party construction loans.  Regency does not provide financial support to the VIEs.  
             
    Those partnerships for which the partners are involved in the day to day decisions and do not have any other aspects that would cause them to be considered VIEs, are evaluated for consolidation using the voting interest model.  

Those partnerships in which Regency has a controlling financial interest are consolidated and the limited partners  ownership interest and share of net income is recorded as noncontrolling interest.   

Those partnerships in which Regency does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for using the equity method and its ownership interest is recognized through single-line presentation as Investments in Real Estate Partnerships, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and Equity in Income of Investments in Real Estate Partnerships, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Distributions received from these partnerships are accounted for using the look-through method with returns of capital from property sales or debt financing considered investing cash flows and the remaining distributions generally considered operating cash flows.    
       
  The assets of these partnerships are restricted to the use of the partnerships and cannot be used by general creditors of the Company.  And similarly, the obligations of these partnerships can only be settled by the assets of these partnerships.   
  The major classes of assets, liabilities, and non-controlling equity interests held by the Company's VIEs are as follows: 

Reclassifications 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company reclassified its land held for future development from Properties in development to Land within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company reclassified prior period amounts of   $47.3 million   to conform to current period presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements and expected impact on our financial statements: 
                           Standard 
      
    Description 
      
    Date of adoption 
      
    Effect on the financial statements or other significant matters 
      Recently adopted: 

ASU 2015-02,     February 2015  , Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis    
      
    ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs.  
      
    January 2016 
      
    The adoption of this standard resulted in five additional investment partnerships being considered variable interest entities due to the limited partners' lack of substantive participation in the partnerships.  This did not result in any impact to the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, or Cash Flows, but did result in additional disclosures about its relationships with and exposure to variable interest entities.  

ASU 2015-03, April 2015,   Interest - Imputation of Interest   (Subtopic 835-30):   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   
      
    ASU 2015-03 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. 

January 2016 
      
    The adoption and implementation of this standard has resulted in the retrospective presentation of debt issuance costs associated with the Company's notes payable and term loans as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt instruments (previously, included in deferred costs in the consolidated balance sheets). 
  Unamortized debt issuance costs of $8.2 million has been reclassified to offset the related debt as of December 31, 2015. 

ASU 2015-15, August 2015,    Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements 
      
    ASU 2015-15 clarifies that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements may be deferred and presented as an asset, amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings. 

January 2016 
      
    The adoption of this standard resulted in debt issuance costs related to the Line of credit ("Line") to continue being presented as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, previously within deferred costs, and now presented within other assets.

Standard 
      
    Description 
      
    Date of adoption 
      
    Effect on the financial statements or other significant matters 
      Not yet adopted: 

ASU 2014-15,  August 2014,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
      
    The standard requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide certain disclosures when it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. 
      
    December 2016 
      
    The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, or Cash Flows but will result in more disclosure surrounding the Company's plans for addressing significant upcoming debt maturities. 

ASU 2016-09, March 2016,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718):     Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
      
    This ASU affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The ASU is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize stock compensation forfeitures as they occur, and changes to classification on the statement of cash flows. 
      
    January 2017 
      
    The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): 
    
  ASU 2014-09, May 2014,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 
    
  ASU 2016-08, March 2016,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations  
    
  ASU 2016-10, April 2016,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing 
    
  ASU 2016-12, May 2016,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients 

The standard will replace existing revenue recognition standards and significantly expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. It may be adopted either retrospectively or on a modified retrospective basis to new contracts and existing contracts with remaining performance obligations as of the effective date. 

January 2018 
      
    The Company is currently evaluating the alternative methods of adoption and the impact it may have on its financial statements and related disclosures.

Standard 
      
    Description 
      
    Date of adoption 
      
    Effect on the financial statements or other significant matters 
      ASU 2016-01, January 2016,   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
      
    The standard amends the guidance to classify equity securities with readily-determinable fair values into different categories and requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method are not included in the scope of this amendment. Early adoption of this amendment is not permitted. 

January 2018 
      
    The Company does not expect the adoption and implementation of this standard to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial     condition or cash flows. 

ASU 2016-15, August 2016,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
      
    The standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. Early adoption is permitted on a retrospective basis.  
      
    January 2018 
      
    The ASU is consistent with the Company's current treatment and the Company does not expect the adoption and implementation of this standard to have an impact on its cash flow statement. 

ASU 2016-02, February 2016,   Leases (Topic 842)  
      
    The standard amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets.  It also makes targeted changes to lessor accounting, including a change to the treatment of initial direct leasing costs, which no longer considers fixed internal leasing salaries as capitalizable costs.   
    
  Early adoption of this standard is permitted to coincide with adoption of ASU 2014-09. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. 
      
    January 2019 
      
    The Company is currently evaluating the alternative methods of adoption and the impact it will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

ASU 2016-13, June 2016  , Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
      
    The amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.

4.    Notes Payable and Unsecured Credit Facilities 
  The Company s outstanding debt consisted of the following:    

(1)     As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount consists of two mortgages with variable interest rates of   one month LIBOR plus 150 basis points   and which mature on   October 16, 2020   and   April 1, 2023  , respectively.  Interest rate swaps are in place fixing the interest rates at   3.696%   on   $28.1 million   and   2.803%   on   $20.0 million  , respectively.  See note 5.  
    
  As of    September 30, 2016   , the key interest rates of the Company's notes payables and credit facilities were as follows: 

(1)    Weighted average effective and contractual rate for the Line is calculated based on a fully drawn Line balance.  
  Significant financing activity since   December 31, 2015   includes the following: 
             
    The Company has repaid   three   mortgages totaling   $41.6 million   that were scheduled to mature during   2016  . 
                
    The Company issued new variable rate mortgage debt of   $20.0 million  , related to one of the mortgages that matured during   2016  , and fixed the rate at   2.803%   with an interest rate swap. 
                
    The Company amended its existing Term Loan, which increased the facility size by   $100.0 million   to   $265.0 million  , extended the maturity date to   January 5, 2022   and reduced the applicable interest rate. The Term Loan now bears interest at   LIBOR plus a ratings based margin of 0.95%   per annum, subject to adjustment from time to time based on changes to the Company's corporate credit rating.  At closing, the Company executed interest rate swaps for the full notional amount of the Term Loan, which fixed the interest rate at   2.0%   through maturity.     
                
    In August, the Company redeemed the entirety of its   $300 million   of   5.875%   senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2017 ("  $300 million   notes") funded from proceeds from an equity offering, as discussed in note 7.  The redemption payment included a   $13.2 million   make-whole premium that was expensed during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .

As of   September 30, 2016  , scheduled principal payments and maturities on notes payable were as follows:    

(1)    Includes unsecured public debt and unsecured credit facilities. 

The Company was in compliance as of   September 30, 2016   with the financial and other covenants under its unsecured public debt and unsecured credit facilities.   

5.    Derivative Financial Instruments 
  The following table summarizes the terms and fair values of the Company's derivative financial instruments, as well as their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:    

(1)     Represents the date specified in the agreement for either optional or mandatory early termination by the counterparty, which will result in cash settlement.  The Company has the option to terminate and settle at any date prior to this.   
   (2)      Derivatives in an asset position are included within Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, while those in a liability position are included within Accounts payable and other liabilities. 
   (3)     In 2014, the Company entered into   $220 million   of forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate on new fixed rate ten year debt that the Company expected to issue in June 2017 for the specific purpose of repaying at maturity the   $300 million   notes.  These interest rate swaps locked in a weighted average fixed rate of   3.48%  , before the Company's credit spread.  These swaps were settled during the during the third quarter of 2016, as further described below.   
  These derivative financial instruments are all interest rate swaps, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and, as of   September 30, 2016  , does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.  The Company has master netting agreements;  
  
   21 

REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  September 30, 2016 

however, the Company does not have multiple derivatives subject to a single master netting agreement with the same counterparties.  Therefore, none are offset in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings within Interest expense, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
    
  The following table represents the effect of the derivative financial instruments on the accompanying consolidated financial statements: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company expects   $10.7 million   of net deferred losses on derivative instruments accumulated in Other comprehensive income, including the Company's share from its Investments in real estate partnerships, to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months.  Included in the reclass is   $8.4 million   which is related to previously settled swaps on the Company's ten year fixed rate unsecured loans.   
  Hedge Settlement  
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company initiated and completed a   $400.1 million   equity offering, as further described in note 7, for the primary purpose of funding the early redemption of its   $300 million   notes.  The Company also used   $40.6 million   from the net offering proceeds to settle   $220 million   of forward starting swaps related to new debt previously expected to be issued in 2017 to repay the notes at maturity.  As a result of the equity offering, the Company believed that the issuance of new fixed rate debt within the remaining period of the forward starting swaps was probable not to occur.  Accordingly, the Company ceased hedge accounting and reclassified the   $40.6 million   paid to settle the forward starting swaps from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings during the third quarter of 2016.

6.    Fair Value Measurements 
    
  (a)  Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  All financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts which, in management's estimation, reasonably approximate their fair values, except for the following: 

The above fair values represent management's estimate of the amounts that would be received from selling those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  These fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs.  However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.   
    
  The Company develops its judgments based on the best information available at the measurement date, including expected cash flows, appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates, and available observable and unobservable inputs.  Service providers involved in fair value measurements are evaluated for competency and qualifications on an ongoing basis.  As considerable judgment is often necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments, the fair values presented above are not necessarily indicative of amounts that will be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments. 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments: 
    
  Notes Receivable 
    
  The fair value of the Company's Notes receivable is estimated by calculating the present value of future contractual cash flows discounted at interest rates available for notes of the same terms and maturities, adjusted for counter-party specific credit risk.  The fair value of Notes receivable was determined primarily using Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy, which considered counter-party credit risk and collateral risk of the underlying property securing the note receivable.   
    
  Notes Payable 
    
  The fair value of the Company's unsecured debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities.  The fair value of the unsecured debt was determined using Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  
    
  The fair value of the Company's mortgage notes payable is estimated by discounting future cash flows of each instrument at rates that reflect the current market rates available to the Company for debt of the same terms and maturities.   Fixed rate loans assumed in connection with real estate acquisitions are recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at fair value at the time the property is acquired.  The fair value of the mortgage notes payable was determined using Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  
    
  Unsecured Credit Facilities 
    
  The fair value of the Company's Unsecured credit facilities is estimated based on the interest rates currently offered to the Company by financial institutions.  The fair value of the credit facilities was determined using Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.   

23 

REGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  September 30, 2016 

The following interest rate ranges were used by the Company to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments: 

(b)  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 
    
  Trading Securities Held in Trust 
    
  The Company has investments in marketable securities, which are assets of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan ("NQDCP"), that are classified as trading securities held in trust on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of the Trading securities held in trust was determined using quoted prices in active markets, which are considered Level 1 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Changes in the value of trading securities are recorded within net investment (income) loss from deferred compensation plan in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.   
    
  Available-for-Sale Securities 
    
  Available-for-sale securities consist of investments in certificates of deposit and corporate bonds, and are recorded at fair value using matrix pricing methods to estimate fair value, which are considered Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Unrealized gains or losses on these securities are recognized through Other comprehensive income. 
    
  Interest Rate Derivatives 
  The fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.   
  Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.  The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate swaps.  As a result, the Company determined that its interest rate swaps valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

11.    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The Company is involved in litigation on a number of matters and is subject to certain claims, which arise in the normal course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  Legal fees are expensed as incurred.   
    
  The Company is also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to real estate pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks.  The Company believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on its financial position, liquidity, or operations.  The Company can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to the shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities, that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to it, that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties, or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to the Company. 
    
  The Company has the right to issue letters of credit under the Line up to an amount not to exceed   $50.0 million  , which reduces the credit availability under the Line. These letters of credit are primarily issued as collateral on behalf of its captive insurance program and to facilitate the construction of development projects.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $5.8 million   and   $5.9 million  , respectively, in letters of credit outstanding.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements       
    
     In addition to historical information, the following information contains forward-looking statements as defined under federal securities laws.  These forward-looking statements include statements about anticipated changes in our revenues, the size of our development and redevelopment program, earnings per share and unit, returns and portfolio value, and expectations about our liquidity.  These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the real estate industry and markets in which the Company operates, and management's beliefs and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.  Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in national and local economic conditions, financial difficulties of tenants, competitive market conditions, including timing and pricing of acquisitions and sales of properties and building pads ("out-parcels"), changes in leasing activity and market rents, timing of development starts, meeting development schedules, natural disasters in geographic areas in which we operate, cost of environmental remediation, our inability to exercise voting control over the co-investment partnerships through which we own many of our properties, and technology disruptions.  For additional information, see  Risk Factors  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto of Regency Centers Corporation and Regency Centers, L.P. appearing elsewhere herein.  We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or uncertainties after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of uncertain events. 

Defined Terms 
    
  We use certain non-GAAP performance measures, in addition to the required GAAP presentations, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the Company's operational results.  We manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure, although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval.  Therefore, we believe presenting our pro-rata share of certain operating metrics regardless of ownership structure, along with other non-GAAP  measures, makes comparisons of other REITs' operating results to the Company's more meaningful. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change. 
    
  The following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results:   

Same Property   information is provided for operating properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both calendar year periods being compared and excludes Non-Same Properties and Properties in Development.  

A Non-Same Property   is a property acquired, sold, or a development completion during either calendar year period being compared.  Corporate activities, including the captive insurance company, are part of Non-Same Property.   

Property In Development   is a property owned and intended to be developed, including partially operating properties acquired specifically for redevelopment and excluding land held for future development. 

Development Completion   is a project in development that is deemed complete upon the earliest of: (i) 90% of total estimated net development costs have been incurred and percent leased equals or exceeds 95%, or (ii) the project features at least two years of anchor operations, or (iii) three years have passed since the start of construction. Once deemed complete, the property is termed an Operating Property. 

Pro-Rata   information includes 100% of our consolidated properties plus our ownership interest in our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.   
       
  The pro-rata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio.  We do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships, and the pro-rata presentations of the assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items.  The partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements, which provide for such allocations according to their invested capital.  Our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our pro-rata share.   
  
   31 

The presentation of pro-rata information has limitations which include, but are not limited to, the following: 
             
    The amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting or allocating noncontrolling interests, and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; and 

Other companies in our industry may calculate their pro-rata interest differently, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. 
       
  Because of these limitations, the pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP.  We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements, using the pro-rata information as a supplement. 
             
    Core EBITDA   is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, real estate gains and losses, and development and acquisition pursuit costs. 

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio   is defined as Core EBITDA divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders. 

Net Operating Income ("NOI")   is the sum of minimum rent, percentage rent and recoveries from tenants and other income, less operating and maintenance, real estate taxes, and provision for doubtful accounts.  NOI excludes straight-line rental income, above and below market rent amortization and other fees.  The Company also provides disclosure of NOI excluding termination fees, which excludes both termination fee income and expenses.   

NAREIT Funds from Operations ("NAREIT FFO")   is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales of depreciable property, net of tax, excluding operating real estate impairments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute NAREIT FFO for all periods presented in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Many companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. Since NAREIT FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions, and impairments, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, NAREIT FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations.   

Core FFO   is an additional performance measure used by Regency as the computation of NAREIT FFO includes certain non-cash and non-comparable items that affect the Company's period-over-period performance.  Core FFO excludes from NAREIT FFO, but is not limited to: (a) transaction related gains, income or expense; (b) impairments on land; (c) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; and (d) other non-core amounts as they occur.  The Company provides a reconciliation of NAREIT FFO to Core FFO.

Overview of Our Strategy 
    
  Regency Centers began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993, and currently owns direct or partial interests in   307   shopping centers, the majority of which are grocery-anchored community and neighborhood centers.  Our centers are located in the top markets of   25   states and the District of Columbia, and contain   37.6 million   square feet ("SF") of  gross leasable area ("GLA").  All of our operating, investing, and financing activities are performed through the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and through its investment partnerships.  The Parent Company currently owns approximately   99.9%   of the outstanding common partnership units of the Operating Partnership.  
  Our mission is to be the preeminent grocery-anchored shopping center owner and developer through: 
             
    First-rate performance of our exceptionally merchandised and located national portfolio; 
                
    Value-enhancing services of the best team of professionals in the business; and 
                
    Creation of superior growth in shareholder value. 
       
  Our strategy is: 
             
    Sustain average annual 3% NOI growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers; 
                
    Develop new, and redevelop existing, high quality shopping centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program; 
                
    Maintain our strong balance sheet to provide financial flexibility, to cost effectively fund uses of capital, and to weather economic downturns; and 
                
    Engage a talented and dedicated team with high standards of integrity that operates efficiently and is recognized as a leader in the real estate industry.  
       
  Executing on our Strategy 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we executed on our strategic objectives to further solidify Regency s position as a leader among shopping center REITs: 
  Sustain average annual 3% NOI growth from a high-quality, growing portfolio of thriving community and neighborhood shopping centers. 
  We earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to grocery stores, major retail anchors, restaurants, side-shop retailers, and service providers, as well as ground leasing or selling out-parcels to these same types of tenants.  We experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates in our existing shopping centers, by acquiring and developing new shopping centers, and by redeveloping shopping centers within our portfolio.  Noteworthy milestones and achievements during   2016   include: 
             
    We achieved pro-rata same property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, of   3.4%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
                 
    We grew rental rates 10.7% on new and renewal leases of comparable size space during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
                
    We invested in the acquisition of three operating properties, for a gross purchase price of   $333.8 million  .    
       
  Develop new, high quality shopping centers and redevelop existing centers at attractive returns on investment from a disciplined development program. 
  We capitalize on our development capabilities, market presence, and anchor relationships by investing in new developments and redevelopments of existing centers.  
             
    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we started $108.5 million of development and redevelopment projects, net of partner funding requirements, with a weighted average projected return of 8.2%. 
                
    At   September 30, 2016  , we have five ground-up developments in process, with total expected net development costs of $112.0 million, net of partner funding requirements, and have $40.0 million of net costs to complete.  These developments are projecting returns on capital of 7.9% and are currently 85.4% leased.  
     We also have 16 redevelopments of existing centers in process with total expected net redevelopment costs of $112.3 million, with $66.3 million of costs to complete, and projected incremental returns ranging from 7.0% - 10.0%. 
  
   33 

Maintain our strong balance sheet to provide financial flexibility, to cost effectively fund uses of capital, and to weather economic downturns. 
  We fund acquisitions and development activities from various capital sources including operating cash flow, property sales through a disciplined match-funding strategy of selling low growth assets, equity offerings, new debt financing, and capital from our co-investment partners.  
              
    In June 2016, we settled   1.85 million   of the 3.1 million shares of the forward equity offering resulting in net proceeds of   $137.5 million  , which was used to partially repay the Line balance.   
                 
    In July 2016, we issued 5.0 million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $400.1 million, used to (i) repay in full our   $300 million   notes, including a make-whole payment, (ii) settle the forward interest rate swaps, and (iii) fund investment activities and general corporate purposes.    

Shopping Center Portfolio 
    
  The following table summarizes general information related to the Consolidated Properties in our shopping center portfolio: 

The following table summarizes general information related to the Unconsolidated Properties owned in co-investment partnerships in our shopping center portfolio: 

During October 2016, the southeastern United States was hit hard by Hurricane Matthew as it moved very close to the coasts of Florida, Goergia, South Carolina and North Carolina.  The Company s shopping centers along the East Coast sustained only minor damage as a result of Hurricane Matthew.  Beyond power outages at a limited number of properties, the scope of damage was limited to tree and debris removal and minor roof leaks, with no major structural damage to report.

For the purpose of the following disclosures of occupancy and leasing activity, anchor space is considered space greater than or equal to 10,000 SF and shop space is less than 10,000 SF.  The following table summarizes pro-rata occupancy rates of our combined Consolidated and Unconsolidated shopping center portfolio: 

The decline in anchor percent leased is due to the Sports Authority bankruptcy and its rejection of two leases at our shopping centers.  See additional discussion below about bankruptcies.       
    
  The following table summarizes leasing activity, including Regency's pro-rata share of activity within the portfolio of our co-investment partnerships: 

(1)    Number of leasing transactions reported at 100%; all other statistics reported at pro-rata share.       
   (2)    Totals for base rent, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions reflect the weighted average PSF. 
    
  Total average base rent signed on our shop space leases of   $31.00   increased in 2016 compared to 2015 and exceeds the average annual base rent of all shop space leases due to expire during the next twelve months of $27.93 PSF, by 11.0%. 

35 

Significant Tenants and Concentrations of Risk 
    
  We seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property, market, or tenant.  The following table summarizes our four most significant tenants, based on their percentage of annualized base rent, each of which is a grocery tenant:    

Bankruptcies and Credit Concerns 
    
  Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy may have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues. We monitor the operating performance and rent collections of all tenants in our shopping centers, especially those tenants with operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition, business practice, and store closings in other locations.  However, no tenant represents more than 5% of our annual base rent on a pro-rata basis. 
    
  Our management team devotes significant time to monitoring consumer preferences, shopping behaviors, and demographics to anticipate both challenges and opportunities in the changing retail industry that may affect our tenants. As a result of our findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail the allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements within a certain retail category or to a specific retailer.  
    
  During March 2016, Sports Authority filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, at which time we had three leases in our portfolio.  One of those leases has been assumed by another retailer and the remaining two have been rejected and the stores closed.  Those two rejected leases represented $2.1 million, or 0.4%, of total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis.  We are currently working to re-tenant these spaces.     
    
  During 2016, Sears Holdings announced that it planned to accelerate the closing of a number of unprofitable stores due to continued poor sales.  Sears continues to report significant declines in operating revenues and performance, and its ability to continue operating stores in our shopping centers is uncertain.  We have five Sears or Kmart leases in our portfolio, which currently represent $3.1 million, or 0.6%, of total annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis.   None of the announced store closures, as of this filing, are within our shopping centers.  However, we are currently working to opportunistically re-tenant the spaces as the lease terms permit.

Results from Operations 
    
  Comparison of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to   2015  :

Minimum rent increased as follows:    

$1.9 million increase from rent commencing at development properties; 

$5.1 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and

  We earned fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition, and financing services that we provided to our co-investment partnerships and third parties as follows: 

37 

Changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table:    

Depreciation and amortization costs increased as follows: 
             
    $945,000 increase as we began depreciating costs at development properties where tenant spaces were completed and became available for occupancy; 
                
    $3.0 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and 
                
    $749,000 million increase from same properties, attributable to recent capital improvements and redevelopments;  
                
    reduced by $1.0 million from the sale of operating properties and other corporate asset disposals.  
       
  Operating and maintenance costs increased as follows:   
             
    $651,000 increase from operations commencing at development properties;  
                
    $1.3 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and  
                
    $2.1 million increase from same properties primarily in recoverable costs;  
           
  General and administrative expenses increased as follows: 
             
    $2.0 million increase from the change in the value of participant obligations within the deferred compensation plan; 
                
    reduced by $629,000 of higher development overhead capitalization due to the timing of project starts. 
       
  Real estate taxes increased as follows:  
             
    $252,000 increase from development properties where capitalization ceased as tenant spaces became available for occupancy; and 
                
    $1.1 million increase from acquisitions of operating properties; 
           
  Other operating expenses decreased   $834,000   primarily due to lower acquisition and pursuit costs and less tax expenses.  

38 

The following table presents the components of other expense (income):   

The   $3.2 million   decrease in total interest expense is due to: 

$3.7 million   decrease in interest on notes payable from refinancing and deleveraging activities in 2015 and the early redemption of our   $300 million   notes in August 2016; offset by, 

$492,000   increase in interest expense related to higher average balances on our unsecured credit facilities; and 

$531,000   increase due to lower interest capitalization on our development and redevelopment projects. 
       
  In connection with the early redemption of the   $300 million   notes, we recognized a $13.9 million charge, including a $13.2 million make-whole premium and $700,000 of unamortized debt issuance costs.   
    
  Net investment income increased $2.0 million driven by realized and unrealized gains of investments held by the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.  
    
  We recognized a   $40.6 million   charge to settle $220 million of forward starting interest rate swaps related to debt previously expected to be issued in 2017 to repay our $300 million notes due June 2017.  As a result of our July 2016 equity offering and the early redemption of the notes in August 2016, the Company believed that the issuance of new fixed rate debt within the remaining period of the forward starting swaps was probable to no longer occur. Accordingly, we ceased hedge accounting and reclassified the   $40.6 million   paid to settle the forward starting swaps from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. 
    
  Our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased as follows:     

The   $17.0 million   increase in our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributed to (i) an increase in our share of the gain on sales of real estate within our Other investments in real estate partnerships; (ii) interest expense savings within GRIR resulting from decreased debt balances and refinancing activity at lower interest rates; and (iii) a decrease in depreciation expense within GRIR from fully depreciated land improvement assets. 

39 

The following represents the remaining components that comprised net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders: 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   three   operating properties and   two   land parcel for gains totaling   $9.6 million  , as compared to gains of   $27.8 million   from the sale of   two   operating properties during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .   

40 

Comparison of the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to   2015  :

Minimum rent increased as follows:    

$9.5 million increase from rent commencing at development properties; 

$10.8 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and 

$5.4 million increase in minimum rent from same properties, reflecting a $7.3 million increase from redevelopments, rental rate growth on new and renewal leases, and contractual rent steps, offset by a $1.9 million charge to straight line rent primarily attributable to expected early terminations; 

reduced by $4.9 million from the sale of operating properties.  
       
  Recoveries from tenants represent reimbursements to us for tenants' pro-rata share of the operating, maintenance, and real estate tax expenses that we incur to operate our shopping centers.  Recoveries from tenants increased as follows: 

$2.4 million increase from rent commencing at development properties; 

$3.2 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and 

$3.4 million increase from same properties associated with higher recoverable costs; 

reduced by $1.9 million from the sale of operating properties.   
       
  Other income, which consists of incidental income earned at our centers, increased   $2.7 million   as follows: 

$1.7 million in same properties primarily as a result of lease termination and easement fees; and  

$774,000 in parking income related to the acquisition of Market Common Clarendon. 
       
  We earned fees, at market-based rates, for asset management, property management, leasing, acquisition, and financing services that we provided to our co-investment partnerships and third parties as follows: 

Asset management fees increased due to higher property values in our investment partnerships.  Leasing commissions and other fees increased during 2016 due to a greater number of leasing transactions. 

41 

Changes in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table:    

Depreciation and amortization costs increased as follows: 
             
    $3.6 million increase as we began depreciating costs at development properties where tenant spaces were completed and became available for occupancy; 
                
    $5.7 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and 
                
    $3.5 million increase from same properties, attributable to recent capital improvements and redevelopments;  
                
    reduced by $2.3 million from the sale of operating properties and other corporate asset disposals.  
       
  Operating and maintenance costs increased as follows:   
             
    $1.9 million increase from operations commencing at development properties;

    $2.2 million increase from new acquisitions of operating properties; and  
                 
    reduced by $1.2 million from sold properties. 
       
  Other operating expenses increased   $1.0 million   primarily due to higher transaction costs associated with property acquisition and pursuit costs offset by less tax expense. 

42 

The following table presents the components of other expense (income):   

The   $7.9 million   decrease in total interest expense is due to: 
             
    $11.4 million   decrease in interest on notes payable due to lower interest rates from refinancing and deleveraging activities during 2015 and the early redemption of our   $300 million   notes in August 2016; offset by 

$1.2 million   increase related to higher average balances on unsecured credit facilities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ; and 

$2.8 million   increase due to lower interest capitalization on our development and redevelopment projects. 
       
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recognized a   $1.7 million   impairment loss on one operating property and one parcel of land that have since been sold.   We did not recognize any impairments for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  In connection with the early redemption of the   $300 million   notes, we recognized a $13.9 million charge, including a $13.2 million make-whole premium and $700,000 of unamortized debt issuance costs.   
    
  Net investment income increased $1.5 million, driven by unrealized losses within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
  We recognized a   $40.6 million   charge to settle $220 million of forward starting interest rate swaps related to new debt previously expected to be issued in 2017.  As a result of our July 2016 equity offering and the early redemption of the $300 million notes in August 2016, the Company believed that the issuance of new fixed rate debt within the remaining period of the forward starting swaps was probable to no longer occur. Accordingly, we ceased hedge accounting and reclassified the   $40.6 million   paid to settle the forward starting swaps from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. 

43 

Our equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships increased as follows:    

The   $28.6 million   increase in our equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is largely attributed to (i) an increase in our share of the gain on sales of real estate within our GRIR, Columbia I, Columbia II, and Other investments in real estate partnerships; (ii) interest expense savings within GRIR resulting from decreased debt balances and refinancing activity at lower interest rates; and (iii) and a decrease in depreciation expense within GRIR  from fully depreciated land improvement assets. 
    
  The following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders: 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold   seven   operating properties and   twelve   land parcels resulting in gains of   $23.0 million  , compared to gains of   $34.2 million   from the sale of   four   operating properties during   2015  . 

44 

Supplemental Earnings Information 
    
    We use certain non-GAAP performance measures, in addition to the required GAAP presentations, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the Company's operational results.  We manage our entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure, although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval.  Therefore, we believe presenting our pro-rata share of operating results regardless of ownership structure, along with other non-GAAP  measures, makes comparisons of other REITs' operating results to the Company's more meaningful. We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change. 
    
  Pro-Rata Same Property NOI:       
  Our pro-rata same property NOI, excluding termination fees, grew from the following major components:   

(1)     See the end of the Supplemental Earnings Information section for a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.   

Base rent increased   $3.0 million   and   $10.0 million   during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, driven by increases in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases and contractual rent steps in our existing leases, with occupancy remaining flat.   
    
  Recovery revenue increased   $508,000   and   $836,000   during the  three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as a result of increases in recoverable costs, as noted below.   
       
  Other income increased   $362,000   and   $2.8 million   during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, as a result of lease termination fees, easement sales, and settlements in 2016.     
    
  Operating expenses increased   $624,000   and   $1.4 million   during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to higher recoverable costs. 

45 

Same Property Rollforward: 
  Our same property pool includes the following property count, pro-rata GLA, and changes therein: 

(1)    SF adjustments arise from remeasurements or redevelopments.   

46 

NAREIT FFO and Core FFO:       
  Our reconciliation of net income attributable to common stock and unit holders to NAREIT FFO and Core FFO is as follows: 

(1)    Includes Regency's pro-rata share of unconsolidated investment partnerships, net of pro-rata share attributable to    noncontrolling interests.   

47 

Reconciliation of Same Property NOI to Nearest GAAP Measure:       
    
  Our reconciliation of property revenues and property expenses to Same Property NOI, on a pro-rata basis, is as follows:  

(1)    Includes revenues and expenses attributable to non-same property, sold property, development property, and corporate activities.  
   (2)    Includes straight-line rental income, net of reserves, above and below market rent amortization, other fees, and noncontrolling interest. 
   (3)    Includes non-NOI expenses incurred at our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, including those separated out above for our consolidated properties.  

48 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  General 
    
  We utilize cash flows generated from operating, investing, and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce risk, finance our development and redevelopment projects, fund our targeted investments, and maintain financial flexibility.  We continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity to repay maturing debt or fund our capital commitments.  
    
  Our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership.  The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units.  All debt is held by our Operating Partnership or by our co-investment partnerships.  Based upon our available sources of capital, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs.  In addition to its   $40.9 million   of cash, the Company has the following additional sources of capital available:   

We operate our business such that we expect net cash provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our distributions to our common and preferred share and unit holders, which were   $165.1 million   and   $152.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Our dividend distribution policy is set by our Board of Directors, who monitors our financial position.  Our Board of Directors recently declared our common stock quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, payable on November 30, 2016.  Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be subject to capital requirements and availability.  We plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes.   
    
  During the next twelve months, we estimate that we will require approximately $258.1 million of cash, including $127.4 million to complete in-process developments and redevelopments, $117.3 million to repay maturing debt, and $13.4 million to fund our pro-rata share of estimated capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships for repayment of debt.  If we start new developments or redevelop additional shopping centers, our cash requirements will increase.  
    
  We endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets.  At   September 30, 2016  , 83.0% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered.  Such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the Line.  Our coverage ratio, including our pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 3.2 times and 2.7 times for the trailing four quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  We define our coverage ratio as earnings before interest, taxes, investment transaction profits net of deal costs, depreciation and amortization ( Core EBITDA ) divided by the sum of the gross interest and scheduled mortgage principal paid to our lenders plus dividends paid to our preferred stockholders. 
  
   49 

Our Line, Term Loan, and unsecured loans require that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  We are in compliance with these covenants at   September 30, 2016   and expect to remain in compliance.   
    
  Summary of Cash Flow Activity 
    
  The following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company:    

Net cash provided by operating activities: 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities increased   $0.6 million   due to: 
             
    $23.6 million   increase in cash from operating income;  
                
    $5.2 million   increase in operating cash flow distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships as several redevelopment projects were completed and began generating operating cash flows; and, 
                
    $5.1 million   net increase in cash due to timing of cash receipts and payments related to operating activities; offset by  
                
    $40.6 million   and   $7.3 million   paid during 2016 and 2015, respectively, to settle forward starting interest rate swaps put in place to hedge changes in interest rates on expected issuance of ten year fixed rate debt.  The   $40.6 million   paid in 2016 was recognized through net income since the previously forecasted transaction is now probable to no longer occur.  The   $7.3 million   paid in 2015 was recognized in Other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to earnings over the period of the ten year debt issued in 2015.

Net cash used in investing activities: 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities increased by   $246.2 million   as follows: 

Significant changes in investing activities include: 

We invested   $4.2 million   less in   2016   than   2015   on real estate development and capital improvements, as further detailed in a table below.   

We invested   $13.1 million   in our real estate partnerships during   2016   to fund our share of maturing mortgage debt and redevelopment activity, compared to   $18.6 million   during 2015. 

Distributions from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships include return of capital from sales or financing proceeds.   The   $52.5 million   received in   2016   is primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of nine shopping centers within the partnerships.  During   2015  , we received   $15.0 million  , primarily attributable to $12.7 million of proceeds from the sale of one shopping center with a co-investment partner and $2.3 million of financing proceeds. 

Acquisition of securities and proceeds from sale of securities pertain to equity and debt securities held by our captive insurance company and our deferred compensation plan.  The majority of our investing activity during 2016 relates to reallocation of plan assets.  

51 

We plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment.  We deployed capital of   $146.8 million   for the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our real estate properties, comprised of the following:  

During   2016   we acquired   one   land parcel for a new development project.   

Building and tenant improvements decreased during 2016 primarily related to timing of capital projects. 

Redevelopment expenditures are slightly higher in 2016 due to the timing, magnitude, and number of projects currently in process.  We intend to continuously improve our portfolio of shopping centers through redevelopment which can include adjacent land acquisition, existing building expansion, new out-parcel building construction, and tenant improvement costs.  The size and magnitude of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan.   

Development expenditures are lower in   2016   due to the progress towards completion of our development projects currently in process.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   five   and   seven   development projects, respectively, that were either under construction or in lease up.  See the tables below for more details about our development projects.   

Interest is capitalized on our development and redevelopment projects and is based on cumulative actual development costs expended.  We cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor opens for business.  Capitalized interest decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015 as our development or redevelopment projects neared substantial completion and we commenced fewer new projects. 

We have a staff of employees who directly support our development and redevelopment program.  Internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project.  Changes in the level of future development and redevelopment activity could adversely impact results of operations by reducing the amount of internal costs for development and redevelopment projects that may be capitalized.  A 10% reduction in development and redevelopment activity without a corresponding reduction in the compensation costs directly related to our development and redevelopment activities could result in an additional charge to net income of $1.4 million per year.

The following table details our development projects in process: 

The following table summarizes our completed development projects:

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities:    
    
  Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities increased by   $339.6 million   during   2016   ,as follows: 

Significant financing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   include the following: 

We settled   1.85 million   shares under our forward equity offering at an average price of $74.32 per share resulting in proceeds of   $137.5 million  , and 
        
  During 2015, we issued   18,125   shares of common stock through our ATM program at an average price of   $64.72   per share resulting in net proceeds of   $946,000  .   

During 2016, our dividend payments increased as a result of the greater number of common shares outstanding and an increase in our dividend rate.   

We received proceeds of   $100.0 million  , upon expanding our Term Loan during 2016 to partially fund the acquisition of Market Common Clarendon, as compared to   $140.0 million   borrowed on the Line and Term Loan in   2015   to partially fund the repayment of the $300 million notes.  

We received   $20.2 million   of mortgage proceeds in 2016 upon the encumbrance of one operating property.  During 2015, debt issuance includes $250.0 million of new fixed rate ten-year unsecured public debt. 

$46.1 million   for scheduled principal payments and three mortgage repayments.  
       
  During 2015, we used   $430.4 million   to repay debt, including: 
              
    $80.4 million   for scheduled principal payments and three mortgage repayments.  

We paid   $2.0 million   in loan closing costs during   2016  , primarily to amend the Term Loan, while we paid   $6.0 million    during 2015 for the new fixed rate unsecured public debt and the modification to our Line.

Investments in Real Estate Partnerships 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had investments in real estate partnerships of   $274.9 million   and   $306.2 million  , respectively.  The following table is a summary of the unconsolidated combined assets and liabilities of these co-investment partnerships and our pro-rata share: 

(1)    Pro-rata financial information is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with GAAP.  However, management believes that providing such information is useful to investors in assessing the impact of its investments in real estate partnership activities on our operations, which includes such items on a single line presentation under the equity method in its consolidated financial statements. 

Our equity method investments in real estate partnerships consist of the following:       

55 

Notes Payable - Investments in Real Estate Partnerships  
    
  Scheduled principal repayments on notes payable held by our investments in real estate partnerships were as follows:    

At   September 30, 2016  , our investments in real estate partnerships had notes payable of   $1.3 billion   maturing through   2031  , of which   98.5%   had a weighted average fixed interest rate of   4.9%  .  The remaining notes payable float over LIBOR and had a weighted average variable interest rate of   2.0%  .  These notes payable are all non-recourse, and our pro-rata share was   $476.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .   As notes payable mature, we expect they will be repaid from proceeds from new borrowings and/or partner capital contributions.  We are obligated to contribute our pro-rata share to fund maturities if they are not refinanced.  We believe that our partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements.  In the event that a co-investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, we would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call.     
    
  Management fee income 
    
  In addition to earning our pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these co-investment partnerships, we receive fees, as shown below:

Environmental Matters 
    
  We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining to chemicals used by the dry cleaning industry, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and underground petroleum storage tanks.  We believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations.  Generally, we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems.  Where available, we have applied and been accepted into state-sponsored environmental programs.  We have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination.  We have also placed environmental insurance, where possible, on specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk.  We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites.  We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   we had accrued liabilities of   $8.9 million   for our pro-rata share of environmental remediation.  We believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations; however, we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us. 

Inflation/Deflation 
    
  Inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the future.  Substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.  Most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.  In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates.  However, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, minimum rents and percentage rents will decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines.  Occupancy declines resulting from a weak economic period will also likely result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.
