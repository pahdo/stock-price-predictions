Note 1.  Organization  

Horizon Technology
Finance Corporation (the  Company ) was organized as a Delaware corporation on March 16, 2010 and is an externally
managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company. The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development company
( BDC ) under the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment
company ( RIC ) as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).
As a RIC, the Company generally is not subject to corporate-level federal income tax on the portion of its taxable income and capital
gains the Company distributes to its stockholders. The Company primarily makes secured debt investments to development-stage companies
in the technology, life science, healthcare information and services and cleantech industries. All of the Company s debt
investments consist of loans secured by all of, or a portion of, the applicable debtor company s tangible and intangible
assets. 

On October 28,
2010, the Company completed an initial public offering ( IPO ) and its common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market under the symbol  HRZN . The Company was formed to continue and expand the business of Compass Horizon Funding
Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which commenced operations in March 2008 and became the Company s wholly
owned subsidiary upon the completion of the Company s IPO. 

Horizon Credit II
LLC ( Credit II ) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on June 28, 2011, with the Company as its sole
equity member. Credit II is a special purpose bankruptcy remote entity and is a separate legal entity from the Company. Any assets
conveyed to Credit II are not available to creditors of the Company or any other entity other than Credit II s lenders. 

Longview SBIC GP LLC
and Longview SBIC LP (collectively,  Horizon SBIC ) were formed as a Delaware limited liability company and Delaware
limited partnership, respectively, on February 11, 2011. Horizon SBIC are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and were formed
in anticipation of obtaining a license to operate a small business investment company from the U. S. Small Business Administration.
There has been no activity in Horizon SBIC since its inception. 

The Company formed
Horizon Funding 2013-1 LLC ( 2013-1 LLC ) as a Delaware limited liability company on June 7, 2013 and Horizon Funding
Trust 2013-1 ( 2013-1 Trust  and, together with 2013-1 LLC, the  2013-1 Entities ) as a Delaware trust
on June 18, 2013. The 2013-1 Entities are special purpose bankruptcy remote entities and are separate legal entities from the Company.
The Company formed the 2013-1 Entities for purposes of securitizing $189.3 million of secured loans (the  2013-1 Securitization )
and issuing fixed-rate asset-backed notes in an aggregate principal amount of $90 million (the  Asset-Backed Notes ).
2013-1 LLC and 2013-1 Trust have been dissolved as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company has also
established an additional wholly owned subsidiary, which is structured as a Delaware limited liability company, to hold the assets
of a portfolio company acquired in connection with foreclosure or bankruptcy which is a separate legal entity from the Company. 

The Company s
investment strategy is to maximize the investment portfolio s return by generating current income from the debt investments
the Company makes and capital appreciation from the warrants the Company receives when making such debt investments. The Company
has entered into an investment management agreement, (the  Investment Management Agreement ) with Horizon Technology
Finance Management LLC (the  Advisor ), under which the Advisor manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides
investment advisory services to, the Company. 

On March 24, 2015,
the Company completed a public offering of 2,000,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $13.95 per share,
for total net proceeds to the Company of $26.5 million, after deducting underwriting commission and discounts and other offering
expenses (the  2015 Offering ).

Note 2.  Basis of presentation and significant
accounting policies  

The consolidated financial
statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP )
and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Articles 6 and 10 of Regulation S-X ( Regulation S-X )
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). In the opinion of management, the consolidated
financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications that are necessary for the fair presentation of financial results
as of and for the periods presented. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The current period s results of operations are not
necessarily indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the year. Therefore, the unaudited financial statements and
notes should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Principles of consolidation   

As required under
GAAP and Regulation S-X, the Company will generally consolidate its investment in a company that is an investment company
subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Accordingly, the Company
consolidated the results of the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements. 

Use of estimates   

In preparing the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the balance sheet and
income and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly
susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the valuation of investments. 

Fair value   

The Company records
all of its investments at fair value in accordance with relevant GAAP, which establishes a framework used to measure fair value
and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. The Company has categorized its investments carried at fair value, based
on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy as more fully described in Note 5. Fair value
is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than
an entity specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company s own assumptions are
set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement
date. 

The availability of
observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example,
the type of product, whether the product is new, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market
and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable
in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company
in determining fair value is greatest for financial instruments classified as Level 3. 

See Note
5 for additional information regarding fair value. 

Segments   

The Company has determined
that it has a single reporting segment and operating unit structure. The Company lends to and invests in portfolio companies in
various technology, life science, healthcare information and services and cleantech industries. The Company separately evaluates
the performance of each of its lending and investment relationships. However, because each of these debt investments and investment
relationships has similar business and economic characteristics, they have been aggregated into a single lending and investment
segment.

and Subsidiaries  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  

Investments   

Investments are recorded
at fair value. The Company s board of directors (the  Board ) determines the fair value of the Company s
portfolio investments. The Company has the intent to hold its debt investments for the foreseeable future or until maturity or
payoff. 

Interest on debt investments
is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding. Interest income is determined
using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding. Generally, when a debt investment becomes
90 days or more past due, or if the Company otherwise does not expect to receive interest and principal repayments, the debt
investment is placed on non-accrual status and the recognition of interest income may be discontinued. Interest payments received
on non-accrual debt investments may be recognized as income, on a cash basis, or applied to principal depending upon management s
judgment at the time the debt investment is placed on non-accrual status. As of September 30, 2016, there were four debt investments
on non-accrual status with a cost of $27.7 million and a fair value of $12.0 million. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2015, the Company recognized interest income payments of $0.04 million and $0.2 million, respectively, received from one portfolio
company whose debt investment was on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2015, there was one investment on non-accrual status
with a cost of $2.7 million and a fair value of $0.5 million. 

The Company receives
a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting its business, including advisory fees, commitment fees, amendment
fees, non-utilization fees, success fees and prepayment fees. In a limited number of cases, the Company may also receive a non-refundable
deposit earned upon the termination of a transaction. Debt investment origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs,
are deferred and, along with unearned income, are amortized as a level-yield adjustment over the respective term of the debt investment.
All other income is recognized when earned. Fees for counterparty debt investment commitments with multiple debt investments are
allocated to each debt investment based upon each debt investment s relative fair value. When a debt investment is placed
on non-accrual status, the amortization of the related fees and unearned income is discontinued until the debt investment is returned
to accrual status. 

Certain debt investment
agreements also require the borrower to make an ETP, that is accrued into interest receivable and taken into income over the life
of the debt investment to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company will generally cease accruing the income
if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or the Company does not expect the borrower to be able to pay the ETP when
due. The proportion of the Company s total investment income that resulted from the portion of ETPs not received in cash
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 7.1% and 6.5%, respectively. The proportion of the Company s total
investment income that resulted from the portion of ETPs not received in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 was 12.1% and 7.1%, respectively. 

In connection with
substantially all lending arrangements, the Company receives warrants to purchase shares of stock from the borrower. The warrants
are recorded as assets at estimated fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The warrants are considered
loan fees and are also recorded as unearned income on the grant date. The unearned income is recognized as interest income over
the contractual life of the related debt investment in accordance with the Company s income recognition policy. Subsequent
to debt investment origination, the fair value of the warrants is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Any adjustment
to fair value is recorded through earnings as net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Gains and losses from
the disposition of the warrants or stock acquired from the exercise of warrants are recognized as realized gains and losses on
investments. 

Realized gains or
losses on the sale of investments, or upon the determination that an investment balance, or portion thereof, is not recoverable,
are calculated using the specific identification method. The Company measures realized gains or losses by calculating the difference
between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment. Net change in unrealized appreciation
or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of the Company s portfolio investments during the reporting period,
including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.

Debt issuance costs   

Debt issuance costs
are fees and other direct incremental costs incurred by the Company in obtaining debt financing from its lenders and issuing debt
securities. The unamortized balance of debt issuance costs as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $1.7 million and
$1.9 million, respectively. These amounts are amortized and included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations
over the life of the borrowings. The accumulated amortization balances as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $4.3
million and $3.9 million, respectively. The amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.1
million and $0.2 million, respectively. The amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.4
million and $0.7 million, respectively. 

Income taxes   

As a BDC, the Company
has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment
applicable to RICs. In order to qualify as a RIC and to avoid corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on the income distributed
to stockholders, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements
and to timely distribute dividends out of assets legally available for distribution to its stockholders of an amount generally
at least equal to 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The Company, among other
things, has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which generally relieves the
Company from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax has been recorded
in the financial statements. Differences between taxable income and net increase in net assets resulting from operations either
can be temporary, meaning they will reverse in the future, or permanent. In accordance with Paragraph 946-205-45-3 of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB s ), Accounting Standards Codification, as amended ( ASC ),
permanent tax differences, such as non-deductible excise taxes paid, are reclassified from distributions in excess of net investment
income and net realized loss on investments to paid-in-capital at the end of each year. These permanent book-to-tax differences
are reclassified on the consolidated statements of changes in net assets to reflect their tax character but have no impact on total
net assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company reclassified $1.0 million to paid-in capital from distributions
in excess of net investment income of $0.9 million and net realized loss on investments of $0.1 million, which related to excise
taxes paid in prior years. 

Depending on the level
of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions
into the next tax year and pay a 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines
that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions, the Company accrues
excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, there was no U.S. federal excise tax accrual recorded. 

The Company evaluates
tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not 
to be sustained by the applicable tax authority in accordance with ASC Topic 740, as modified by ASC Topic 946. Tax benefits of
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, or uncertain tax positions, would be recorded as a tax expense
in the current year. It is the Company s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits
in income tax expense. The Company had no material uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The 2015,
2014 and 2013 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. 

Distributions   

Distributions to common
stockholders are recorded on the declaration date. The amount to be paid out as distributions is determined by the Board. Net realized
long-term capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains
for investment. 

The Company has adopted
a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of cash distributions on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder
elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Board declares a cash distribution, then stockholders who have not  opted out 
of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s
common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The Company may use newly issued shares to implement the plan or the
Company may purchase shares in the open market to fulfill its obligations under the plan.

Stock Repurchase Program   

On July 29, 2016,
the Board extended a previously authorized stock repurchase program which allows the Company to repurchase up to $5.0 million of
its common stock at prices below the Company s net asset value per share as reported in its most recent consolidated financial
statements. Under the repurchase program, the Company may, but is not obligated to, repurchase shares of its outstanding common
stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time. Any repurchases by the Company will comply
with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any applicable requirements of
the 1940 Act. Unless extended by the Board, the repurchase program will terminate on the earlier of June 30, 2017 or the repurchase
of $5.0 million of the Company s common stock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased
1,319 shares of its common stock at an average price of $11.54 on the open market at a total cost of $0.02 million. From the inception
of the stock repurchase program through September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 114,701 shares of its common stock at an average
price of $11.53 on the open market at a total cost of $1.3 million. 

Transfers of financial assets   

Assets related to
transactions that do not meet  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860   Transfers and Servicing  requirements for
accounting sale treatment are reflected in the Company s consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as investments.
Those assets are owned by special purpose entities that are consolidated in the Company s financial statements. The creditors
of the special purpose entities have received security interests in such assets, and such assets are not intended to be available
to the creditors of the Company (or any other affiliate of the Company). 

Transfers of financial
assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed
to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company   put presumptively beyond the reach
of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free
of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and (3) the
transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (a) an agreement that both entitles
and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem the assets before maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the
holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call. 

Recently adopted accounting pronouncement   

In April 2015, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ), as clarified by ASU 2015-15,  Interest Imputation
of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements  ( ASU
2015-15 ), containing guidance that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, instead of being recorded as a separate
asset. ASU 2015-15 allows an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently
amortize these deferred costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company has adopted ASU 2015-03, as clarified
by ASU 2015-15, which did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements other than corresponding
reductions to total assets and total liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Prior to adoption, the
Company recorded debt issuance costs in other assets as an asset on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Upon
adoption, the Company reclassified these costs as unamortized debt issuance costs that reduce debt in the liabilities on the consolidated
statements of assets and liabilities and retrospectively reclassified the debt issuance costs that were previously presented in
other assets as an asset as of December 31, 2015, as discussed further in Note 6.

Investment Management Agreement   

The Investment Management
Agreement was reapproved by the Board on July 29, 2016. Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Advisor determines
the composition of the Company s investment portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to the investment portfolio and
the manner of implementing such changes; identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments the Company makes
(including performing due diligence on the Company s prospective portfolio companies); and closes, monitors and administers
the investments the Company makes, including the exercise of any voting or consent rights. 

The Advisor s
services under the Investment Management Agreement are not exclusive to the Company, and the Advisor is free to furnish similar
services to other entities so long as its services to the Company are not impaired. The Advisor is a registered investment adviser
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Advisor receives fees for providing services to the Company under the Investment
Management Agreement, consisting of two components, a base management fee and an incentive fee. 

The base management
fee under the Investment Management Agreement is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of (i) the Company s gross assets,
less (ii) assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents, and is payable monthly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the base
management fee, the term  gross assets  includes any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage. In addition, the
Advisor agreed to waive its base management fee relating to the proceeds raised in the 2015 Offering, to the extent such fee is
not otherwise waived and regardless of the application of the proceeds raised, until the earlier to occur of (i) March 31, 2016
or (ii) the last day of the second consecutive calendar quarter in which the Company s net investment income exceeds distributions
declared on its shares of common stock for the applicable quarter. As of December 31, 2015, the Company met condition (ii) above
as net investment income exceeded distributions declared for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015. 

During the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Advisor waived base management fees of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, which
the Advisor would have otherwise earned on the proceeds raised in the 2015 Offering. The base management fee payable at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $0.4 million. After giving effect of the waiver, the base management fee expense was $1.1 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. After giving effect of the waiver, the base management fee expense was
$3.7 million and $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The incentive
fee has two parts, as follows: 

The first
part, which is subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism, as defined below, is calculated and payable quarterly in
arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For
this purpose,  Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income  means interest income, dividend income and any other income
(including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring,
diligence and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus expenses
for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), and
any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive
Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount,
debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income the Company has not yet received in
cash. The incentive fee with respect to the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is 20.00% of the amount, if any, by which the
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds a 1.75% (which is 7.00% annualized)
hurdle rate and a  catch-up  provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under this provision, in any
calendar quarter, the Advisor receives no incentive fee until the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income equals the hurdle rate
of 1.75%, but then receives, as a  catch-up,  100.00% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to
that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% quarterly
(which is 8.75% annualized). The effect of this  catch-up  provision is that, if Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter, the Advisor will receive 20.00% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if the
hurdle rate did not apply.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  

Pre-Incentive
Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation
or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter
in which the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the
quarterly minimum hurdle rate, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee up to the Incentive Fee Cap, defined below, even
if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. The Company s net investment
income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of the Company s gross assets used
to calculate the 2.00% base management fee. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months
and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 

Commencing
with the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2014, the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is subject to a
fee cap and deferral mechanism which is determined based upon a look-back period of up to three years and is expensed when incurred.
For this purpose, the look-back period for the incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (the  Incentive
Fee Look-back Period ) commenced on July 1, 2014 and increases by one quarter in length at the end of each calendar quarter
until June 30, 2017, after which time, the Incentive Fee Look-back Period will include the relevant calendar quarter and the 11
preceding full calendar quarters. Each quarterly incentive fee payable on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is subject to
a cap (the  Incentive Fee Cap ) and a deferral mechanism through which the Advisor may recoup a portion of such deferred
incentive fees (collectively, the  Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism ). The Incentive Fee Cap is equal to (a)
20.00% of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period less (b) cumulative
incentive fees of any kind paid to the Advisor during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period. To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is
zero or a negative value in any calendar quarter, the Company will not pay an incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment
Income to the Advisor in that quarter. To the extent that the payment of incentive fees on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
is limited by the Incentive Fee Cap, the payment of such fees will be deferred and paid in subsequent calendar quarters up to three
years after their date of deferment, subject to certain limitations, which are set forth in the Investment Management Agreement.
The Company only pays incentive fees on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income to the extent allowed by the Incentive Fee Cap
and Deferral Mechanism.  Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return  during any Incentive Fee Look-back Period means the
sum of (a) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and the base management fee for each calendar quarter during the Incentive Fee
Look-back Period and (b) the sum of cumulative realized capital gains and losses, cumulative unrealized capital appreciation and
cumulative unrealized capital depreciation during the applicable Incentive Fee Look-back Period. 

The second
part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or, upon termination of the
Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.00% of the Company s realized capital gains,
if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of the election to be a BDC through the end of each calendar year, computed net of
all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis through the end of such year, less all previous
amounts paid in respect of the capital gain incentive fee. However, in accordance with GAAP, the Company is required to include
the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee on a quarterly
basis, as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted
to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement.

The performance based
incentive fee expense was $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The performance based incentive fee expense
was $2.1 million and $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The incentive fee on Pre-Incentive
Fee Net Investment Income was subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, which resulted in $0.9 million of reduced expense and additional net investment income. There was no performance based
incentive fee payable as of September 30, 2016 as the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income was subject to the
Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. The performance based incentive fee payable as of December 31, 2015 was $1.0 million.
The entire incentive fee payable as of December 31, 2015 represented part one of the incentive fee. 

Administration Agreement   

The Company entered

Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and the Company s allocable
portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of the Company s Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer
and their respective staffs. The administrative fee expense was $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The administrative fee expense was $0.8 million and $0.9 million for the nine months ended September

Note 5.  Fair value  

The Company uses fair
value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in certain
instances, there are no quoted market prices for certain assets or liabilities. In cases where quoted market prices are not available,
fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected
by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates
may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the asset or liability. 

Fair value measurements
focus on exit prices in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants
at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity
for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In
such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current
market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment. 

The Company s
fair value measurements are classified into a fair value hierarchy based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are
traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The three categories within the hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities. 

Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active, and model-based
valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially
the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Horizon Technology Finance Corporation
and Subsidiaries  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  

Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no
market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include
financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques,
as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

Investments are valued
at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation
firms which are engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment lacking a readily
available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied
valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with 25% (based on fair value) of the
Company s valuation of portfolio companies lacking readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent
valuation firm. 

Because there is not
a readily available market value for most of the investments in its portfolio, the Company values substantially all of its portfolio
investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining
the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company's investments may
fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company's investments may differ significantly from the values
that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company
may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise
are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or
liquidation sale, the Company could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded such portfolio
investment. 

Cash and interest
receivable:   The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These financial instruments are not recorded
at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy described above. 

Money market funds:   The
carrying amounts are valued at their net asset value as of the close of business on the day of valuation. These financial instruments
are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy described above
as these funds can be redeemed daily. 

Debt investments:   For
variable rate debt investments which re-price frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, carrying values are a reasonable
estimate of fair values. The fair value of fixed rate debt investments is estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows
using the period end rates at which similar debt investments would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the
same remaining maturities. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the hypothetical market yields used ranged from 11% to
25%. Significant increases (decreases) in this unobservable input would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.
These assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy described
above. 

Under certain circumstances,
the Company may use an alternative technique to value debt investments that better reflects its fair value such as the use of multiple
probability weighted cash flow models when the expected future cash flows contain elements of variability.  

Warrant investments:   The
Company values its warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model incorporating the following material assumptions: 

Underlying asset value of the issuer is estimated based on information available, including any
information regarding the most recent rounds of borrower funding. Significant increases (decreases) in this unobservable input
would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.   

Volatility, or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of the changes in the warrant price,
is based on indices of publicly traded companies similar in nature to the underlying company issuing the warrant. A total of seven
such indices are used. Significant increases (decreases) in this unobservable input would result in a significantly higher (lower)
fair value measurement.   

Horizon Technology Finance Corporation
and Subsidiaries  

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  

The risk-free interest rates are derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The risk-free
interest rates are calculated based on a weighted average of the risk-free interest rates that correspond closest to the expected
remaining life of the warrant.   

Other adjustments, including a marketability discount on private company warrants, are estimated
based on management s judgment about the general industry environment.   

Historical portfolio experience on cancellations and exercises of the Company s warrants
are utilized as the basis for determining the estimated time to exit of the warrants in each financial reporting period. Warrants
may be exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers or IPOs, and cancelled due to events such as bankruptcies, restructuring
activities or additional financings. These events cause the expected remaining life assumption to be shorter than the contractual
term of the warrants. Significant increases (decreases) in this unobservable input would result in significantly higher (lower)
fair value measurement.   

Under certain circumstances
the Company may use an alternative technique to value warrants that better reflects the warrants  fair value, such as an
expected settlement of a warrant in the near term or a model that incorporates a put feature associated with the warrant. The fair
value may be determined based on the expected proceeds to be received from such settlement or based on the net present value of
the expected proceeds from the put option.  

The fair value of
the Company s warrants held in publicly traded companies is determined based on inputs that are readily available in public
markets or can be derived from information available in public markets. Therefore, the Company has categorized these warrants as
Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy described above. The fair value of the Company s warrants held in private companies
is determined using both observable and unobservable inputs and represents management s best estimate of what market participants
would use in pricing the warrants at the measurement date. Therefore, the Company has categorized these warrants as Level 3
within the fair value hierarchy described above. These assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Equity investments: 
The fair value of an equity investment in a privately held company is initially the face value of the amount invested. The Company
adjusts the fair value of equity investments in private companies upon the completion of a new third-party round of equity financing.
The Company may make adjustments to fair value, absent a new equity financing event, based upon positive or negative changes in
a portfolio company s financial or operational performance. Significant increases (decreases) in this unobservable input
would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. The Company has categorized these equity investments as
Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy described above. The fair value of an equity investment in a publicly traded company is
based upon the closing public share price on the date of measurement. Therefore, the Company has categorized these equity investments
as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy described above. These assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Other investments:
 Other investments are valued based on the facts and circumstances of the underlying agreement. The Company currently values
one contractual agreement using a multiple probability weighted cash flow model as the contractual future cash flows contain elements
of variability. Significant changes in the estimated cash flows and probability weightings would result in a significantly higher
or lower fair value measurement. The Company has categorized this other investment as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy described
above. This asset is recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 

The following tables
provide a summary of quantitative information about the Company s Level 3 fair value measurements of its investments as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition to the techniques and inputs noted in the table below, according to the Company s
valuation policy, the Company may also use other valuation techniques and methodologies when determining its fair value measurements.

Borrowings:   The
carrying amount of borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility (the  Key Facility ) with KeyBank
National Association ( Key ) approximates fair value due to the variable interest rate of the Key Facility and is categorized
as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy described above. Additionally, the Company considers its creditworthiness in determining
the fair value of such borrowings. The fair value of the fixed rate 2019 Notes (as defined in Note 6) is based on the closing public
share price on the date of measurement. On September 30, 2016, the closing price of the 2019 Notes on the New York Stock Exchange
was $25.64 per note, or $33.8 million. Therefore, the Company has categorized this borrowing as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy
described above. 

Off-balance-sheet
instruments:   Fair values for off-balance-sheet lending commitments are based on fees currently charged to enter
into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standings.
Therefore, the Company has categorized these instruments as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy described above.

for 2016 and 2015 have been measured as of the reporting date and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these financial
statements subsequent to that date. As such, the fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the reporting date may
be different than amounts reported. 

As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the recorded balances equaled fair values of all the Company s financial instruments, except
for the Company s 2019 Notes, as previously described. 

Off-balance-sheet instruments   

The Company assumes
interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result,
the fair values of the Company s financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change, and that change may
be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent
believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts
to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new debt investments and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate
the Company s overall interest rate risk.

Note 6.  Borrowings  

The following table
shows the Company s borrowings as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

In accordance with
the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that the Company s asset
coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, the asset coverage for
borrowed amounts was 250%. 

On August 12, 2015,
the Company amended the Key Facility to (1) add a $20 million commitment to the existing $50 million commitment and (2) extend
the term of the Key Facility. On April 27, 2016, the Company added a $25 million commitment to the existing $70 million commitment.
The Key Facility has an accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total loan commitment to $150 million from the current
$95 million commitment. The Key Facility is collateralized by all debt investments and warrants held by Credit II and permits an
advance rate of up to 50% of eligible debt investments held by Credit II. The Key Facility contains covenants that, among other
things, require the Company to maintain a minimum net worth and to restrict the debt investments securing the Key Facility to certain
criteria for qualified debt investments and includes portfolio company concentration limits as defined in the related loan agreement.
The Key Facility has a three-year revolving period followed by a two-year amortization period and matures on August 12, 2020. The
interest rate is based upon the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), plus a spread of 3.25%, with a LIBOR
floor of 0.75%. Based on a LIBOR rate of 0.53% and 0.43% on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the interest
rate was 4.00% as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The average rate for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 was 4.00%. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had borrowing capacity of $32.0 million, of which $10.6 million
was available, subject to existing terms and advance rates. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had available borrowing capacity
of $2.0 million, subject to existing terms and advance rates. 

On March 23, 2012,
the Company issued and sold an aggregate principal amount of $30 million of 7.375% senior unsecured notes due in 2019 and on April
18, 2012, pursuant to the underwriters  30 day option to purchase additional notes, the Company sold an additional $3 million
of such notes (collectively, the  2019 Notes ). The 2019 Notes will mature on March 15, 2019 and may be redeemed in
whole or in part at the Company s option at any time or from time to time at a redemption price of $25 per security plus
accrued and unpaid interest. The 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.375% per year payable quarterly on March 15, June 15,
September 15 and December 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes are the Company s direct unsecured obligations and (i) rank equally
in right of payment with the Company s future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) are senior in right of payment to any of the Company s
future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2019 Notes; (iii) are effectively subordinated to all of
the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company
subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and (iv) are structurally subordinated
to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company s subsidiaries. A s
of  September 30, 2016 , the Company was in material compliance with
the terms of the 2019 Notes.  The 2019 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  HTF .

On June 28, 2013,
the Company completed the 2013-1 Securitization. In connection with the 2013-1 Securitization, 2013-1 Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, issued $90 million in the Asset-Backed Notes, which were rated A1(sf) by Moody s Investors Service, Inc.
The Asset-Backed Notes were issued by 2013-1 Trust and were backed by a pool of loans made to certain portfolio companies of the
Company and secured by certain assets of such portfolio companies. The Asset-Backed Notes were secured obligations of 2013-1 Trust
and non-recourse to the Company. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Asset-Backed Notes, the Company made customary
representations, warranties and covenants. The Asset-Backed Notes bore interest at a fixed rate of 3.00% per annum and had a stated
maturity of May 15, 2018. As of September 30, 2016 the Asset-Backed Notes were repaid in full. 

Under the terms of
the Asset-Backed Notes, the Company was required to maintain a reserve cash balance, funded through principal collections from
the underlying securitized debt portfolio, which may be used to make monthly interest and principal payments on the Asset-Backed
Notes. The Company had segregated these funds and classified them as restricted investments in money market funds on the consolidated
statements of assets and liabilities. The balance of restricted investments in money market funds was $1.1 million as of December
31, 2015. 

Note 7.  Financial instruments with off-balance-sheet
risk  

In the normal course
of business, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its borrowers.
These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess
of the amount recognized in the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities. The Company attempts to limit its credit risk
by conducting extensive due diligence and obtaining collateral where appropriate. 

The balance of unfunded
commitments to extend credit was $7.0 million and $10.0 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Commitments
to extend credit consist principally of the unused portions of commitments that obligate the Company to extend credit, such as
revolving credit arrangements or similar transactions. These commitments are often subject to financial or non-financial milestones
and other conditions to borrow that must be achieved before the commitment can be drawn. In addition, the commitments generally
have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment
amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 

The following table
provides the Company s unfunded commitments by portfolio company as of September 30, 2016: 

The table above also
provides the fair value of the Company s unfunded commitment liability as of September 30, 2016 totaling $0.1 million. The
fair value at inception of the delay draw credit agreements is equal to the fees and/or warrants received to enter into these agreements,
taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit profile. The unfunded commitment
liability reflects the fair value of these future funding commitments and is included in the Company s consolidated statement
of assets and liabilities. 

N ote 8.  Concentrations
of credit risk  

The Company s
debt investments consist primarily of loans to development-stage companies at various stages of development in the technology,
life science, healthcare information and services and cleantech industries. Many of these companies may have relatively limited
operating histories and also may experience variation in operating results. Many of these companies conduct business in regulated
industries and could be affected by changes in government regulations. Most of the Company s borrowers will need additional
capital to satisfy their continuing working capital needs and other requirements, and in many instances, to service the interest
and principal payments on the loans.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  

The Company s
largest debt investments may vary from period to period as new debt investments are recorded and existing debt investments are
repaid. The Company s five largest debt investments, at cost, represented 23% and 21% of total debt investments outstanding
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. No single debt investment represented more than 10% of the total
debt investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Investment income, consisting of interest and fees, can fluctuate
significantly upon repayment of large debt investments. Interest income from the five largest debt investments accounted for 18%
of total interest and fee income on investments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Interest income from the
five largest debt investments accounted for 18% of total interest and fee income on investments for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.

On October 28, 2016, the Board declared
three monthly distributions of $0.10 per share, a reduction from the prior rate of $0.115 per month, payable as set forth in the
following table: 

After paying distributions
of $0.345 per share and earning $0.38 per share for the quarter, the Company s undistributed spillover income as of September
30, 2016 was $0.22 per share. Spillover income includes any ordinary income and net capital gains from the preceding tax years
that were not distributed during such tax years. 

Note 10. Financial highlights  

The following table
shows financial highlights for the Company: 

(1)  Distributions are determined based on taxable income
calculated in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from amounts determined under GAAP due to (i) changes in
unrealized appreciation and depreciation, (ii) temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition, and (iii)
the amount of spillover income carried over from a given tax year for distribution in the following tax year. The final determination
of taxable income for each tax year, as well as the tax attributes for distributions in such tax year, will be made after the
close of the tax year.

Overview  

We are a specialty finance
company that lends to and invests in development-stage companies in the technology, life science, healthcare information and services
and cleantech industries, which we refer to as our  Target Industries.  Our investment objective is to maximize our
investment portfolio s total return by generating current income from the debt investments we make and capital appreciation
from the warrants we receive when making such debt investments. We are focused on making secured debt investments, which we refer
to collectively as  Venture Loans,  to venture capital backed companies in our Target Industries, which we refer to
as  Venture Lending.  We also selectively provide Venture Loans to publicly traded companies in our Target Industries.
Our debt investments are typically secured by first liens or first liens behind a revolving line of credit, or Senior Term Loans.
As of September 30, 2016, 97.5%, or $196.0 million, of our debt investment portfolio at fair value consisted of Senior Term Loans.
Venture Lending is typically characterized by (1) the making of a secured debt investment after a venture capital or equity investment
in the portfolio company has been made, which investment provides a source of cash to fund the portfolio company s debt service
obligations under the Venture Loan, (2) the senior priority of the Venture Loan which requires repayment of the Venture Loan prior
to the equity investors realizing a return on their capital, (3) the relatively rapid amortization of the Venture Loan and (4)
the lender s receipt of warrants or other success fees with the making of the Venture Loan. 

We are an externally managed,
closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a
RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As a BDC, we are required to comply with
regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to, finance our investments
through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined
in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our assessment of
market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level
federal income taxes on our investment company taxable income and our net capital gain that we distribute to our stockholders as
long as we meet certain source-of-income, distribution, asset diversification and other requirements. 

Compass Horizon Funding
Company LLC, or Compass Horizon, our predecessor company, commenced operations in March 2008. We were formed in March 2010 for
the purpose of acquiring Compass Horizon and continuing its business as a public entity. 

Our investment activities,
and our day-to-day operations, are managed by our Advisor and supervised by our board of directors, or the Board, of which a majority
of the members are independent of us. Under an amended and restated investment management agreement, or the Investment Management
Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Advisor a base management fee and an incentive fee for its advisory services to us. We have
also entered into an administration agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with our Advisor under which we have agreed to
reimburse our Advisor for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our Advisor in performing its obligations
under the Administration Agreement. 

Portfolio composition and investment activity  

The following table shows
our portfolio by type of investment as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The following table shows
total portfolio investment activity as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

We receive payments on
our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of
our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments may fluctuate significantly
from period to period. 

The following table shows
our debt investments by industry sector as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The largest debt investments
in our portfolio may vary from year to year as new debt investments are originated and existing debt investments are repaid. Our
five largest debt investments represented 23% and 21% of total debt investments outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. No single debt investment represented more than 10% of our total debt investments as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. 

Debt investment asset quality  

We use an internal credit
rating system which rates each debt investment on a scale of 4 to 1, with 4 being the highest credit quality rating and 3 being
the rating for a standard level of risk. A rating of 2 represents an increased level of risk and, while no loss is currently anticipated
for a 2-rated debt investment, there is potential for future loss of principal. A rating of 1 represents a deteriorating credit
quality and a high degree of risk of loss of principal. Our internal credit rating system is not a national credit rating system.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our debt investments had a weighted average credit rating of 2.9 and 3.0, respectively.
The following table shows the classification of our debt investment portfolio by credit rating as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015: 

As of September 30, 2016, there were four debt
investments with an internal credit rating of 1, with a cost of $27.7 million and a fair value of $12.0 million. As of December
31, 2015, there was one debt investment with an internal credit rating of 1, with a cost of $2.7 million and a fair value of $0.5
million. 

Consolidated results of operations  

As a BDC and a RIC, we
are subject to certain constraints on our operations, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. The consolidated
results of operations described below may not be indicative of the results we report in future periods. 

Comparison of the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

The following table shows
consolidated results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Net increase in net assets
resulting from operations can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized
gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments. As a result, quarterly comparisons of net increase
in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful. 

Investment income   

Total investment income
decreased by $0.8 million, or 9.7%, to $7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total investment income consisted primarily of $6.8 million
in interest income from investments, which included $1.4 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and end-of-term
payments, or ETPs, and $0.8 million in fee income. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, total investment income consisted
primarily of $7.7 million in interest income from investments, which included $1.1 million in income from the accretion
of origination fees and ETPs and $0.7 million in fee income. Interest income on investments decreased by $0.9 million, or 11.5%,
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest income on investments
decreased primarily due to a decrease of $23.0 million, or 9.7%, in the average size of our investment portfolio. Fee income, which
includes success fee and prepayment fee income on debt investments, increased by $0.1 million, or 9.3%, to $0.8 million primarily
due to fees earned on higher principal prepayments received during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015. 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, our dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments was 14.2%. We calculate the yield
on dollar-weighted average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income during the period divided by
(2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding
the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield
represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or
any sales load paid by investors. 

Investment income, consisting
of interest income and fees on debt investments, can fluctuate significantly upon repayment of large debt investments. Interest
income from the five largest debt investments in the aggregate accounted for 18% of investment income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Expenses   

Total net expenses decreased
by $1.1 million, or 25.1%, to $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Total expenses for each period consisted of interest expense, base management fee, incentive and administrative
fees, professional fees and general and administrative expenses. 

Interest expense decreased
by $0.02 million, or 1.5%, to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs, decreased primarily due to
a decrease in average borrowings of $1.5 million, or 1.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Base management fee expense
remained flat at $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015, after giving effect to a waiver of $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Base management fee was flat
primarily due to a decrease of $23.0 million, or 9.7%, in the average size of our investment portfolio, offset by the waiver of
$0.1 million of base management fee for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, the incentive fee expense was effectively zero as the incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income
was subject to the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism under our Investment Management Agreement which resulted in $0.9 million
of reduced expense and additional net investment income. The incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was subject
to the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism due to net realized and unrealized losses in the portfolio during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 totaling $10.0 million. Performance based incentive fee expense was $1.0 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. 

Administrative fee expense
decreased by $0.1 million, or 34.3%, to $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2015. Administrative fee expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in expenses incurred by
the Advisor on our behalf for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Professional fees and
general and administrative expenses primarily include legal and audit fees and insurance premiums. These expenses, in the aggregate,
remained flat at $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015. 

Net realized gains and losses and net unrealized
appreciation and depreciation   

Realized gains or losses
on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments
without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains or losses on investments include
investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments
primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously
recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. 

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, we realized net gains totaling less than $0.01 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2015,
we realized net losses totaling $1.5 million primarily due to the resolution of one debt investment partially offset by realized
gains on the sale of warrants. The debt investment was settled for a net cash payment of $4.9 million, which resulted in a realized
loss of $1.8 million and unrealized appreciation of $1.8 million as the fair value of the debt investment was adjusted on June
30, 2015 to reflect the outcome of this resolution. 

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled $10.0 million which was primarily due to the unrealized
depreciation on three debt investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, net unrealized appreciation on investments
totaled $0.9 million which was primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on one debt investment
that was settled during the period, described above, partially offset by changes in fair values of our investment portfolio. 

Comparison of the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

The following table shows
consolidated results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Net increase in net assets
resulting from operations can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized
gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments. As a result, quarterly comparisons of net increase
in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful.

increased by $3.4 million, or 15.3%, to $26.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total investment income consisted primarily of $24.6 million
in interest income from investments, which included $6.6 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and ETPs
and $1.4 million in fee income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, total investment income consisted primarily of $20.9 million
in interest income from investments, which included $3.3 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and ETPs
and $1.7 million in fee income. Interest income on investments increased by $3.7 million, or 17.9%, for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest income on investments increased primarily due to an increase
of $15.8 million, or 7.4%, in the average size of our investment portfolio and a larger amount of ETPs earned during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Fee income, which includes success fee and prepayment
fee income on debt investments, decreased by $0.3 million, or 17.6%, primarily due to seven prepayments during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to 11 prepayments during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, our dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments was 15.1% and 14.1%, respectively.
We calculate the yield on dollar-weighted average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income during
the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month
immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted
annualized yield represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect
our expenses or any sales load paid by investors. 

Investment income, consisting
of interest income and fees on debt investments, can fluctuate significantly upon repayment of large debt investments. Interest
income from the five largest debt investments in the aggregate accounted for 18% of investment income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Expenses   

Total net expenses increased
by $0.2 million, or 1.5%, to $12.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Total expenses for each period consisted of interest expense, base management fee, incentive and administrative
fees, professional fees and general and administrative expenses. 

Interest
expense increased by $0.2 million, or 4.1%, to $4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs, increased primarily
due to an increase in average borrowings of $22.0 million, or 26.4%, which was partially offset by a   decrease
in our effective cost of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Base management fee expense
increased by $0.4 million, or 12.8%, to $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, after giving effect to a waiver of $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which increase
was primarily due to an increase of $15.8 million, or 7.4%, in the average size of our investment portfolio. 

Performance based incentive
fee expense decreased by $0.3 million, or 14.0%, to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. Performance based incentive fee expense decreased because the incentive fee expense for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 was effectively zero due to the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism under our Investment
Management Agreement. This resulted in $0.9 million of reduced expense and additional net investment income for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was subject to the incentive fee cap and
deferral mechanism due to net realized and unrealized losses in the portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaling
$17.6 million. 

Administrative fee expense
decreased by $0.1 million, or 14.1%, to $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. Administrative fee expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in expenses incurred by
the Advisor on our behalf for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Professional fees and
general and administrative expenses primarily include legal and audit fees and insurance premiums. These expenses were unchanged
at $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Net realized gains and losses and net unrealized
appreciation and depreciation   

Realized gains or losses
on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments
without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains or losses on investments include
investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments
primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously
recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we realized net losses totaling $2.9 million primarily due to the resolution of two debt investments
partially offset by realized gains on the sale of equity received upon the exercise of warrants. One debt investment was settled
for net cash proceeds of $0.1 million and a royalty and sale agreement fair valued at $0.4 million, which resulted in a realized
loss and unrealized appreciation of $2.2 million. The other debt investment was settled for cash proceeds which resulted in a realized
loss of $1.0 million and unrealized appreciation of $0.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we realized
net losses totaling $1.7 million primarily due to the resolution of one debt investment partially offset by realized gains on the
sale of warrants. The debt investment was settled for a net cash payment of $4.9 million, which resulted in a realized loss of
$1.8 million and unrealized appreciation of $1.8 million as the fair value of the debt investment was adjusted on June 30, 2015
to reflect the outcome of this resolution. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled $14.8 million which was primarily due to the unrealized
depreciation on four debt investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net unrealized appreciation on investments
totaled $1.0 million which was primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on one debt investment
that was settled during the period, as described above, partially offset by changes in fair values of our investment portfolio. 

Liquidity and capital
resources  

As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, we had cash and investments in money market funds of $26.2 million and $21.1 million, respectively.
Cash and investments in money market funds are available to fund new investments, reduce borrowings, pay expenses, repurchase common
stock and pay distributions. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had $1.1 million of restricted investments in money market
funds. Restricted investments in money market funds were primarily used to make monthly interest and principal payments on our
asset-backed notes, or the Asset-Backed Notes. Our primary sources of capital have been from our public and private equity offerings,
use of our revolving credit facilities and issuance of our 7.375% notes due 2019, or the 2019 Notes, and the Asset-Backed Notes. 

On March 24, 2015, we
completed a public offering of 2.0 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $26.5 million, after deducting underwriting
commission and discounts and other offering expenses. We generally used the net proceeds from this offering to make investments,
to repurchase or pay down liabilities and for general corporate purposes. 

On July 29, 2016, our
Board extended a previously authorized stock repurchase program which allows us to repurchase up to $5.0 million of our common
stock at prices below our net asset value per share as reported in our most recent consolidated financial statements. Under the
repurchase program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions from time to time. Any repurchases by us will comply with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 under
the Exchange Act and any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Unless extended by our Board, the repurchase program will terminate
on the earlier of June 30, 2017 or the repurchase of $5.0 million of our common stock. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, we repurchased 1,319 shares of our common stock at an average price of $11.54 on the open market at a total cost of $0.02
million. From the inception of the stock repurchase program through September 30, 2016, we repurchased 114,704 shares of our common
stock at an average price of $11.53 on the open market at a total cost of $1.3 million. 

At September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility, or the Key Facility, with KeyBank
National Association, or Key, was $63.0 million and $68.0 million, respectively. At September 30, 2016, we had borrowing capacity
under the Key Facility of $32.0 million, of which $10.6 million was available, subject to existing terms and advance rates. At
December 31, 2015, we had available borrowing capacity under the Key Facility of $2.0 million, subject to existing terms and
advance rates. 

Our operating activities
provided cash of $36.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and our financing activities used cash of $31.5 million
for the same period. Our operating activities provided cash primarily from principal payments received on our debt investments
partially offset by investments made in portfolio companies. Our financing activities used cash primarily to pay off our Asset-Backed
Notes and pay distributions to our stockholders. 

Our operating activities
used cash of $33.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and our financing activities provided cash of $37.7 million
for the same period. Our operating activities, in such period, used cash primarily for investments made in portfolio companies,
partially offset by principal payments received on our debt investments. Our financing activities, in such period, provided cash
primarily from the completion of a follow-on public offering of 2.0 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $26.5 million,
after deducting underwriting commission and discounts and other offering expenses, and advances on our Key Facility of $42.0 million,
which was partially offset by cash used to pay down our Asset-Backed Notes and pay distributions to our stockholders. 

Our primary use of available
funds is to make debt investments in portfolio companies and for general corporate purposes. We expect to raise additional equity
and debt capital opportunistically as needed and, subject to market conditions, to support our future growth to the extent permitted
by the 1940 Act. 

In order to satisfy the
Code requirements applicable to a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders all or substantially all of our investment company
taxable income. In addition, as a BDC, we are required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%. This requirement limits the
amount that we may borrow. 

We believe that our current
cash, cash generated from operations, and funds available from our Key Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital
and capital expenditure commitments for at least the next 12 months. 

Current borrowings   

The following table shows
our borrowings as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

On August 12, 2015, we
amended the Key Facility to (1) add a $20 million commitment to the existing $50 million commitment and (2) extend the term of
the Key Facility. On April 27, 2016, we further added a $25 million commitment to our existing $70 million commitment. The interest
rate on the Key Facility is based upon the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a spread of 3.25%, with a LIBOR
floor of 0.75%. Based on a LIBOR rate of 0.53% and 0.43% on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the interest
rate was 4.00% as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Key Facility has an
accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total loan commitment to $150 million. The Key Facility is collateralized
by debt investments held by Credit II and permits an advance rate of up to fifty percent (50%) of eligible debt investments held
by Credit II. The Key Facility contains covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum net worth, to restrict
the debt investments securing the Key Facility to certain criteria for qualified debt investments and to comply with portfolio
company concentration limits as defined in the related loan agreement. We may request advances under the Key Facility through
August 12, 2018, or the Revolving Period. After the Revolving Period, we may not request new advances, and we must repay the outstanding
advances under the Key Facility as of such date, at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to maintain compliance with
the terms and conditions of the Key Facility, particularly the condition that the principal balance of the Key Facility not exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate principal balance of our eligible debt investments to our portfolio companies. All outstanding
advances under the Key Facility are due and payable on August 12, 2020. 

On March 23, 2012, we
issued and sold an aggregate principal amount of $30 million 2019 Notes, and on April 18, 2012, pursuant to the underwriters 
30-day option to purchase additional notes, we sold an additional $3 million of the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes will mature on March
15, 2019 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time or from time to time at a redemption price of $25 per
security plus accrued and unpaid interest. The 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.375% per year payable quarterly on March
15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes are our direct, unsecured obligations and (1) rank equally
in right of payment with our future unsecured indebtedness; (2) are senior in right of payment to any of our future indebtedness
that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2019 Notes; (3) are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future
secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security), to the extent
of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and (4) are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness
and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries. A s of  September
30 , 2016, we were in material compliance with the terms of the 2019 Notes.
 The 2019 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  HTF . 

On June 28, 2013, we completed
the 2013-1 Securitization. In connection with the 2013-1 Securitization, 2013-1 Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, issued
$90 million in the Asset-Backed Notes, which were rated A1(sf) by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. The Asset-Backed Notes
were issued by 2013-1 Trust and were backed by a pool of loans made to certain portfolio companies of ours and secured by certain
assets of such portfolio companies. The Asset-Backed Notes were secured obligations of 2013-1 Trust and non-recourse to us. In
connection with the issuance and sale of the Asset-Backed Notes, we made customary representations, warranties and covenants. The
Asset-Backed Notes bore interest at a fixed rate of 3.00% per annum and had a stated maturity of May 15, 2018. As of September
30, 2016 the Asset-Backed Notes were repaid in full. 

Under the terms of the
Asset-Backed Notes, we were required to maintain a reserve cash balance, funded through principal collections from the underlying
securitized debt portfolio, which could have been used to make monthly interest and principal payments on the Asset-Backed Notes. 

As of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, other assets were $2.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, which were primarily comprised
of debt issuance costs and prepaid expenses. 

Contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements   

The following table shows
our significant contractual payment obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016: 

In the normal course of
business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These consist primarily of unfunded commitments to
extend credit, in the form of loans, to our portfolio companies. Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are
not reflected on our balance sheet. Our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time. As of September 30, 2016, we
had unfunded commitments of $7.0 million. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance
requirements as are the financial instruments that we hold on our balance sheet. In addition, these commitments are often subject
to financial or non-financial milestones and other conditions to borrowing that must be achieved before the commitment can be drawn.
Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future
cash requirements. We regularly monitor our unfunded commitments and anticipated refinancings, maturities and capital raising,
to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to fund such unfunded commitments. As of September 30, 2016, we reasonably believed
that our assets would provide adequate financial resources to satisfy all of our unfunded commitments. 

In addition to the Key
Facility, we have certain commitments pursuant to our Investment Management Agreement entered into with our Advisor. We have agreed
to pay a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components (1) a base management fee equal
to a percentage of the value of our gross assets less cash or cash equivalents, and (2) a two-part incentive fee. We have
also entered into a contract with our Advisor to serve as our administrator. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal
to an amount based upon our allocable portion of our Advisor s overhead in performing its obligations under the agreement,
including rent, fees and other expenses inclusive of our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer and
Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information
regarding our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement. 

Distributions   

On October 28,
2016, the Board declared monthly cash distributions of $0.10 per share payable in each of January, February and March 2017,
representing a reduction from the prior rate of $0.115 per month.  

In order to qualify and
be subject to tax as a RIC, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements.
Generally, in order to qualify as a RIC, we must derive at least 90% of our gross income for each tax year from dividends, interest,
payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies,
or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in stock or other securities. We must also meet certain asset
diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of each tax year. Failure to meet these diversification requirements on
the last day of a quarter may result in us having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC
status. Any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices or times, and may cause us to incur substantial losses. 

In addition, in order
to be eligible for the special tax treatment accorded to RICs and to avoid corporate level tax on the income and gains we distribute
to our stockholders in any tax year, we are required under the Code to annually distribute as dividends to our stockholders out
of assets legally available for distribution an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term
capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any. Additionally, in order to avoid the imposition of a U.S. federal
excise tax, we are required to distribute, in respect of each calendar year, dividends to our stockholders of an amount at least
equal to the sum of 98% of our calendar year net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections); 98.2% of
our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one year period ending on October 31 of such calendar
year; and any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding calendar years that were not distributed during such
calendar years and on which we previously paid no U.S. federal income tax. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become
subject to corporate tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available
for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.
In addition, we could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions
in order to re-qualify as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions. 

To the extent our taxable
earnings for a fiscal year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions
may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution
to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should
read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution
is our ordinary income or gains. 

We have adopted an  opt
out  dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders 
cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically
 opts out  of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions
paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes,
stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable
taxes. If our common stock is trading above net asset value, a stockholder receiving distributions in the form of additional shares
of our common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution of an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares of our
common stock. We may use newly issued shares to implement the DRIP, or we may purchase shares in the open market in connection
with our obligations under the DRIP. 

Related party transactions  

We have entered into the
Investment Management Agreement with the Advisor. The Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, as amended. Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor and supervised by the Board, the majority of whom
are independent directors. Under the Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Advisor a base management fee as
well as an incentive fee. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid the Advisor $1.1 million and $2.2
million, respectively, pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
we paid the Advisor $5.8 million and $5.7 million, respectively, pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement. 

Our Advisor is 60% owned
by HTF Holdings LLC, which is 100% owned by Horizon Technology Finance, LLC. By virtue of their ownership interest in Horizon Technology
Finance, LLC, our Chief Executive Officer, Robert D. Pomeroy, Jr. and our President, Gerald A. Michaud, may be deemed to control
our Advisor. 

We have also entered into
the Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator
for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the
Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief
Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration
Agreement the Administrator provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day
operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid the Advisor $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively,
pursuant to the Administration Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid the Advisor $0.8 million
and $0.9 million, respectively, pursuant to the Administration Agreement. 

The predecessor
of the Advisor has granted the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name  Horizon Technology Finance.  

We believe that
we derive substantial benefits from our relationship with our Advisor. Our Advisor may manage other investment vehicles, or  Advisor
Funds,  with the same investment strategy as us. The Advisor may provide us an opportunity to co-invest with the Advisor
Funds. Under the 1940 Act, absent receipt of exemptive relief from the SEC, we and our affiliates are precluded from co-investing
in such investments. Accordingly, we may apply for exemptive relief which would permit us to co-invest subject to certain conditions,
including, without limitation, approval of such investments by both a majority of our directors who have no financial interest
in such transaction and a majority of directors who are not interested persons of us as defined in the 1940 Act. 

Critical accounting policies  

The discussion of our
financial condition and results of operation is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes
in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results
to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated
financial statements. 

We have identified the
following items as critical accounting policies. 

Valuation of investments   

Investments are recorded
at fair value. Our Board determines the fair value of our portfolio investments. We apply fair value to substantially all of our
investments in accordance with GAAP, which establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair
value measurements. We have categorized our investments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique,
into a three-level fair value hierarchy. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant
who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available,
our own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument
at the measurement date. 

The availability of observable
inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the
type of product, whether the product is new, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and
the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable
in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. The three categories within the hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1   
      Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.   

Level 2   
      Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   

Level 3   
      Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.   

Our Board determines the
fair value of investments in good faith, based on the input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms
that have been engaged at the direction of our Board to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily
available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under our valuation policy and a consistently applied
valuation process. The Board conducts this valuation process at the end of each fiscal quarter, with 25% (based on fair value)
of our valuation of portfolio companies that do not have a readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent
valuation firm. 

Income recognition   

Interest on debt investments
is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding. Interest income is determined
using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding. Generally, when a debt investment becomes
90 days or more past due, or if we otherwise do not expect to receive interest and principal repayments, the debt investment
is placed on non-accrual status and the recognition of interest income may be discontinued. Interest payments received on non-accrual
debt investments may be recognized as income, on a cash basis, or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment
at the time the debt investment is placed on non-accrual status. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized
as interest income interest payments of $0.04 million and $0.2 million, respectively, received from one portfolio company whose
debt investment was on non-accrual status. 

We receive a variety of
fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including advisory fees, commitment fees, amendment fees,
non-utilization fees, success fees and prepayment fees. In a limited number of cases, we may also receive a non-refundable deposit
earned upon the termination of a transaction. Debt investment origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred,
and along with unearned income, are amortized as a level yield adjustment over the respective term of the debt investment. All
other income is recorded into income when earned. Fees for counterparty debt investment commitments with multiple debt investments
are allocated to each debt investment based upon each debt investment s relative fair value. When a debt investment is placed
on non-accrual status, the amortization of the related fees and unearned income is discontinued until the debt investment is returned
to accrual status. 

Certain debt investment
agreements also require the borrower to make an ETP that is accrued into income over the life of the debt investment to the extent
such amounts are expected to be collected. We will generally cease accruing the income if there is insufficient value to support
the accrual or if we do not expect the borrower to be able to pay all principal and interest due. 

In connection with substantially
all lending arrangements, we receive warrants to purchase shares of stock from the borrower. We record the warrants as assets at
estimated fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We consider the warrants as loan fees and record
them as unearned income on the grant date. The unearned income is recognized as interest income over the contractual life of the
related debt investment in accordance with our income recognition policy. Subsequent to origination, the warrants are also measured
at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Any adjustment to fair value is recorded through earnings as net unrealized
gain or loss on investments. Gains and losses from the disposition of the warrants or stock acquired from the exercise of warrants
are recognized as realized gains and losses on investments. 

Realized gains or losses
on the sale of investments, or upon the determination that an investment balance, or portion thereof, is not recoverable, are calculated
using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses by calculating the difference between the net proceeds
from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation
reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously
recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 

Income taxes   

We have elected to be
treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs.
In order to qualify as a RIC and to avoid corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on the income distributed to stockholders, among
other things, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, and we must timely distribute
dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of
our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid,
for each tax year. We, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders,
which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes. 

Depending on the level
of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into
the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current
year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions, we will accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated
excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. 

We evaluate tax positions
taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not 
to be sustained by the applicable tax authority in accordance with Topic 740, as modified by Topic 946, of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board s, or FASB s, Accounting Standards Codification, as amended. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to
meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, or uncertain tax positions, are recorded as a tax expense in the current year. It is our
policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. We had no material
uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Recently adopted accounting pronouncement   

In April 2015, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  or ASU 2015-03, as clarified by ASU 2015-15,  Interest Imputation of Interest:
Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements , or ASU 2015-15, 
 containing guidance that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, instead of being recorded as a separate asset. ASU
2015-15 allows an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently
amortize these deferred costs over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. We have adopted ASU 2015-03, as clarified by ASU
2015-15, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements other than corresponding reductions to total
assets and total liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Prior to adoption, we recorded debt issuance
costs in other assets as an asset on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Upon adoption, we reclassified these
costs as unamortized debt issuance costs that reduce debt in the liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities
and retrospectively reclassified the debt issuance costs that were previously presented in other assets as an asset as of December
31, 2015. 

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk   

We are subject to financial
market risks, including changes in interest rates. During the periods covered by our financial statements, the interest rates on
the debt investments within our portfolio were primarily at floating rates. 
We expect that our debt investments in the future will primarily have floating interest rates. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, 97% and 93%, respectively, of the outstanding principal amount of our debt investments bore interest at floating rates.
The initial commitments to lend to our portfolio companies are usually based on a floating LIBOR index. 

Based on our September
30, 2016 consolidated statement of assets and liabilities (without adjustment for potential changes in the credit market, credit
quality, size and composition of assets on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities or other business developments
that could affect net income), the following table shows the annual impact on the change in net assets resulting from operations
of changes in interest rates, which assumes no changes in our investments and borrowings: 

(1)    Excludes the impact of
incentive fees based on pre-incentive fee net investment income.  

While our 2019 Notes bear
interest at a fixed rate, our Key Facility has a floating interest rate provision, subject to a floor of 0.75%, based on a LIBOR
index which resets daily, and any other credit facilities into which we enter in the future may have floating interest rate provisions.
We have used hedging instruments in the past to protect us against interest rate fluctuations, and we may use them in the future.
Such instruments may include caps, swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against
adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with
respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates. 

Because we currently fund,
and expect to continue to fund, our investments with borrowings, our net income is dependent upon the difference between the rate
at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant
change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net income. In periods of rising interest rates,
our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income. 

Item 4.     Controls and Procedures   

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   

As of September 30, 2016,
we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Finance and Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Finance and Interim Chief
Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Finance and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of such possible controls and procedures. 

(b) Changes in internal controls
over financial reporting.   

There have been no material
changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during our most recently completed fiscal quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II  

Item 1: Legal Proceedings.  

Neither we nor our Advisor
is currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against
us or against our Advisor. 

Item 1A: Risk Factors.  

In addition to other information
set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the  Risk Factors  discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect
our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 to the risk factors set forth in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. 

Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.  

The following table provides
information regarding our purchases of our common stock for each month in the three month period ended September 30, 2016: 

(1)    On September 28, 2015,
we announced a share repurchase plan which allows us to repurchase up to $5.0 million of our outstanding common stock. The plan
was extended by the Board on July 29, 2016 and will expire on the earlier of June 30, 2017 and the repurchase of $5.0 million
of common stock.  

Item 3: Defaults Upon Senior Securities.  

None. 

Item 4: Mine Safety Disclosures.  

Not applicable 

Item 5: Other Information.  

None.
