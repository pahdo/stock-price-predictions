Our operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2016 were $46,218 compared to $31,891 as of September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses was primarily as a result of an increase in professional fees..      Liquidity and Financial Condition       Working Capital             Cash Flows                        7       
      Table of Contents          Our total current liabilities as of September 30, 2016 were $33,369 as compared to total current liabilities of $25,905 as of September 30, 2016.

Operating Activities      Net cash used in operating activities was $50,936 for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared with net cash used in operating activities of $24,685 in the same period in 2015.

Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital      There is no historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance.  We have generated no revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in developing our website, and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services.     At present, we do not have enough cash on hand to cover operating costs for the next 12 months.     If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either our operations, or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations.     We have no plans to undertake any product research and development during the next twelve months.  There are also no plans or expectations to acquire or sell any plant or plant equipment in the first year of operations.

We do not have sufficient funds to operate for the next twelve months. We have to issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party in order to finance our operations. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources.                  8       
      Table of Contents           Contractual Obligations      As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.      Going Concern      As of September 30, 2016, our company had a net loss of $46,218 and has earned no revenues. Our company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending September 30, 2017. The ability of our company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of our business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.      Critical Accounting Policies       We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in our financial statements.     While we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements       Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. The Company's management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our company's financial statements.       Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.                       9

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Bally, Corp. as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders  equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bally, Corp. as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in conformity with accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has not generated any revenues since inception, has a net loss of $46,218, and an accumulated deficit of $145,623 at September 30, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.          /S/ Paritz   Company, P.A.

      Table of Contents           BALLY, CORP.     Notes to the Financial Statements     For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS      BALLY, CORP. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 13, 2013 and it is based in Mehlon, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.  The Company intends to operate as an ecommerce hardware store.  To date, the Company s activities have been limited to its formation and the raising of equity capital.       NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of Presentation       The Financial Statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  The Financial Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) of the United States.        Use of estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value.         Financial Instruments       The Company follows ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).                  F-6       
      Table of Contents          The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:      Level 1      Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.      Level 2      Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.      Level 3      Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.     The fair value of accrued expenses and due to shareholder approximates their carrying amounts because of their immediate or short term maturity.       Concentrations of Credit Risks       The Company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and related party payables it will likely incur in the near future.  The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness.  At times, its cash with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits.  The Company s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.       Share-based Expenses       ASC 718  Compensation   Stock Compensation  prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).                  F-7       
      Table of Contents          The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50,   Equity   Based Payments to Non-Employees.   Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued.  The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.       During the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized no share-based expenses, respectively.       Income Taxes       The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.       Loss per Share       The Company has adopted ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share,  ( EPS ) which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures, and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation.  In the accompanying financial statements, basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.     The Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of its financial statements. The Company's management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.      NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated any revenues since inception. For the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company has a net loss of $46,218 and an accumulated deficit of $145,623 at September 30, 2016. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.                  F-8       
      Table of Contents          The continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to continue to raise adequate financing and to commence profitable operations in the future and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations as they become due.        NOTE 4 - INCOME TAXES      The Company follows ASC 740. Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of (a) temporary difference between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes, and (b) net operating loss carry-forwards. No net provision for refundable Federal income tax has been made in the accompanying statement of loss because no recoverable taxes were paid previously. Similarly, no deferred tax asset attributable to the net operating loss carry-forward has been recognized, as it is not deemed likely to be realized.     The provisions for refundable federal income tax at 34% for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consist of the following:           The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company s net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2014 are as follows:                        F-9       
      Table of Contents          The Company has approximately $145,623 of net operating losses ( NOL ) carried forward to offset taxable income in future years which expire commencing in fiscal 2032. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.      NOTE 5 - SHAREHOLDER S EQUITY        Authorized Stock       The Company has authorized 100,000,000 common shares and 20,000,000 preferred shares, both with a par value of $0.0001 per share.  Each common share entitles the holder to one vote, in person or proxy, on any matter on which action of the stockholders of the corporation is sought.       Preferred Share Issuances       There were no preferred shares issued from inception March 13, 2013 to September 30, 2016.       Common Share Issuances       During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued no common share.     During the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued common shares as follow;           As of September 30, 2016, and 2015, the Company has 9,850,000 common shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively.             NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTIES TRANSACTIONS      In support of the Company s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing.  There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders or directors.  Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities.  The advances were considered temporary in nature and were not formalized by a promissory note.     During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company's sole officer advanced to the Company an amount of $24,381 by the way of loan. As at September 30, 2016, the Company was obligated to the officer, for an unsecured, non-interest bearing demand loan with a balance of $24,381.     During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company's previous shareholders assumed debt of $16,655 which was recorded as additional paid in capital.     During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company's prior sole officer advanced to the Company an amount of $9,900 by the way of loan and a total of non-interest bearing demand loan of $22,099 was forgiven by a former officer, which was recorded as additional paid in capital. During the year ended September 30, 2015, the Company s prior sole officer advanced to the Company an amount of $11,000 by way of loan.  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company was obligated to the officers for an unsecured, non-interest bearing demand loan with a balance of $0 and $12,199.     As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company owed related party $24,381 and $12,199, respectively.      NOTE 7 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued.  Based on our evaluation no material events have occurred that require disclosure.               Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure       None.       Item 9A. Controls and Procedures        Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures      Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Evaluation Date"). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure       Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. With the participation of our chief executive officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control   Integrated Framework. Based upon such evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on the COSO framework criteria, as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.     The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management dominated by a single individual without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2016.     Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.     This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for non-accelerated filers from the internal control audit requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.      Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2016 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.       Item 9B. Other Information       None.             PART III         Item 10.

Our company believes that Mr. Chun's professional background experience gives him the qualifications and skills necessary to serve as a director and officer of our company.      Employment Agreements      We have no formal employment agreements with any of our directors or officers.       Family Relationships      There are no family relationships between any of our directors, executive officers and proposed directors or executive officers.

Compliance with Section 16(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934      Our common stock is not registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Accordingly, our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities are not subject to the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Section 16(1) of the Exchange Act.      Code of Ethics      We have not adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.             Board and Committee Meetings      Our board of directors held no formal meetings during the year ended September 30, 2016. All proceedings of the board of directors were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented to in writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the directors are, according to the Nevada General Corporate Law and our Bylaws, as valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly called and held.      Nomination Process      As of September 30, 2016, we did not effect any material changes to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. Our board of directors does not have a policy with regards to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. Our board of directors has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate our company s requirements as well as the qualifications of each candidate when the board considers a nominee for a position on our board of directors. If shareholders wish to recommend candidates directly to our board, they may do so by sending communications to the president of our company at the address on the cover of this annual report.      Audit Committee      Currently our audit committee consists of our entire board of directors. We do not have a standing audit committee as we currently have limited working capital and no revenues. Should we be able to raise sufficient funding to execute our business plan, we will form an audit, compensation committee and other applicable committees utilizing our directors  expertise.      Audit Committee Financial Expert      Currently our audit committee consists of our entire board of directors. We do not currently have a director who is qualified to act as the head of the audit committee.        Item 11.

(2)  Mr. Chun has held the positions of Chief Executive Officer (CEO), President and Secretary since June 24, 2016.         There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. Our directors and executive officers may receive share options at the discretion of our board of directors in the future. We do not have any material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that share options may be granted at the discretion of our board of directors.       Grants of Plan-Based Awards      During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 we did not grant any stock options.      Option Exercises and Stock Vested       During our fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 there were no options exercised by our named officers.       Compensation of Directors      We do not have any agreements for compensating our directors for their services in their capacity as directors, although such directors are expected in the future to receive stock options to purchase shares of our common stock as awarded by our board of directors.              Pension, Retirement or Similar Benefit Plans      There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. We have no material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except that stock options may be granted at the discretion of the board of directors or a committee thereof.       Indebtedness of Directors, Senior Officers, Executive Officers and Other Management      None of our directors or executive officers or any associate or affiliate of our company during the last two fiscal years, is or has been indebted to our company by way of guarantee, support agreement, letter of credit or other similar agreement or understanding currently outstanding.        Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters       The following table sets forth, as of December 23, 2016, certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common shares by each shareholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common shares, as well as by each of our current directors and executive officers as a group. Each person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated. Beneficial ownership consists of a direct interest in the shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated.        ________         (1)  Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on December 23, 2016. As of December 23, 2016 there were 9,850,000 shares of our company s common stock issued and outstanding.                Changes in Control      We are unaware of any contract or other arrangement or provisions of our Articles or Bylaws the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change of control of our company. There are not any provisions in our Articles or Bylaws, the operation of which would delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of our company.       Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence       Except as disclosed herein, no director, executive officer, shareholder holding at least 5% of shares of our common stock, or any family member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, or proposed transaction since the year ended September 30, 2016, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at the year-end for the last three completed fiscal years.       Director Independence      We currently act with one director, Lung Ming Chun.     We have determined we do not have an independent director, as that term is used in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Rules of National Association of Securities Dealers.      Currently our audit committee consists of our entire board of directors. We currently do not have nominating, compensation committees or committees performing similar functions. There has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors.     From inception to present date, we believe that the members of our audit committee and the board of directors have been and are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.       Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services       The aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and for fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:            Our board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.     Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors  independence.             PART IV         Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules                     (a)  Financial Statements                              (1)   Financial statements for our company are listed in the index under Item 8 of this document.
