      Table of Contents          These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.       Foreign Currency Translation and Re-measurement       The Company translates its foreign operations to U.S. dollar in accordance with ASC 830,   Foreign Currency Matters  .     The Company and its subsidiaries' functional currency and reporting currency is U.S. dollar, except Amuli and Tieshan Oil s functional currency which is Chinese Renminbi ( RMB ).     The Company's subsidiaries, whose records are not maintained in that company's functional currency, re-measure their records into their functional currency as follows:                      Monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period                          Nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates                          Revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period         Gains and losses from these re-measurements were not significant and have been included in the Company's results of operations.     The Company's subsidiaries, whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, translate their records into U.S. dollar as follows:                      Assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date                          Equities at historical rate                          Revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period         Adjustments arising from such translations are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders  equity.             Concentrations of Credit Risk       Cash includes cash at banks and demand deposits in accounts maintained with banks within the PRC. Total cash in these banks as of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016 amounted to $36,588 and $226,638, respectively, none of which is covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks to its cash in bank accounts.                 8       
      Table of Contents          The Company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The Company also reviews its accounts receivable on a timely manner. The Company s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.      Tieshan Oil      During the nine-month period ended October 31, 2016, one customer accounted for approximately 51% of revenues of Tieshan Oil. During the year ended January 31, 2016, one customer accounted for approximately 80% of revenues of Tieshan Oil.     As of October 31, 2016, two customers accounted for approximately 86% of accounts receivable. As of January 31, 2016, two customers accounted for approximately 90% of accounts receivable. There was no significant changes of such concentrations of credit risk between October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016.       Use of Estimates       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.       Financial Instruments       The Company follows ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures", which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).     The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:      Level 1      Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.      Level 2      Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.      Level 3      Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.                 9       
      Table of Contents            Property, plant and equipment       Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. The useful lives are as follows:           Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Expenditures which substantially increase the useful lives of the related assets are capitalized. When properties are disposed of, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reported in the period the transaction takes place.       Investments in Companies Accounted for Using the Equity or Cost Method       In accordance with ASC 320-10,   Investments   Debit and Equity Securities,   investments in other non-consolidated entities are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and/or the Company's ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. When the equity method is used, investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize the Company's proportionate share of the investees' net income or losses after the date of investment. When net losses from an investment accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying amount, the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional losses are not provided for as the Company is not obligated to provide additional capital. The Company resumes accounting for the investment under the equity method if the entity subsequently reports net income and the Company's share of that net income exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended.     When an investment accounted for using the equity method issues its own shares, the subsequent reduction in the Company's proportionate interest in the investee is reflected in equity as an adjustment to paid-in-capital. The Company evaluates its investments in companies accounted for by the equity or cost method for impairment when there is evidence or indicators that a decrease in value may be other than temporary.       Goodwill       The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount. If the Company does not perform a qualitative assessment or if the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, the Company calculates the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value. During the nine months ended October 31, 2016, no impairment is considered to be required for goodwill. During the year ended January 31, 2016, $4,005,224 goodwill on Amuli was considered fully impaired and written off by the Company.       Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets       The long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology or other industry changes. Determination of recoverability of assets to be held and used is by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. During the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and the year ended January 31, 2016, the Company did not impair any long-lived assets except goodwill on Amuli mentioned above.             Revenue Recognition       The Company will recognize revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition.  Revenue will be recognized only when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence for an agreement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, the price or fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.       Deferred Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance       The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740,   Income Taxes.   Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as at October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016.       Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock       The Company has adopted ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share,   ( EPS ) which requires presentation of basic EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.     The Company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding.       Commitments and Contingencies       The Company follows ASC 450-20,   Loss Contingencies,   to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. There were no commitments or contingencies as of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       In May 2014 and again in August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended accounting guidance on revenue recognition that will be applied to all contracts with customers. The objective of the new guidance is to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities and to provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2019. Early adoption is permitted, but only beginning in 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.     Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. The Company's management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.      NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN      The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet had sufficient revenues to cover its operating cost, and requires additional capital to commence its operating plan. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.           In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan to obtain such resources for the Company include: sales of equity instruments; traditional financing, such as loans; and obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.     There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability.

The acquisition was closed on March 20, 2015.     This investment was accounted for under equity method initially with cost of $2,000,000. During March 20, 2015 to April 30, 2015, the Company recognized $30,692 loss from its investment in Worx based on its proportionate share of Worx s net loss during March 20, 2015 to April 30, 2015.

All references in this Form 10-Q to the "Company," "Resort Savers," "we," "us," or "our" are to Resort Savers, Inc.       Corporate Overview      Resort Savers, Inc. (the  Company  or  Resort Savers  or  RSSV ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 25, 2012.  The Company was authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share.

During the year ended January 31, 2016, the Company issued the following shares:             Worx America, Inc.       From January 2015 through March 2015, the Company, by and through its wholly owned subsidiary, Xing Rui International Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd., a Seychelles corporation ( Xing Rui ), acquired 20,068,750 common shares of Worx America, Inc. ( Worx ), a private company based in Houston, Texas, in exchange for $1,650,000 cash and 1,000,000 shares of common stock of BRI with a value of $350,000 were paid by the Company to Worx in exchange of 20,068,750 common shares of Worx, representing 20% of Worx's the then issued and outstanding voting common stock on a fully converted and diluted basis.  More specifically, (i) on January 28, 2015, $350,000 cash was paid by the Company to Worx in exchange of 5,403,728 common shares of Worx and (ii) on March 20, 2015, $1,300,000 cash and 1,000,000 shares of common stock of BRI with a value of $350,000 were paid by the Company to Worx in exchange of 14,665,022 common shares of Worx. This investment was accounted for under equity method with initial cost of $2,000,000.           Prior to June 6, 2016, Worx designed automated solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries to improve efficiency and systems output.  The Worx automated robotic tank cleaning system reduced tank cleaning time, reduced or eliminated the need for personnel to enter tanks, and attempted to reduce the volume of solvents used to clean a tank. Actual results varied from tank to tank and involved variables including the product in the tank, physical condition of the tank such as corrosion, or amount of sludge accumulated. Prior to June 6, 2016, Worx was refining its product line to improve speed and efficiency.  Our investment in Worx had facilitated such development. We had hoped that our investment into what we believed was an important technology would give us early access to the technology, establish relationships in the industry, and allow us to assist Worx with the launch of its commercial products in China and other parts of Asia. However, on June 6, 2016, Worx sold all of its assets ( Asset Sale ), including, but not limited to, its technologies and intellectual property, to Bay WorxRail, LLC ( Bay WorxRail ) for $1,000,000 ( Purchase Price ), subject to a holdback of $250,000 of the Purchase Price, pursuant to the terms set forth in that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated June 6, 2016, among Worx, Bay WorxRail, and Michael Zilai, as majority stockholder of Worx. The Asset Sale by Worx resulted in the full impairment of our investment in Worx at the end of our second fiscal quarter of 2016.       Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd.

BYTOC is principally engaged in the trading of oil, gas and lubricant products within the PRC.

Under the Exchange Agreement, Mr. Baojin guarantees, for five years, that BYTOC will have an annual net income of Renminbi (the currency of the PRC    RMB ) 10 million.
