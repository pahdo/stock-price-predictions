Item 1. 
 Financial Statements      The interim consolidated financial statements contained herein reflect
all adjustments (all of a normal, recurring nature) which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders  equity for the periods
presented. They have been prepared in accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X and do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. Operating results for the
thirty nine weeks ended September 24, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.  
 These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 (Unaudited)    The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Landstar System, Inc. and its subsidiary, Landstar System Holdings, Inc., and reflect all adjustments (all of a normal, recurring nature) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair
statement of the results for the periods presented. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of management s estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Landstar System, Inc. and its
subsidiary are herein referred to as  Landstar  or the  Company.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. Significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated in
consolidation.      

(1)  
  Share-based Payment Arrangements       As of September 24, 2016, the Company had two employee
equity incentive plans, the 2002 employee stock option and stock incentive plan (the  ESOSIP ) and the 2011 equity incentive plan (the  2011 EIP ). No further grants can be made under the ESOSIP. The Company also has a stock
compensation plan for members of its Board of Directors, the Amended and Restated 2013 Directors Stock Compensation Plan (as amended and restated as of May 17, 2016, the  2013 DSCP ). 6,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock
were authorized for issuance under the 2011 EIP and 115,000 shares of the Company s common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2013 DSCP. The ESOSIP, 2011 EIP and 2013 DSCP are each referred to herein as a  Plan,  and,
collectively, as the  Plans.  Amounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to these Plans are as follows (in thousands):      
   Included in income tax benefits recognized in the thirty-nine-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and
September 26, 2015 were income tax benefits of $261,000 and $348,000, respectively, recognized on disqualifying dispositions of the Company s common stock by employees who obtained shares of common stock through exercises of incentive stock
options.    As of September 24, 2016, there were 86,572 shares of the Company s common stock reserved for issuance under the 2013 DSCP
and 5,159,100 shares of the Company s common stock reserved for issuance in the aggregate under the ESOSIP and 2011 EIP.     Restricted Stock Units
    The following table summarizes information regarding the Company s outstanding restricted stock unit ( RSU ) awards
under the Plans:      
   During the thirty-nine-week period ended September 24, 2016, the Company granted RSUs with a performance
condition. RSUs with a performance condition granted on January 29, 2016 may vest on January 31 of 2019, 2020 and 2021 based on growth in operating  
      9  

Table of Contents  

income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as compared to the results from the 2015 fiscal year. Outstanding RSUs at both December 26, 2015 and September 24, 2016 include
RSUs with a performance condition and RSUs with a market condition, as further described below.   RSUs with a performance condition vest
over a 5 year period from the date of grant based on growth in operating income and diluted earnings per share as compared to a base year, being the year immediately preceding the year of grant. At the time of grant, the target number of common
shares available for issuance under the January 29, 2016 and January 27, 2015 grants equals 100% of the number of RSUs granted, and the maximum number of common shares available for issuance under the January 29, 2016 and January 27, 2015
grants equals 200% of the number of RSUs granted. In the event actual results exceed the target, the number of shares that will be granted will exceed the number of RSUs granted. The maximum number of common shares available for issuance under
grants made prior to 2015 equals 100% of the number of RSUs granted. The fair value of an RSU with a performance condition was determined based on the market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, discounted for lack of
marketability for a minimum post-vesting holding requirement. The discount rate due to lack of marketability used for RSU award grants with a performance condition for all periods was 7%. With respect to RSU awards with a performance condition, the
Company reports compensation expense over the life of the award based on an estimated number of units that will vest over the life of the award, multiplied by the fair value of an RSU.  
 On May 1, 2015, the Company granted 20,000 RSUs that vest based on a market condition. These RSUs may vest on April 30 of 2019, 2020 and
2021 based on the Company s total shareholder return ( TSR ) compound annual growth rate over the vesting periods, adjusted to reflect dividends (if any) paid during such periods and capital adjustments as may be necessary. The target
number of common shares available for issuance under the May 1, 2015 grant equals 100% of the number of RSUs granted, and the maximum number of common shares available for issuance under the May 1, 2015 grant equals 150% of the number of RSUs
granted. In the event actual results exceed the target TSR compound annual growth rate, the number of shares that will be granted will exceed the number of RSUs granted. The fair value of this RSU award was determined at the time of grant based on
the expected achievement of the market condition at the end of each vesting period. With respect to these RSU awards with a market condition, compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period under an award based on the
fair market value of the award at the time of grant, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. Previously recognized compensation cost would be reversed, however, if the employee terminated employment prior to completing such
requisite service period.    The Company recognized approximately $1,322,000 and $3,446,000 of share-based compensation expense related to
RSU awards in the thirty-nine-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, respectively. As of September 24, 2016, there was a maximum of $26.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSU awards granted under
the Plans with an expected average remaining life of approximately 2.9 years. With respect to RSU awards with a performance condition, the amount of future compensation expense to be recognized will be determined based on future operating
results.     Stock Options     The
following table summarizes information regarding the Company s outstanding stock options under the Plans:      
   The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the thirty-nine-week periods ended September 24,
2016 and September 26, 2015 was $1,938,000 and $2,542,000, respectively.    As of September 24, 2016, there was $600,000 of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted under the Plans. The unrecognized compensation cost related to these non-vested options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.0 year.

Table of Contents  

   Non-vested Restricted Stock   
 The following table summarizes information regarding the Company s outstanding shares of non-vested restricted stock under the Plans:  
   
   The fair value of each share of non-vested restricted stock issued under the Plans is based on the fair value
of a share of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. Shares of non-vested restricted stock are generally subject to vesting in three equal annual installments or 100% on the first, third or fifth anniversary of the date of the
grant.   As of September 24, 2016, there was $1,228,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested shares of restricted
stock granted under the Plans. The unrecognized compensation cost related to these non-vested shares of restricted stock is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.  

(2)  
  Income Taxes       The provisions for income taxes for the 2016 and 2015 thirty-nine-week
periods were based on estimated annual effective income tax rates of 38.1% and 38.2%, respectively, adjusted for discrete events, such as benefits resulting from disqualifying dispositions of the Company s common stock by employees who obtained
the stock through exercises of incentive stock options. The effective income tax rates for the 2016 and 2015 thirty-nine-week periods were 37.6% and 37.9%, respectively, which were higher than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily as a
result of state taxes, the meals and entertainment exclusion and non-deductible stock-based compensation.    During the first fiscal quarter
of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-17   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ), which requires an entity to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a
classified balance sheet. The Company reclassified $6,552,000 of current deferred tax assets to noncurrent to conform to the current year presentation and this amount is now included in deferred income taxes and other noncurrent liabilities in the
December 26, 2015 consolidated balance sheet.      

(3)  
  Earnings Per Share       Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number
of shares outstanding, including outstanding non-vested restricted stock. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the incremental shares that would have been outstanding upon the assumed
exercise of all dilutive stock options.    The following table provides a reconciliation of the average number of common shares outstanding
used to calculate earnings per common share to the average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share (in thousands):  

11  

Table of Contents  

  For each of the thirty-nine-week and thirteen-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and September
26, 2015, no options outstanding to purchase shares of common stock were antidilutive. Outstanding RSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all periods because the performance metric requirements or market condition
for vesting had not been satisfied.      

(4)  
  Additional Cash Flow Information       During the 2016 thirty-nine-week period, Landstar paid
income taxes and interest of $48,615,000 and $2,730,000, respectively. During the 2015 thirty-nine-week period, Landstar paid income taxes and interest of $50,197,000 and $2,252,000, respectively. Landstar acquired operating property by entering
into capital leases in the amount of $46,456,000 and $11,869,000 in the 2016 and 2015 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. In addition, Landstar acquired $3,237,000 of operating property for which the Company accrued a corresponding liability in
accounts payable as of September 24, 2016 related to the construction in process of a freight staging and transload facility in Laredo, TX. Approximately $5,440,000 of the $112,654,000 of purchases of common stock during the 2015 thirty-nine-week
period was accrued at September 26, 2015 and settled in the subsequent fiscal month.      

(5)  
  Segment Information       The following table summarizes information about the Company s
reportable business segments as of and for the thirty-nine-week and thirteen-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 (in thousands):      
     
   In the thirty-nine and thirteen-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, no single
customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company s consolidated revenue.      

(6)  
  Other Comprehensive Income       The following table presents the components of and changes
in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related income taxes, as of and for the thirty-nine-week period ended September 24, 2016 (in thousands):      
 
      12  

Table of Contents  

  Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to investment income due to the
realization of previously unrealized gains and losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income were not significant for the thirty-nine-week period ended September 24, 2016.  

(7)  
  Investments       Investments include primarily investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S.
Treasury obligations having maturities of up to five years (the  bond portfolio ). Investments in the bond portfolio are reported as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Investments maturing less than one year from the balance
sheet date are included in short-term investments and investments maturing more than one year from the balance sheet date are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Management performs an analysis of the nature of the
unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments to determine whether such losses are other-than-temporary. Unrealized losses, representing the excess of the purchase price of an investment over its fair value as of the end of a period,
considered to be other-than-temporary, are to be included as a charge in the statement of income, while unrealized losses considered to be temporary are to be included as a component of shareholders  equity. Investments whose values are based
on quoted market prices in active markets are classified within Level 1. Investments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market prices, are classified within Level 2. As Level 2 investments
include positions that are not traded in active markets, valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, which are generally based on available market information. Any transfers between levels are recognized as of the
beginning of any reporting period. Fair value of the bond portfolio was determined using Level 1 inputs related to U.S. Treasury obligations and money market investments and Level 2 inputs related to investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed
securities and direct obligations of government agencies. Unrealized gains, net of unrealized losses, on the investments in the bond portfolio were $416,000 at September 24, 2016, while unrealized losses, net of unrealized gains, on the investments
in the bond portfolio were $145,000 at December 26, 2015.    The amortized cost and fair values of available-for-sale investments are as
follows at September 24, 2016 and December 26, 2015 (in thousands):      
 
      13  

Table of Contents  

  For those available-for-sale investments with unrealized losses at September 24, 2016 and
December 26, 2015, the following table summarizes the duration of the unrealized loss (in thousands):      
   The Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis of these securities as it does not intend to sell, and
does not anticipate being required to sell, these securities before recovery of the cost basis. For these reasons, the Company does not consider the unrealized losses on these securities to be other-than-temporary at September 24, 2016.  

(8)  
  Commitments and Contingencies       Short-term investments include $56,679,000 in current
maturities of investments held by the Company s insurance segment at September 24, 2016. The non-current portion of the bond portfolio of $53,002,000 is included in other assets. The short-term investments, together with $11,221,000 of
non-current investments, provide collateral for the $61,110,000 of letters of credit issued to guarantee payment of insurance claims. As of September 24, 2016, Landstar also had $35,601,000 of additional letters of credit outstanding under the
Company s Credit Agreement.    The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of
business. Many of these claims are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with
respect to the resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, but could have a material effect on the
results of operations in a given quarter or year.      

(9)  
  Change in Accounting Estimate for Self-Insured Claims       Landstar provides for the
estimated costs of self-insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis. The amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date. The ultimate resolution
of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management. The Company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each
claim. Historically, the Company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior years  claims estimates.  
 The following table summarizes the effect of the increase in the cost of insurance claims resulting from unfavorable (favorable) development
of prior year self-insured claims estimates on operating income, net income and earnings per share amounts in the consolidated statements of income for the thirty-nine-week and thirteen-week periods ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015
(in thousands, except per share amounts):

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements       In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.
On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved deferring the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The FASB also approved permitting early adoption of the standard, but not before the original
effective date of December 15, 2016. ASU 2014-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.    In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The Company adopted this guidance during the first fiscal quarter of 2016 and applied it retrospectively. Deferred tax assets in the prior period
presented have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. See Note 2, Income Taxes, for further information.    In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02   Leases ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires a company to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments measured at
the present value of the lease payments for all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Companies are required to use a modified retrospective transition approach to recognize leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. ASU
2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein, and early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity
or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. The impact of adopting this standard on our financial statements will
be dependent on the timing and intrinsic value of future share-based compensation award vesting and exercises.    In June 2016, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13 ), which requires measurement and recognition of expected versus
incurred credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its financial statements.

 Landstar System, Inc. and its subsidiary, Landstar System Holdings, Inc. (together, referred to herein as  Landstar  or the
 Company ), is a worldwide asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions. The Company offers services to its customers across multiple transportation modes, with the ability to arrange for individual shipments of
freight to enterprise-wide solutions to manage all of a customer s transportation needs. Landstar provides services principally throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada, and between the United States and Canada, Mexico and
other countries around the world. The Company s services emphasize safety, information coordination and customer service and are delivered through a network of independent commission sales agents and third party capacity providers linked
together by a series of technological applications which are provided and coordinated by the Company. The nature of the Company s business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue.  
 Landstar markets its integrated transportation management solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively
utilizes third party capacity providers to transport customers  freight. Landstar s independent commission sales agents enter into contractual arrangements with the Company and are responsible for locating freight, making that freight
available to Landstar s capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers. The Company s third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity
to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements (the  BCO Independent Contractors ), unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the Company under non-exclusive contractual arrangements (the  Truck Brokerage
Carriers ), air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and railroads. Through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by Landstar s information technology systems, Landstar operates an integrated transportation
management solutions business primarily throughout North America with revenue of $3.3 billion during the most recently completed fiscal year. The Company reports the results of two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the
insurance segment.    The transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of integrated transportation management
solutions. Transportation services offered by the Company include truckload and less-than-truckload transportation, rail intermodal, air cargo, ocean cargo, expedited ground and air delivery of time-critical freight, heavy-haul/specialized,
U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico cross-border, project cargo and customs brokerage. Industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive products, building products, metals, chemicals, foodstuffs, heavy machinery, retail,
electronics, ammunition and explosives and military equipment. In addition, the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies, including third party logistics and less-than-truckload service
providers. Each of the independent commission sales agents has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment. Billings for freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per
shipment basis for the physical transportation of freight and are referred to as transportation revenue. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 24, 2016, revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers and railroads
represented approximately 48%, 45% and 3%, respectively, of the Company s consolidated revenue. Collectively, revenue hauled by air and ocean cargo carriers represented approximately 2% of the Company s consolidated revenue in the
thirty-nine-week period ended September 24, 2016.    The insurance segment is comprised of Signature Insurance Company, a wholly owned
offshore insurance subsidiary ( Signature ), and Risk Management Claim Services, Inc. This segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of Landstar s operating subsidiaries. In addition, it reinsures certain risks
of the Company s BCO Independent Contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to certain of Landstar s operating subsidiaries. Revenue at the insurance segment represents reinsurance premiums from third
party insurance companies that provide insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors where all or a portion of the risk is ultimately borne by Signature. Revenue at the insurance segment represented approximately 2% of the Company s
consolidated revenue for the thirty-nine-week period ended September 24, 2016.

   Changes in Financial Condition and Results of Operations   
 Management believes the Company s success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent
commission sales agents and to safely and efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers. Management believes the most significant factors to the Company s success include increasing revenue, sourcing capacity and
controlling costs, including insurance and claims.    While customer demand, which is subject to overall economic conditions, ultimately
drives increases or decreases in revenue, the Company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities. Management s emphasis with respect to revenue growth is on
revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate $1 million or more of Landstar revenue ( Million Dollar Agents ). Management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to
increase both the revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents and the number of Million Dollar Agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents.
During the 2015 fiscal year, 512 independent commission sales agents generated $1 million or more of Landstar revenue and thus qualified as Million Dollar Agents. During the 2015 fiscal year, the average revenue generated by a Million Dollar Agent
was $5,998,000 and revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents in the aggregate represented 92% of consolidated revenue.   Management
monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads (volume) and revenue per load by mode of transportation. Revenue per load can be influenced by many factors other than a change in price. Those factors include the average length of haul,
freight type, special handling and equipment requirements, fuel costs and delivery time requirements. For shipments involving two or more modes of transportation, revenue is generally classified by the mode of transportation having the highest
cost for the load. The following table summarizes this information by trailer type for truck transportation and by mode for all others:      

(1)    
   Includes primarily reinsurance premium revenue generated by the insurance segment.    
      17  

Table of Contents  

  Also critical to the Company s success is its ability to secure capacity, particularly truck
capacity, at rates that allow the Company to profitably transport customers  freight. The following table summarizes the number of available truck capacity providers on the dates indicated:  

(1)   
 Active refers to Truck Brokerage Carriers who moved at least one load in the 180 days immediately preceding the fiscal quarter end.    
 The Company incurs costs that are directly related to the transportation of freight that include purchased transportation and commissions to
agents. The Company incurs indirect costs associated with the transportation of freight that include other operating costs and insurance and claims. In addition, the Company incurs selling, general and administrative costs essential to administering
its business operations. Management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the Company and establishes annual cost budgets which, in general, are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis.  
 Purchased transportation represents the amount a BCO Independent Contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight.
The amount of purchased transportation paid to a BCO Independent Contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed-upon percentage of revenue generated by loads hauled by the BCO Independent Contractor. Purchased transportation paid to a Truck
Brokerage Carrier is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or, to a lesser extent, a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. Purchased transportation paid to railroads is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled
or a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate. Purchased transportation paid to air cargo carriers is generally based on a negotiated rate for each load hauled and purchased transportation paid to ocean cargo carriers is generally based on contractually
agreed-upon fixed rates. Purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage, rail intermodal and ocean cargo services is normally higher than that of BCO Independent Contractor and air cargo services. Purchased
transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and, on a consolidated basis, increases or decreases as a percentage of consolidated revenue in proportion to changes in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated through BCO
Independent Contractors and other third party capacity providers and external revenue from the insurance segment, consisting of reinsurance premiums. Purchased transportation as a percent of revenue also increases or decreases in relation to the
availability of truck brokerage capacity and with changes in the price of fuel on revenue hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers. The Company passes 100% of fuel surcharges billed to customers for freight hauled by BCO Independent Contractors to its BCO
Independent Contractors. These fuel surcharges are excluded from revenue and the cost of purchased transportation. Purchased transportation costs are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery.  
      18  

Table of Contents  

  Commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed-upon percentages of revenue or net
revenue, defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation, or net revenue less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by Landstar. Commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with
fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation and reinsurance premiums and with changes in net revenue margin, defined as net revenue divided by revenue, on services provided by Truck
Brokerage Carriers, railroads, air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers. Commissions to agents are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery.  
 The Company defines gross profit as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents. Gross profit divided by
revenue is referred to as gross profit margin. The Company s operating margin is defined as operating income divided by gross profit.  
 In general, gross profit margin on revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors represents a fixed percentage of revenue due to the nature of
the contracts that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to both the BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents. For revenue hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers, gross profit margin is either fixed or variable as a percent of
revenue, depending on the contract with each individual independent commission sales agent. Under certain contracts with independent commission sales agents, the Company retains a fixed percentage of revenue and the agent retains the amount
remaining less the cost of purchased transportation (the  retention contracts ). Gross profit margin on revenue hauled by railroads, air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and Truck Brokerage Carriers, other than those under retention
contracts, is variable in nature as the Company s contracts with independent commission sales agents provide commissions to agents at a contractually agreed upon percentage of net revenue for these type of loads. Approximately 56% of the
Company s consolidated revenue in the thirty-nine-week period ended September 24, 2016 was generated under contracts that have a fixed gross profit margin while 44% was under contracts that have a variable gross profit margin.  
 Maintenance costs for Company-provided trailing equipment and BCO Independent Contractor recruiting costs are the largest components of other
operating costs. Also included in other operating costs are trailer rental costs, the provision for uncollectible advances and other receivables due from BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents and gains/losses, if any,
on sales of Company-owned trailing equipment.    With respect to insurance and claims cost, potential liability associated with accidents in
the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. For commercial trucking claims, Landstar retains liability up to $5,000,000 per occurrence. The Company also retains liability of up to $1,000,000 for each general liability claim,
up to $250,000 for each workers  compensation claim and up to $250,000 for each cargo claim. The Company s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who
transport freight on behalf of the Company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims or workers 
compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on Landstar s cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations.  
 During the thirty-nine-week period ended September 24, 2016, employee compensation and benefits accounted for approximately sixty-five percent
of the Company s selling, general and administrative costs.    Depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of
trailing equipment and information technology hardware and software.    The following table sets forth the percentage relationship of
purchased transportation and commissions to agents, both being direct costs, to revenue and indirect costs as a percentage of gross profit for the periods indicated:      
 
      19  

Table of Contents  

  Management believes that a discussion of indirect costs as a percentage of gross profit is useful
and meaningful to potential investors for the following principal reasons: (1) disclosure of these relative measures (i.e., each indirect operating cost line item as a percentage of gross profit) allows investors to better understand the
underlying trends in the Company s results of operations; (2) due to the generally fixed nature of these indirect costs (other than insurance and claims costs), these relative measures are meaningful to investors  evaluations of the
Company s management of its indirect costs attributable to operations; (3) management considers this financial information in its decision-making, such as budgeting for infrastructure, trailing equipment and selling, general and administrative
costs; and (4) this information facilitates comparisons by investors of the Company s results to the results of other non-asset or asset-light companies in the transportation and logistics services industry who report  net revenue  in
Management Discussion and Analysis, which represents revenue less the cost of purchased transportation. The difference between the Company s use of the term  gross profit  and use of the term  net revenue  by other companies
in the transportation and logistics services industry is due to the direct cost of commissions to agents under the Landstar business model, whereas other companies in this industry generally have no commissions to agents.  
 Also, as previously mentioned, the Company reports two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment.
External revenue at the insurance segment, representing reinsurance premiums, has historically been relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis at 2% or less of consolidated revenue and generally corresponds directly with the number of trucks
provided by BCO Independent Contractors. The discussion of indirect cost line items in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations considers the Company s costs on a consolidated basis rather than
on a segment basis. Management believes this presentation format is the most appropriate to assist users of the financial statements in understanding the Company s business for the following reasons: (1) the insurance segment has no other
operating costs; (2) discussion of insurance and claims at either segment without reference to the other may create confusion amongst investors and potential investors due to intercompany arrangements and specific deductible programs that affect
comparability of financial results by segment between various fiscal periods but that have no effect on the Company from a consolidated reporting perspective; (3) selling, general and administrative costs of the insurance segment comprise less than
10% of consolidated selling, general and administrative costs and have historically been relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis; and (4) the insurance segment has no depreciation and amortization.  
 THIRTY NINE WEEKS ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2016 COMPARED TO THIRTY NINE WEEKS ENDED SEPTEMBER 26, 2015  
 Revenue for the 2016 thirty-nine-week period was $2,274,805,000, a decrease of $197,684,000, or 8%, compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week
period. Transportation revenue decreased $199,453,000, or 8%. The decrease in transportation revenue was attributable to decreased revenue per load of approximately 8%, while the number of loads hauled in the 2016 thirty-nine week period was
approximately equal to the prior year period. Reinsurance premiums were $34,636,000 and $32,867,000 for the 2016 and 2015 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. The increase in revenue from reinsurance premiums was primarily attributable to the net
increase in the average number of BCO Independent Contractors in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period.  
 Truck transportation revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors and Truck Brokerage Carriers (together, the  third party truck
capacity providers ) for the 2016 thirty-nine-week period was $2,106,415,000, or 93% of total revenue, a decrease of $191,473,000, or 8%, compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period. Revenue per load on loads hauled by third party truck
capacity providers decreased approximately 8% in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period, while the number of loads hauled was approximately equal to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period. The decrease in revenue per
load on loads hauled via truck was primarily attributable to the impact of lower diesel fuel costs on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers, a somewhat softer freight environment as compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period, which resulted in
more readily available truck capacity, and a decrease in the number of loads hauled via heavy specialized equipment, which typically have a higher revenue per load, as a percentage of total truck loads. The number of loads hauled via van equipment
increased 3%, while the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment decreased 8% in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period. Demand for van transportation services utilizing
 
      20

Company provided van trailers, primarily relating to drop and hook services, drove the growth in the number of loads hauled via van trailing equipment during the period. The decrease in the
number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment was entirely attributable to the impact of approximately 33,000 loads hauled in the 2015 thirty-nine-week period related to a significant project for a single account in the automotive industry.
That project was completed at the end of 2015. Excluding the impact of the project loads hauled during the 2015 period, the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment increased 1% during the 2016 thirty-nine-week period. Fuel surcharges
billed to customers on revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors are excluded from revenue. Fuel surcharges on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue identified separately in billings to customers and included as a component of Truck Brokerage Carrier
revenue were $37,723,000 and $65,159,000 in the 2016 and 2015 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. It should be noted that many customers of truck brokerage services require a single all-in rate that does not separately identify fuel
surcharge. Accordingly, the overall impact of changes in fuel prices on revenue and revenue per load on loads hauled via truck may be greater than that indicated.  
 Transportation revenue hauled by rail intermodal, air cargo and ocean cargo carriers (collectively, the  multimode capacity
providers ) for the thirty-nine-week period ended September 24, 2016, was $133,487,000, or 6% of total revenue, a decrease of $7,926,000, or 6%, compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period. The number of loads hauled by multimode capacity
providers in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period increased approximately 12% compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period, while revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers decreased approximately 16% over the same period. The
increase in loads hauled by multimode capacity providers was primarily due to increased rail intermodal loads, mostly attributable to increased loadings at one specific agency, and a 12% increase in loads hauled by air and ocean cargo carriers.
Revenue per load on loads hauled by multimode capacity providers decreased for all modes, primarily due to softness in the U.S. and global economies. Also, revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers is influenced by many
factors, including revenue mix among the various modes of transportation used, length of haul, complexity of freight, density of freight lanes, fuel costs and availability of capacity.  
 Purchased transportation was 76.1% and 76.9% of revenue in the 2016 and 2015 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. The decrease in purchased
transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decreased rate of purchased transportation paid to Truck Brokerage Carriers, primarily due to the impact of lower diesel fuel costs and more readily available capacity and an increase
in the percentage of revenue contributed by BCO Independent Contractors, which typically has a lower rate of purchased transportation than revenue hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers. Commissions to agents were 8.3% and 8.1% of revenue in the 2016
and 2015 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. The increase in commissions to agents as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to an increased net revenue margin on revenue hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers.  
 Investment income was $1,100,000 and $1,043,000 in the 2016 and 2015 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively.  
 Other operating costs decreased $2,904,000 in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period and represented
6.1% of gross profit in the 2016 period compared to 6.5% of gross profit in the 2015 period. The decrease in other operating costs compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased gains on sales of used trailing equipment and decreased
trailing equipment rental costs, partially offset by increased trailing equipment maintenance costs, as the Company increased its number of owned trailers in response to customer demand, and an increased provision for contractor bad debt. The
decrease in other operating costs as a percentage of gross profit was caused by the decrease in other operating costs, partially offset by the effect of decreased gross profit.  
 Insurance and claims increased $5,185,000 in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period and represented
12.1% of gross profit in the 2016 period compared to 10.1% of gross profit in the 2015 period. The increase in insurance and claims compared to prior year was due to increased severity of current year claims in the 2016 period, partially offset by
decreased net unfavorable development of prior years  claims in the 2016 period as unfavorable development of prior year claims was $698,000 and $5,521,000 in the 2016 and 2015 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. The increase in insurance
and claims as a percent of gross profit was caused by the increase in insurance and claims costs related to the increased severity of current year claims in the 2016 period and the effect of decreased gross profit.  
 Selling, general and administrative costs decreased $5,586,000 in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2015 thirty-nine-week
period and represented 29.9% of gross profit in the 2016 period compared to 30.0% of gross profit in the 2015 period. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs compared to prior year was attributable to a decreased provision for
bonuses under the Company s incentive compensation plan, decreased stock compensation expense and a decreased provision for customer bad debt in the 2016 period, partially offset by costs during the 2016 period associated with the
Company s multi-year project designed to improve the Company s information systems. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of gross profit was due primarily to the decrease in selling, general and
administrative costs, partially offset by the effect of decreased gross profit.

  Depreciation and amortization increased $4,856,000 in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period compared
to the 2015 thirty-nine-week period and represented 7.4% of gross profit in the 2016 period compared to 5.7% of gross profit in the 2015 period. The increase in depreciation and amortization costs was due to depreciation on new trailing equipment as
the Company increased its number of owned trailers in response to increased customer demand for the Company s drop and hook services using Company owned van trailers. The increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of gross profit
was primarily due to the increased depreciation costs and the effect of decreased gross profit.    Interest and debt expense in the 2016
thirty-nine-week period was $517,000 higher than the 2015 thirty-nine-week period. The increase in interest and debt expense was primarily attributable to increased interest related to increased capital lease obligations as the Company increased its
number of owned trailers in response to customer demand.    The provisions for income taxes for the 2016 and 2015 thirty-nine-week periods
were based on estimated annual effective income tax rates of 38.1% and 38.2%, respectively, adjusted for discrete events, such as benefits resulting from disqualifying dispositions of the Company s common stock by employees who obtained the
stock through exercises of incentive stock options. The effective income tax rate in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period of 37.6% was less than the 38.1% estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to certain federal income tax credits
realized in the 2016 period and disqualifying dispositions of the Company s common stock by employees who obtained the stock through the exercises of incentive stock options in the 2016 period. The effective income tax rate in the 2015
thirty-nine-week period of 37.9% was less than the 38.2% estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to disqualifying dispositions of the Company s common stock by employees who obtained the stock through exercises of incentive
stock options in the 2015 period.    Net income was $97,776,000, or $2.32 per common share ($2.31 per diluted share), in the 2016
thirty-nine-week period. Net income was $109,834,000, or $2.50 per common share ($2.49 per diluted share), in the 2015 thirty-nine-week period.    THIRTEEN
WEEKS ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2016 COMPARED TO THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED SEPTEMBER 26, 2015    Revenue for the 2016 thirteen-week period was
$787,938,000, a decrease of $53,788,000, or 6%, compared to the 2015 thirteen-week period. Transportation revenue decreased $54,000,000, or 7%. The decrease in transportation revenue was primarily attributable to decreased revenue per load of
approximately 6%, while the number of loads hauled in the 2016 thirteen week period was approximately equal to the prior year perod. Reinsurance premiums were $11,541,000 and $11,329,000 for the 2016 and 2015 thirteen-week periods, respectively. The
increase in revenue from reinsurance premiums was primarily attributable to the net increase in the average number of BCO Independent Contractors in the 2016 thirteen-week period compared to the 2015 thirteen-week period.  
 Truck transportation revenue hauled by third party truck capacity providers for the 2016 thirteen-week period was $732,863,000, or 93% of
total revenue, a decrease of $46,956,000, or 6%, compared to the 2015 thirteen-week period. Revenue per load on loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers decreased approximately 5% in the 2016 thirteen-week period compared to the 2015
thirteen-week period and the number of loads hauled decreased approximately 1% compared to the 2015 thirteen-week period. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled via truck was primarily attributable to the impact of lower diesel fuel costs
on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers and a somewhat softer freight environment as compared to the 2015 thirteen-week period, which resulted in more readily available truck capacity. The decrease in the number of loads hauled via truck of 1%
was entirely attributable to a 14% decrease in the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment. The decrease in the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment of 14% was due to the impact of approximately 20,000 loads hauled in
the 2015 thirteen-week period related to a significant project for a single account in the automotive industry. Excluding the impact of the project loads hauled during the 2015 period, the number of loads hauled via truck increased 4% during the
2016 thirteen-week period on a 6% increase in the number of loads hauled via van equipment and a 1% increase in the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment. The increase in the number of loads hauled via van equipment of 6% was
attributable to increased demand for van transportation services utilizing Company provided van trailers, primarily relating to drop and hook services. Fuel surcharges on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue identified separately in billings to customers
and included as a component of Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue were $14,016,000 and $20,128,000 in the 2016 and 2015 thirteen-week periods, respectively.  
 Transportation revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers for the thirteen-week period ended September 24, 2016, was $43,440,000, or 6% of
total revenue, a decrease of $7,041,000, or 14%, compared to the 2015 thirteen-week period. The number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers in the 2016 thirteen-week period increased approximately 4% compared to the 2015 thirteen-week
period, while revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers decreased approximately 17% over the same period. The increase in loads hauled by multimode capacity providers was broad-based with air, ocean and rail intermodal
loadings  
      22  

Table of Contents  

increasing 10%, 9% and 2%, respectively. Revenue per load on loads hauled by multimode capacity providers decreased for all modes, primarily due to softness in the U.S. and global economies.
Revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers is influenced by many factors, including revenue mix among the various modes of transportation used, length of haul, complexity of freight, density of freight lanes, fuel costs and
availability of capacity.    Purchased transportation was 76.3% and 76.7% of revenue in the 2016 and 2015 thirteen-week periods,
respectively. The decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of revenue contributed by BCO Independent Contractors, which typically has a lower rate of purchased transportation
than revenue on loads hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers. Commissions to agents were 8.3% and 8.2% of revenue in the 2016 and 2015 thirteen-week periods, respectively.  
 Investment income was $357,000 and $350,000 in the 2016 and 2015 thirteen-week periods, respectively.  
 Other operating costs decreased $1,226,000 in the 2016 thirteen-week period compared to the 2015 thirteen-week period and represented 6.2% of
gross profit in the 2016 period compared to 6.9% of gross profit in the 2015 period. The decrease in other operating costs compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased gains on sales of used trailing equipment and decreased trailing
equipment rental costs. The decrease in other operating costs as a percentage of gross profit was caused by the decrease in other operating costs, partially offset by the effect of decreased gross profit.  
 Insurance and claims increased $1,986,000 in the 2016 thirteen-week period compared to the 2015 thirteen-week period and represented 10.3% of
gross profit in the 2016 period compared to 8.3% of gross profit in the 2015 period. The increase in insurance and claims compared to prior year was due to increased severity of current year claims in the 2016 period, partially offset by increased
net favorable development of prior years  claims in the 2016 period as development of prior year claims was $2,118,000 favorable and $47,000 unfavorable in the 2016 and 2015 thirteen-week periods, respectively. The increase in insurance and
claims as a percent of gross profit was caused by the increase in insurance and claims costs related to the increased severity of current year claims, partially offset by the increased net favorable development of prior years  claims in the
2016 period and the effect of decreased gross profit.    Selling, general and administrative costs decreased $2,119,000 in the 2016
thirteen-week period compared to the 2015 thirteen-week period and represented 28.5% of gross profit in the 2016 period compared to 29.0% of gross profit in the 2015 period. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs compared to prior
year was attributable to a decreased provision for bonuses under the Company s incentive compensation plan and a decrease in stock compensation expense in the 2016 period, partially offset by costs during the 2016 period associated with the
Company s multi-year project designed to improve the Company s information systems. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of gross profit was due primarily to the decrease in selling, general and
administrative costs, partially offset by the effect of decreased gross profit.    Depreciation and amortization increased $1,831,000 in the
2016 thirteen-week period compared to the 2015 thirteen-week period and represented 7.4% of gross profit in the 2016 period compared to 5.7% of gross profit in the 2015 period. The increase in depreciation and amortization costs was due to
depreciation on new trailing equipment as the Company increased its number of owned trailers in response to increased customer demand for the Company s drop and hook services using the Company s van trailers. The increase in depreciation
and amortization as a percentage of gross profit was primarily due to the increased depreciation costs and the effect of decreased gross profit.  
 Interest and debt expense in the 2016 thirteen-week period was $234,000 higher than the 2015 thirteen-week period. The increase in interest
and debt expense was primarily attributable to increased interest related to increased capital lease obligations as the Company increased its number of owned trailers in response to customer demand for the Company s drop and hook services using
Company owned van trailers.    The provisions for income taxes for the 2016 and 2015 thirteen-week periods were based on estimated annual
effective income tax rates of 38.1% and 38.2%, respectively, adjusted for discrete events, such as benefits resulting from disqualifying dispositions of the Company s common stock by employees who obtained the stock through exercises of
incentive stock options. The effective income tax rate in the 2016 thirteen-week period of 36.9% was less than the 38.1% estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to certain federal income tax credits realized in the 2016 period and
disqualifying dispositions of the Company s common stock by employees who obtained the stock through the exercises of incentive stock options in the 2016 period. The effective income tax rate in the 2015 thirteen-week period of 37.8% was less
than the 38.2% estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to disqualifying dispositions of the Company s common stock by employees who obtained the stock through exercises of incentive stock options in the 2015 period.

  Net income was $36,278,000, or $0.86 per common share ($0.86 per diluted share), in the 2016
thirteen-week period. Net income was $39,348,000, or $0.91 per common share ($0.90 per diluted share), in the 2015 thirteen-week period.    CAPITAL
RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY    Working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities were $318,461,000 and 1.9 to 1,
respectively, at September 24, 2016, compared with $286,581,000 and 1.8 to 1, respectively, at December 26, 2015. Landstar has historically operated with current ratios within the range of 1.5 to 1 to 2.0 to 1. Cash provided by operating
activities was $171,297,000 in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period compared with $148,084,000 in the 2015 thirty-nine-week period. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the timing of collections of
trade receivables.    The Company declared and paid $0.25 per share, or $10,572,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during the
thirty-nine-week period ended September 24, 2016. The Company declared and paid $0.22 per share, or $9,673,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during the thirty-nine-week period ended September 26, 2015 and, during such period, also paid
$44,794,000 of dividends payable which were declared during fiscal year 2014 and included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 27, 2014. During the thirty-nine-week period ended September 24, 2016, the Company
purchased 773,281 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $50,516,000. As of September 24, 2016, the Company may purchase up to an additional 1,036,125 shares of its common stock under its authorized stock purchase program. Long-term debt,
including current maturities, was $135,601,000 at September 24, 2016, $11,309,000 higher than at December 26, 2015.    Shareholders 
equity was $506,730,000, or 79% of total capitalization (defined as long-term debt including current maturities plus equity), at September 24, 2016, compared to $466,237,000, or 79% of total capitalization, at December 26, 2015. The increase in
equity was primarily a result of net income, partially offset by the purchases of shares of the Company s common stock and dividends declared by the Company in the 2016 thirty-nine-week period.  
 On June 2, 2016, Landstar entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent
(the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement, which matures on June 2, 2021, provides $250,000,000 of borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility, $50,000,000 of which may be utilized in the form of letter of credit
guarantees. The Credit Agreement includes an  accordion  feature providing for a possible increase up to an aggregate borrowing amount of $400,000,000. The Company s prior credit agreement was terminated on June 2, 2016.  
 The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that limit, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The Company is
required to, among other things, maintain a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, below a specified maximum. The Credit Agreement provides for a
restriction on cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders on the Company s capital stock to the extent there is a default under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement under certain circumstances limits the
amount of such cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders to the extent that, after giving effect to any payment made to effect such cash dividend or other distribution, the Leverage Ratio would exceed 2.5 to 1 on a pro forma basis as of
the end of the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement provides for an event of default in the event that, among other things, a person or group acquires 35% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company
or obtains power to elect a majority of the Company s directors or the directors cease to consist of a majority of Continuing Directors, as defined in the Credit Agreement. None of these covenants are presently considered by management to be
materially restrictive to the Company s operations, capital resources or liquidity. The Company is currently in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the Credit Agreement.  
 At September 24, 2016, the Company had no borrowings outstanding and $35,601,000 of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
At September 24, 2016, there was $214,399,000 available for future borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company has $61,110,000 in letters of credit outstanding as collateral for insurance claims that are secured by investments
totaling $67,900,000 at September 24, 2016. Investments, all of which are carried at fair value, include primarily investment-grade bonds and U.S. Treasury obligations having maturities of up to five years. Fair value of investments is
based primarily on quoted market prices. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further discussion on measurement of fair value of investments.  
 Historically, the Company has generated sufficient operating cash flow to meet its debt service requirements, fund continued growth, both
organic and through acquisitions, complete or execute share purchases of its common stock under authorized share purchase  
      24

programs, pay dividends and meet working capital needs. As an asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions, the Company s annual capital requirements for operating
property are generally for trailing equipment and information technology hardware and software. In addition, a significant portion of the trailing equipment used by the Company is provided by third party capacity providers, thereby reducing the
Company s capital requirements. During the 2016 thirty-nine-week period, the Company purchased $17,833,000 of operating property, including $2,400,000 paid for a parcel of land in Laredo, Texas for the purposes of building a new freight staging
and transload facility, and $11,700,000 paid related to development of this parcel. Landstar also acquired $3,237,000 of operating property relating to the development of the Laredo parcel for which the Company accrued a corresponding liability in
accounts payable as of September 24, 2016. During the 2016 thirty-nine-week period, the Company also acquired $46,456,000 of trailing equipment by entering into capital leases. Landstar anticipates acquiring either by purchase or lease financing
during the remainder of fiscal year 2016 approximately $25,000,000 in operating property, consisting primarily of new trailing equipment to replace older trailing equipment, information technology equipment and approximately $7,200,000 in additional
capital requirements to complete the Laredo facility.    Management believes that cash flow from operations combined with the Company s
borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet Landstar s debt service requirements, fund continued growth, both internal and through acquisitions, pay dividends, complete the authorized share purchase program and meet
working capital needs.    LEGAL MATTERS    The
Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Many of these claims are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside
counsel, management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year.  
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES    The
allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents management s estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected. Historically, management s estimates for uncollectible receivables
have been materially correct. Although management believes the amount of the allowance for both trade and other receivables at September 24, 2016 is appropriate, a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of
these receivables. In addition, liquidity concerns and/or unanticipated bankruptcy proceedings at any of the Company s larger customers in which the Company is carrying a significant receivable could result in an increase in the provision for
uncollectible receivables and have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations in a given quarter or year. However, it is not expected that an uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from an individual customer would have a
significant impact on the Company s financial condition. Conversely, a more robust economic environment or the recovery of a previously provided for uncollectible receivable from an individual customer may result in the realization of some
portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables.    Landstar provides for the estimated costs of self-insured claims primarily on an
actuarial basis. The amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date. The ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less
than the amount estimated by management. The Company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim. Historically, the Company has experienced both favorable and
unfavorable development of prior years  claims estimates. During the 2016 and 2015 thirty-nine-week periods, insurance and claims costs included $698,000 and $5,521,000 of net unfavorable adjustments to prior years  claims estimates,
respectively. The unfavorable development of prior years  claims in the 2015 fiscal period primarily related to a single claim for which the Company incurred a pre-tax charge of $4,500,000. It is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of
settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims reserve at September 24, 2016.    The Company utilizes
certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes. If the Company were to be subject to an audit, it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes.
Certain of these tax planning strategies result in a level of uncertainty as to whether the related tax positions taken by the Company would result in a recognizable benefit. The Company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to such
tax positions due to the corresponding level of uncertainty with respect to the amount of income tax benefit that may ultimately be realized. Management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the uncertainty in certain income tax
positions is appropriate. To date, the Company has not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the Company s past provisions for exposures related to the uncertainty of such
income tax positions are not appropriate.  
      25  

Table of Contents  

  Significant variances from management s estimates for the amount of uncollectible
receivables, the ultimate resolution of self-insured claims and the provision for uncertainty in income tax positions could each be expected to positively or negatively affect Landstar s earnings in a given quarter or year. However, management
believes that the ultimate resolution of these items, given a range of reasonably likely outcomes, will not significantly affect the long-term financial condition of Landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations.  
 EFFECTS OF INFLATION    Management does not
believe inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of Landstar in the past five years. However, inflation in excess of historic trends might have an adverse effect on the Company s results of
operations in the future.    SEASONALITY  
 Landstar s operations are subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry. Results of operations for the quarter ending in
March are typically lower than for the quarters ending June, September and December.      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk    The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its financing activities, primarily its
borrowings on its revolving credit facility, and investing activities with respect to investments held by the insurance segment.    On June
2, 2016, Landstar entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement, which matures on June 2, 2021, provides $250,000,000 of
borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility, $50,000,000 of which may be utilized in the form of letter of credit guarantees. The Credit Agreement includes an  accordion  feature providing for a possible increase up to an
aggregate borrowing amount of $400,000,000.    Depending upon the specific type of borrowing, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear
interest based on either (a) the prime rate, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York rate plus 0.5% or (c) the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus 1.25%. As of September 24, 2016 and during the entire 2016 third quarter, the Company had no
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.    Long-term investments, all of which are available-for-sale and are carried at fair
value, include primarily investment-grade bonds and U.S. Treasury obligations having maturities of up to five years. Assuming that the long-term portion of investments remains at $53,002,000, the balance at September 24, 2016, a hypothetical
increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would not have a material impact on future earnings on an annualized basis. Short-term investments consist of short-term investment-grade instruments and the current maturities of
investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury obligations. Accordingly, any future interest rate risk on these short-term investments would not be material to the Company s operating results.  
 Assets and liabilities of the Company s Canadian operations are translated from their functional currency to U.S. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Transactional gains and losses arising from receivable and payable balances, including intercompany balances, in the normal course of business that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operation are recorded in the
statements of income when they occur. The assets held at the Company s Canadian subsidiary at September 24, 2016 were, as translated to U.S. dollars, approximately 1% of total consolidated assets. Accordingly, any translation gain or loss
related to the Canadian operation would not be material.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) promulgated under the  
      26  

Table of Contents  

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 24,
2016 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.    There were no significant changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 24, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
   In designing and evaluating controls and procedures, Company management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Because of the inherent limitation in any control system, no evaluation or implementation of a control system can provide complete assurance that all control issues and all possible instances of fraud have been or will be detected.  
   PART II  
 OTHER INFORMATION      

Item 1. 
 Legal Proceedings      The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising
from the normal conduct of business. Many of these claims are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes that adequate provisions have been made
for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, but could have
a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year.      

Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors      Except as set forth in the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended June 25, 2016, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in Part I  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015 as filed with the SEC.

Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement, under certain circumstances, limits the amount of such cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders to the extent that, after giving effect to any payment made to effect such cash
dividend or other distribution, the Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, would exceed 2.5 to 1 on a pro forma basis as of the end of the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter.
