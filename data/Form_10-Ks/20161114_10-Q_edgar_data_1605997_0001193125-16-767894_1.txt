1.  
  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS       Northern Power Systems Corp. (together with its consolidated
subsidiaries,  Northern Power Systems  or the  Company ) is a provider of advanced renewable power creation and power conversion technology for the energy sector. We design, manufacture and service next-generation Permanent
Magnet Direct-Drive, or PMDD, wind turbines for the distributed wind market, and we currently license our utility-class wind turbine platform, which uses the same PMDD technology as our distributed turbines, to large manufacturers on a global basis.
We also provide technology development services for a wide variety of energy applications. With our predecessor companies dating back to 1974 and our new turbine development since 1977, we have decades of experience in developing advanced,
innovative wind turbines, as well as technology for power conversion and integration with other energy applications.    The Company s
headquarters are in Barre, Vermont, with additional office space in Waltham, Massachusetts, Zurich, Switzerland, Bari, Italy, and Cornwall, U.K.  
 On October 26, 2016, the Company, announced that it had executed a definitive agreement for WEG Electric Corp. and WEG Equipamentos
Eletricos S.A. (collectively,  WEG ) to acquire some of the Company s utility wind assets. Under the agreement, the proven utility scale direct drive technology developed will be solely owned by WEG and its affiliates. All assets and
liabilities, including the related patent portfolio for utility wind greater than 1.5MW and the engineering team largely responsible for developing this technology, will be acquired by WEG. WEG will continue to compensate the Company under the
existing arrangement paying royalties for sales in South America resulting in future payments of up to approximately $10.0 million, of which $3.0 million are fixed payments. Additionally, WEG will pay the Company up to $17.5 million in royalty
payments over the next decade for turbines shipped anywhere outside of South America. As a result of this transaction we reclassified certain assets and liabilities as held for sale, see Note 14.  
  Going Concern    The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception. Management anticipates incurring additional losses
until the Company can produce sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs, if ever. Since inception, the Company has funded its net capital requirements with proceeds from private equity and public and debt offerings. At September 30, 2016,
the Company has cash of $3.2 million and an accumulated deficit of $176.5 million. In September 2016, the Company amended its foreign working capital revolving line of credit with Comerica to extend the maturity date of September 30, 2016 to
December 31, 2017. The line of credit was reduced from $6,000 to $2,000, with the available borrowing base being limited to the amount of collateral available at the time the line is drawn. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     Basis of Presentation    The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of  Regulation S-X. 
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements and, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the Company s 2015 consolidated financial statements and related
notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (File No. 000-55184). The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the Company s annual audited financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amount of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses reported and disclosed.
Actual amounts could differ from these estimates. All adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods, have been recorded.
Actual amounts could differ from these estimates. Due to differing business conditions and seasonality, operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
in subsequent quarters or for the full year ending December 31, 2016.     Comprehensive Loss    Foreign currency translation
adjustments are excluded from net loss and shown as a separate component of shareholders  equity.     Recent Accounting
Pronouncements    In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606) ( ASU 2014-09 ). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an
entity should apply the following steps: identify the contract(s) with a customer; identify the performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;
and recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 605, Revenue Recognition, most industry-specific
guidance  
      8  

Table of Contents  

throughout the industry topics of the accounting standards codification, and some cost guidance related to construction-type and production-type contracts. ASU 2014-09 is effective for public
entities for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU
2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.    In
August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606) : Deferral of the Effective Date  ( ASU 2015-14 ) .  ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date
of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. As such, it now takes effect for public entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for any entity that chooses to adopt the new standard as of the
original effective date (December 15, 2015). The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.  
 In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern 
(Subtopic 205-40):  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ) which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the
financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide
certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this accounting standard update may have on its current practices.  
 In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11,  Inventory  (Topic 330). Topic 330, Inventory, currently
requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The amendments in this update require an entity to
measure inventory within the scope of this update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. For public business entities,
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The application of this ASU will not have an impact on our financial statements.  
 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall   (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The new standard amends certain aspects of accounting and disclosure requirements of financial instruments, including the requirement that equity investments with readily determinable
fair values be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in our results of operations. The new standard does not apply to investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the
investee. This new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods with those fiscal year. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results
of operations.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases  (Topic 842). The new standard requires that all
lessees recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet and disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its leasing arrangements. This new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging  (Topic 815):  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt
Instruments . The new standard simplifies the embedded derivative analysis for debt instruments containing contingent call or put options by removing the requirement to assess whether a contingent event is related to interest rates or credit
risks. This new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods with those fiscal year. The application of this ASU will not have an impact on the Company s financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Investments    Equity Method and Joint Ventures  (Topic 323):  Simplifying
the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting . The new standard eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence,
an adjustment must be made to the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. This new
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods with those fiscal year. The application of this ASU will not have an impact on the Company s financial statements.

  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock
Compensation  (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The new standard involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods with those fiscal year. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.    In April 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606). This update clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in the new revenue recognition
standard. The Update includes targeted improvements based on input the Board received from the Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition and other stakeholders. The Update seeks to proactively address areas in which diversity in practice
potentially could arise, as well as to reduce the cost and complexity of applying certain aspects of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basis. The amendments in this update are effective at the same time as ASU 2014-09. Public
business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that
reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements.    In August
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows  (Topic 230). This updates indicates that there is diversity in the practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of
cash flows under Topic 230.This amendments provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. Public business entities should apply the guidance in Update 2016-151018136-03 to
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
 There were no other new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective since the issuance of our 2015 Annual Report on Form
10-K that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

  NET LOSS PER SHARE       Basic loss per share is determined by dividing net loss attributable
to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is determined by dividing loss attributable to common shareholders by diluted weighted average shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted weighted average shares reflect the dilutive effect, if any, of potential common shares. To the extent their effect is dilutive, employee equity awards and warrants, based on the treasury stock method, are included in the calculation of
diluted earnings per share. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, all potential common shares were anti-dilutive due to the net loss and were excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculations.  
 The calculations of basic and diluted net loss per share are as follows:  
   
   The following potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of dilutive weighted average
shares outstanding because they were considered anti-dilutive due to the Company s loss position:      
   The Company had 367,500 placement agent options that expired on March 17, 2016. In addition, the Company
has 2,313,193 options outstanding as of September 30, 2016 related to the 2014 NPS Corp. plan. As of September 30, 2015, the Company had 367,500 placement agent options outstanding, 2,749,441 options outstanding and 105,734 of unvested
restricted stock awards outstanding related to the 2014 NPS Corp. plan. Such options are considered to be potentially dilutive securities.      

3.  
  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT       The Company measures fair value using the framework specified in
U.S. GAAP. This framework emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an equity-specific measurement, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data obtained from independent
sources and those based on an entity s own assumptions. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs for fair value measurement into three levels:  
  Level 1    Measurements utilizing unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the entity has the ability to access for
identical assets or liabilities.     Level 2    Measurements that include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and other observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.  
  Level 3    Measurements using unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities for which little or no market information exists,
and are based on the best information available and might include the entity s own data.    In some valuations, the inputs used may
fall into different levels of the hierarchy. In these cases, the financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Table of Contents  

   Financial Instruments    The Company s financial instruments consist
primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled revenue, accounts payable, the working capital revolving line of credit and debt, deferred revenue and customer deposits. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, unbilled revenue, accounts payable and the working capital revolving line of credit, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature and are classified within Level
3 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company defines cash equivalents as highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less that are regarded as high quality, low risk investments. Cash equivalents when held consist of principally FDIC
insured certificates of deposits.     Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements    The Company holds certain assets and
liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition.    During 2014, the
Company entered into a technology development contract with a customer that will result in the Company receiving a royalty free license upon successful completion of the development. The Company determined the value of this license using a
probability weighted analysis. The analysis applied a range of possibilities to a set of possible outcomes and attributed a value in the event of each outcome. The probabilities and weightings used in the analysis were based on management s
views of the opportunities that will be available to the Company upon completion of the contract and receipt of the license, as well as a review of the outcomes that would result from the selected scenarios. The Company determined this was the most
reliable approach to value the license. The license will be accreted to full value over the development period of the contract and will subsequently be amortized over its estimated useful life at the time. The value assigned to the license as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $792, this represents a fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis, and is included in assets held for sale on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Due to the unobservable key
inputs to the analysis, the license has been classified as Level 3.    In 2015, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts
and no-cost collars, usually with one to three month durations, to mitigate the foreign currency risk related to certain balance sheet positions. The Company has not elected hedge accounting for these transactions. There were no foreign currency
forward contracts entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. There were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2016.      

4.  
  INVENTORIES       Inventories, net of reserves, as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 consist of:      
   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded inventory provision of $7
and $19, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded inventory provision of approximately $193 and $151, respectively.

As part of an agreement with WEG Equipamentos El tricos S.A. to develop a 3.3 MW wind turbine, the
Company has recorded an intangible asset of $792 representing the earned value of the royalty free license the Company will receive upon completion of the development project. The Company s estimate of the total value of this intangible asset
will be capitalized over the period of the development project. Amortization of the intangible asset will commence as the Company completes the project and has the ability to license/sell the 3.3 MW wind turbine. During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, $792 of assets were reclassified as assets held for sale as of September 30, 2016 and $848 as of December 31, 2015.  
 Amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $32 and $124, respectively. Amortization expense for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $46 and $139, respectively.    The expected aggregate future amortization expense,

  In September 2016, the Company amended its foreign working capital revolving line of credit with
Comerica to extend the maturity date of September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The line of credit was reduced from $6,000 to $2,000, with the available borrowing base being limited to the amount of collateral available at the time the
line is drawn. All other significant terms of the line of credit remained the same. The renegotiated loan agreement with Comerica contains a financial covenant which requires the Company to maintain unencumbered liquid assets having a value of at
least $1,000 at all times.    At September 30, 2016, there was $1,900 outstanding on the revolving line of credit as well $0
outstanding in performance and warranty letters of credit and the Company had a net maximum supported borrowing base, in excess of loans outstanding, of $100.

  STOCK BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS        Prior Plans   
 The Company had four equity incentive plans. As a result of the RTO all of these plans were converted in substance to the Northern Power
Systems Corp. 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan ( 2014 NPS Corp Plan ).     2014 Northern Power Systems Corp. Stock Option
and Incentive Plan    In April 2014 and as a result of the reverse takeover transaction, the Company adopted the 2014 NPS Corp Plan, which reserved 4,000,000 shares of the Company s voting common shares for both future exercise of
outstanding stock options and shares available for future outstanding grants. All other relevant terms and conditions remained the same. At such time the Company considered the modification of such awards in accordance with ASC 718 and concluded
that such transaction did not result in additional compensation expense. The Company is accounting for grants under the 2014 NPS Corp Plan as equity awards.  
 A summary of the stock option activity under the 2014 NPS Corp Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is as follows:

Table of Contents  

As of September 30, 2016, 1,229,427 options were available for grant under the 2014 NPS Corp Plan.  
 The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between the fair value of common shares and the exercise price of
outstanding, in-the-money, stock options.    The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted under the 2014 NPS Corp Plan
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.08 per share. At September 30, 2016, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options is $360 which is expected to be recognized over the
weighted-average remaining vesting period of 1.1 years.    The Company estimated the grant-date fair values of stock options granted in
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions:      
   The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period. The forfeiture rate was 10% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Stock-based compensation expense, a non-cash expense, is included in each respective expense category as follows,
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:      
     
   The Company has a defined contribution plan covering substantially all
of its employees, subject to certain eligibility requirements. Under the plan, participating employees may defer up to 15% of their pre-tax compensation, as defined. As of January 1, 2016, the Company contributes 25% of the amount contributed
by a participating employee, up to a maximum of 6% of the participant s pre-tax compensation. Prior to January 1, 2016, the Company contributed 50% of the amount contributed by a participating employee, up to a maximum of 6% of the
participant s pre-tax compensation. Company matching contributions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $15, and $57, respectively, and $45 and $160 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015,
respectively.      
   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded income tax expense of $62 and $250, respectively, which is comprised of $59 current expense and $3 deferred expense for the 3 months ended September 30, 2016 and is comprised of $240 current expense and $10 deferred expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016.

  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded income tax
expense of $372 and $1,140, respectively, which is comprised of $369 current expense and $3 deferred expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and is comprised of $1,130 current expense and $10 deferred expense for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 the current income tax expense included $42
and $203, respectively, of foreign tax expense related to Brazilian withholding taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the current income tax expense included $350 and $1,074, respectively, of foreign tax expense related
to Brazilian withholding taxes. Such taxes are applicable to licensing, technology services and royalty revenues earned within Brazil. The tax rate for such taxes is between 15%-18% and is based upon the character of the revenue and the jurisdiction
of where it was earned.    As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $127,696 of federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire
beginning in 2028, $75,831 of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire from 2016 through 2034, and $1,312 of research and development tax credits that expire beginning in 2028. The net operating loss carryforwards include approximately $71
for which a benefit will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when realized. In addition, the amount of the net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards that may be utilized annually to offset future taxable income
and tax liability may be limited as a result of certain ownership changes pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.    The
Company has completed a study, through November 30, 2014, to assess if any ownership changes would have caused limitations to net operating loss carryforwards. Based upon that study, the Company has concluded an ownership change occurred on
September 19, 2008 and therefore there is the potential for $2,600 of net operating loss to be limited. For the period September 20, 2008 through November 30, 2014, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that there
has not been an ownership change under Section 382 through November 30, 2014. We have not completed and updated a Section 382 study, since November 30, 2014, and as such are not able to assess whether an ownership change has
occurred that could cause limitations to our net operating loss carryforwards.    Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A
valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not  more likely than not . The net deferred tax liability as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes deferred tax liabilities related to
amortizable goodwill, which are anticipated to reverse in an indefinite period and which are not currently available as a source of taxable income.  
 The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements only those tax positions that are  more likely than not  of being
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. As of September 30, 2016, there are no uncertain tax positions. In addition, there are no amounts required to be included in the financial
statements for interest or penalties on uncertain tax positions.      
   The Company s segments are defined as components of the
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  
 The performance of the segments is evaluated based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measures are segment revenues, gross
profits, and loss from operations. The disaggregated financial results of the segments reflect the allocation of certain functional expense categories consistent with the basis and manner in which management internally disaggregates financial
information for the purpose of assisting in making internal operating decisions. In addition, certain expenses and other shared costs which management does not believe are specifically and directly attributable or allocable to any of the business
segments have been excluded from the presented segment contribution margins. The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. The Company assigns revenues to individual countries based on the
customer s shipment location.    The Company manages its business with the four following segments:  

Product Sales and Service   Included in this business segment are the Company s sales of distributed turbines along with related services, other products produced and sold to customers, as well as, in the
future, the Company s direct sales of utility-class turbines.        

Technology Licensing   Included in this business segment is the licensing of packages of the Company s developed technology.    

Technology Development   Included in this business segment is the Company s development of technology for customers.

Shared Services   These costs and expenses are comprised mainly of the general and administrative departments including executive, finance and accounting, legal, human resources, and information technology support,
as well as certain shared engineering, and in certain circumstances, sales and marketing activities.      Unallocated costs and
expenses include depreciation and amortization, stock compensation, and certain other non-cash charges, such as restructuring and impairment charges.  
 Revenue for the business segments are shown as follows:      
   Loss from operations for the business segments and unallocated costs and expenses are as follows:

   On October 26, 2016, the Company, announced that it had
executed a definitive agreement for WEG to acquire the Company s utility wind assets. As of August 2016, the assets and liabilities associated with utility scale business became assets and liabilities held for sale based upon the decision by
our Board of Directors at such time, as well as meeting the other criteria in   ASC 360-10-45-9,    Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets   Other
Presentation Matters, Long-Lived Assets Classified as Held for Sale . Therefore, we reclassified the associated receivables, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as the related other current and long-term liabilities as
held for sale as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Based upon current negotiations, we believe that the current fair value of the net assets held for sale will exceed the carrying value.  

The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date of the
filing and had no additional subsequent events to report.      

16.  
  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES       The Company has sold two prototype turbines to a customer
resulting in a potential cost to perform a separately priced maintenance agreement. The Company is accounting for this contract is under ASC 460 Guarantees, which requires that the measurement of a guarantee liability be the fair value of the
obligation at the reporting period. If the consideration of the fair value of an obligation results in the potential of a contingent loss, consideration of the probable and estimable criteria of ASC 450-20-25 is appropriate. Furthermore, for
longer-term obligations, such as this, the Company considers the use of a discount factor in determining the estimated liability to be appropriate. The Company originally estimated the discounted value of such exposure at $562, using a discount rate
of 9% over approximately 10 years. The agreement was extended to December 2025 in the first quarter of 2015. The total liability related to this exposure, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, is $306 and $406, respectively, of
which $79 and $160, respectively, is recorded as a liability held for sale, as it was assumed by WEG as part of the transaction discussed in Note 14.  
 The Defense Contract Auditing Agency ( DCAA ) is currently auditing the years 2004 through 2007 and an external independent audit
firm is auditing 2010. These audits are in various stages of completion. During the six months ended June 30,  
      19  

Table of Contents  

2015 field work on the 2004 audit was completed and a final report issued to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). NREL has not issued a final determination related to the findings as
of September 30, 2016. There has been no activity related to audits of any other year and although the Company has not received formal notification that such audits are on hold, management believes that as of the date of these financial
statements these audits have been delayed or placed on hold. Based upon the lack of a final determination from NREL on the 2004 audit and lack of activity on later audits, the Company does not have adequate information at the date of issuance of
these financial statements to determine if the outcome of any of these remaining open audits will result in a cost to the Company. The Company, however, does not expect a material impact based on the results of previous audits.  
 The Company has entered into several operating lease agreements, primarily for the lease of office facilities, and office equipment, expiring
through 2019. Rental expense under these operating lease arrangements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $103 and $311, respectively. Rental expense under these operating lease arrangements for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was $103 and $311, respectively. The Company has leased its headquarters and production facility back from the buyer for up to a five year term. Effective as of the second anniversary of the lease commencement (June 19,
2014), the Company has an annual right to terminate the lease without penalty. Therefore, only nine months (October 2016 through June 2017) of rental expense is included in the table below. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable lease
agreements (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) are as follows:      
   If the Company continues to lease the facility after the three year cancellation period, it would have
additional annual lease payment obligations of $173 in 2017, $345 in 2018 and $173 in 2019.       Item 2.

   Overview     We
are a provider of advanced renewable power creation and power conversion technology for the energy sector. We design, manufacture and service next-generation permanent magnet direct-drive, or PMDD, wind turbines for the distributed wind market, and
we license our utility-class wind turbine platform, which uses the same PMDD technology as our distributed turbines, to large manufacturers on a global basis. We also provide technology development services for a wide variety of energy applications.
With our predecessor companies dating back to 1974 and our new turbine development since 1977, we have decades of experience in developing advanced, innovative wind turbines, as well as technology for power conversion and integration with other
energy applications.    Our PMDD wind turbine technology is based on a simplified architecture that utilizes a unique combination of a permanent magnet
generator and direct-drive design. The permanent magnet generator provides higher efficiency and higher energy capture than units that utilize a traditional gearbox design. Importantly, the direct-drive design of our turbine utilizes significantly
fewer moving parts than traditional geared turbines, which increases reliability due to reduced maintenance and downtime costs.    The substantial majority
of our current sales are in the small wind subset of the distributed wind market, which commonly consists of turbines with rated capacities of 500 kW output or smaller. Based on the number of turbines that we have sold and installed to date, we
consider ourselves a leader in the U.S., U.K., and Italy in the larger energy output sub-segment of this market, which comprises turbines ranging in size from 50 kW to 100 kW. Since the introduction of our second generation 60 kW and 100 kW PMDD
wind turbines in late 2008, we have shipped over 600 of these turbines. To date, these shipped units have run for over twelve million hours in the aggregate. Our distributed wind customers include financial investors and project developers which
deploy our turbines to provide power for farms, remote villages, schools, small businesses, and U.S. military installations.    We have developed a 2 MW
turbine platform with three wind-speed regime variants based upon our PMDD technology, of which the 2.3 MW variant is certified to International Electrotechnical Commission, or IEC, standard 61400-1 by Det Norske Veritas, or DNV, a globally
recognized certification firm. In 2013, we launched a strategy of partnering with large-scale manufacturers in developing regions, starting with a multi-billion dollar (in revenue) industrial equipment manufacturer based in Brazil, WEG Equipamentos
El tricos S.A., or WEG.    On October 26, 2016, we announced that we had executed a definitive agreement for WEG Electric Corp. and WEG
Equipamentos Eletricos S.A. (collectively,  WEG ) to acquire some of our utility wind assets. Under the agreement, the proven utility scale direct drive technology developed will be solely owned by WEG and its affiliates. All assets and
liabilities, including the related patent portfolio for utility wind greater than 1.5MW and the engineering team largely responsible for the developing this technology, will be acquired by WEG. WEG will continue to compensate us under the existing
arrangement paying royalties for sales in South America resulting in future payments of up to approximately $10.0 million, of which $3.0 million are fixed payments. Additionally, WEG will pay us up to $17.5 million in royalty payments over the next
decade for turbines shipped anywhere outside of South America. As a result of this transaction we reclassified certain assets and liabilities as held for sale, see Note 14.  
 As previously disclosed, on August 10, 2016, the Company re-aligned its leadership to focus its future on delivering business solutions for a range of
distributed energy customers. As part of this transition our Board of Directors has decided to eliminate the office of chief executive and form an office of the president and chief operating officer which was filled by the former chief
financial officer of the Company.    We have been developing our power converter technology since the early 2000s and currently sell our MW power converters
under the branded name of FlexPhase. These products are supplied as part of our distributed wind and utility class turbines, and also sold independently for use in microgrids and energy storage projects. Our power converters are modular in nature
allowing for a common platform to service multiple applications. As of December 31, 2015, we have deployed over 130 MW of products based on this technology, primarily in connection with our wind turbine designs. Our intention is to
commercialize sales of our power converters outside of the wind industry, such as the battery energy storage system (BESS) market.    In addition to wind
turbine and product development, we provide technology development services to customers to develop products and technology for a variety of complex energy applications, including energy storage, microgrids, and grid stabilization. While the
customer owns the developed technology for a limited field of use, we typically maintain a license for all other applications and all other markets. While we do not expect material revenue from our development services, these services fund the
expansion of our intellectual property portfolio.    For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we generated
$12.1 million, and $13.4 million in revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred net losses of $1.4 million, and $0.5 million, respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $176.5 million as of
September 30, 2016.    We are headquartered in Barre, Vermont, and lease additional office space in Waltham, Massachusetts, Zurich, Switzerland, Bari,
Italy, and Cornwall, U.K. We were originally incorporated in Delaware on August 12, 2008 as Wind Power Holdings, Inc., or WPHI.

In February 2014, WPHI filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 (File No. 001-36317) with the SEC to register the shares of common stock of WPHI, which became effective on June 3,
2014. On April 16, 2014, we (as WPHI) completed a reverse takeover transaction, or RTO, with Mira III Acquisition Corp., or Mira III, a Canadian capital pool company incorporated in British Columbia, Canada, whereby all of the equity securities
of WPHI were exchanged (as described below) for common shares and restricted voting shares of Mira III, which became the holding company of our corporate group. In connection with the RTO, Mira III changed its name to Northern Power Systems Corp.,
the WPHI business became Mira III s operating business, the WPHI directors and officers became Mira III s directors and officers, and the WPHI historical consolidated financial statements became the historical consolidated financial
statements of Northern Power Systems Corp.    Upon completion of the RTO, Northern Power Systems Corp. succeeded to WPHI s status as a reporting
company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which permits us to continue to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP. Also in connection
with the RTO, we completed a CDN$24.5 million private placement whereby we issued 6,125,000 subscription receipts, and our common shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the Symbol  NPS .  
  How We Conduct Our Business     We manage our business under
four business segments:      

Product Sales and Service    Included in this business line are our sales of distributed-class turbines along with related services, other products produced and sold to customers, as well as in the future our
direct sales of utility-class turbines. This business line reflects 97% and 95% of our revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and 83% and 80% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015,
respectively.        

Technology Licensing    Included in this business line is the licensing of packages of our developed technology. This business line reflects 0% and 2% of our revenues for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, and 7% and 11% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.        

Technology Development    Included in this business line is our development of technology for specific customer needs. This business line reflects 3% and 3% of our revenues for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, and 10% and 9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.        

Shared Services    These costs and expenses are comprised mainly of the general and administrative departments including executive, finance and accounting, legal, human resources, and information technology
support, as well as certain shared engineering, and in certain circumstances, sales and marketing activities.      Unallocated costs and
expenses include depreciation and amortization, stock compensation, and certain other non-cash charges, such as restructuring and impairment charges.    We
have certain customer segments that are specific to each of our business offerings but we also have customers that see significant value in our ability to bring full suite licensing, development and prototype production of projects and could
therefore leverage offerings across all of these capabilities.    Our international revenue was $10.0 million and $22.6 million for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively and $12.6 million and $30.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, representing 83%, 87%, 94% and 87% of our revenues for those periods,
respectively. We expect the majority of our revenue to continue to be outside of the U.S. for the foreseeable future. A portion of our revenues continue to be denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, which
increased to 66% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 48% of total revenues for the same period in 2015 and increased to 65% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to 40% of total revenues for the same period in 2015. We expect to see a continued significant proportion of our revenues denominated in euro and other non-U.S. dollar currencies over time as we continue to expand our international
sales. We are currently experiencing negative movement between the euro and the U.S. dollar, which has an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. In October 2015, we began employing hedging strategies to reduce currency fluctuation risk.
There were no foreign currency forward contracts entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. There were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2016.  
  How We Evaluate Our Operations     In managing our business
we use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess our performance, including:      

Backlog value of our offerings;

Deferred revenues;        

Segment revenue, gross profits and income (loss) from operations; and        

Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA.        Backlog Value of Our Offerings    
 We track the value of turbine product orders executed with our customers during a period, as well as the cumulative balance of backlog for all of our offerings
as leading indicators of our revenue performance. We consider an order executed when a contract has been duly signed and a deposit for such contract has been received.      

Product Sales    We determine order value for our turbine backlog as the turbine sale price along with our best estimate of other services expected to be rendered, such as shipping, installation and other
services to ensure the effective initial operation of the turbine. Our backlog of orders for distributed turbines generally, but not always, converts to revenue within a one year period. The timing of such revenue recognition is impacted by
customer specific installation conditions such as site preparation and readiness by local utilities for grid connection. In our backlog, we do not include the value of subsequent services such as operations and maintenance support that we might
provide for such turbines. We track order value of other products that we sell based upon our proprietary technologies in aggregate. Other products include non-turbine products such as maintenance kits, generators and converters we assemble and sell
to customers.        

License   Development Activity    We track the value of our license and development activity based on our best estimates on what will be earned in the next twelve months. The timing of revenue
recognized is impacted by the achievement of contractual milestones or the percentage of the work completed as a percentage of the total costs.    
   Deferred Revenues      We believe that
deferred revenue is a leading indicator of our revenue performance. We present values on our balance sheet as deferred revenue at such time as cash has been collected from our customer and certain aspects of the earnings process have been completed
but recognition as revenue has not been achieved in conformity with GAAP. Each of our three customer facing lines typically has deferred revenue balances, including:      

Product Sales and Service    When sales of our products involve transferring title of the equipment at delivery, which we have determined to be the correct point for recognition of revenue for domestic sales
and for sales in which the customer handles logistics, we present products which have been produced and billed but not delivered as deferred revenue. In cases in which the Company handles logistics for the sales to customers in foreign countries, we
recognize revenue when we have met all significant delivery obligations, generally when the product clears customs. We also present products which have been billed prior to the point as deferred revenue. We also defer the recognition of revenue for
our operations and maintenance services that are performed over a period of time; revenue from such contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period. We present cash values collected from customers of such contracts, net of the related
recognized revenue, as deferred revenue.        

Technology Licensing and Technology Development    Our license and technology development agreements frequently result in our collection of cash for our delivery of certain milestones; however, such
milestones do not always reflect the culmination of the earnings process and we therefore present the related cash collections as deferred revenue.    
   Segment Revenues, Gross Profits and Income (Loss) from Operations    
 We define segment gross profit as segment revenues less certain direct cost of sales and services. We define segment income (loss) from operations as segment
gross profit less operating expenses excluding non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, impairments, share-based compensation or restructuring charges. We use these profitability measures internally to track our business performance.  
   Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA      We
believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation, from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the
underlying performance of our business operations. Because of the aforementioned limitations, you should consider non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss), cash flow metrics and our
financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.  
      23  

Table of Contents  

  We define non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization,
non-cash compensation expense, changes in the fair value of certain liability classified instruments, and certain other one-time non-cash charges.  
 Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a Company s performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or
includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, however, should be considered
in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.    Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is a key
financial measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and others, to:      

assess our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;    

assess our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and        

generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions.      Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. Some of the limitations in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA are:  

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future;    

non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;        

non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of share-based compensation;        

non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and        

other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.    
  Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations     We believe
that the most significant factors that affect our financial performance and results of operations are as follows:      UK and Italian
Government Feed-in-Tariff and Blade Supply Impact on Near-term Results      In December 2015, the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change
announced a 40% reduction to the feed-in-tariff for wind turbines ranging in capacity from 50-100 kW. This reduction became effective on February 8, 2016. In addition a deployment cap of 300 kW per quarter was introduced limiting the amount of
turbines, ranging in capacity from 50-100 kW, to be installed to three units per quarter. The change to the feed-in-tariff and deployment cap as enacted has had a negative impact on orders in the U.K. market in the remainder of 2016, and a
corresponding adverse effect on our financial results during 2016.    In a publication in June 2016, the Italian authorities extended the feed-in-tariff
until December 31, 2016 with an ability to grid connect turbines and an eligibility to the current feed-in-tariff until June 30, 2017.    Our
revenue during 2015 was negatively impacted by our primary supplier of blades ceasing operations, which occurred in February 2015, and our resulting decision to transition to two new suppliers. We continue to work with our suppliers to manage the
cost, capacity and quality of our blade supply.      Foreign Currency Fluctuations Could Impact Profitability    
 A substantial amount of our business in 2016 is expected to be non-U.S. dollar denominated sales transactions, which we currently expect to be predominantly
denominated in euros. This can result in a significant proportion of our receivables being denominated in foreign currencies. While a majority of our costs will be in the U.S. dollar, we do incur a portion of our costs in euros, Chinese renminbi,
Canadian dollars, Swiss francs and British pounds. In addition, we expect to be entering into extended duration operations and maintenance contracts, which would obligate us to perform services in the future based upon currently negotiated non-U.S.
dollar  
      24

denominated pricing terms. Although we are pursuing economic hedging strategies, including increasing our euro-denominated costs and entering into euro-based forward contracts, there can be no
assurance that we can execute these strategies to effectively control the economic exposure of currency movements. Negative movements in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, such as those recently affecting the euro,
could have an adverse effect on our revenues and delay our achieving profitability.      Our Ability to Source and Manage Working
Capital Requirements      Our business operations require significant working capital. Our operating results and future growth depend on our ability to
optimize the working capital cycle time and to source adequate working capital commensurate with the size of our business. Some of our suppliers require us to make prepayments in advance of shipment. We have currently started providing our customers
with alternative payment options, such as letters of guarantee. Historically, we have managed to optimize our working capital cycle time and to source the required working capital from banks and capital financings.  
   Government Policies Including Incentives, Tariffs, Taxes and Duties Affecting the Wind Power Sector    
 Government incentives continue to be one of the main drivers for developing wind energy technology and increasing capacity. Although government support
programs differ from country to country, a number of countries have implemented incentive schemes, thus providing various types of subsidies and long-term tariffs to wind power developers. Historically, we and our customers have benefited from
fiscal benefits applicable to investments in the wind power industry by federal, state and local governments in the U.S. and Europe. Changes in these policies have affected, and will continue to affect, the investment plans of our customers and us,
as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.    Currently there are certain feed-in-tariff regimes in Italy and the U.K.
supporting the installation and operation of our distributed-class wind turbines. Published information from the U.K. indicates that the feed-in-tariff rates will decline further on a quarterly basis and the current deployment cap for wind turbines
between 50 kW to 100 kW has been over-subscribed. It is expected that the Italian authorities will introduce a new feed-in-tariff law shortly covering the period between 2017 and 2020.  
 Our third generation distributed turbine offers customers meaningfully improved economics that make the turbines more relevant for regions that do not have
economic incentives. As we continue sales in our core markets we expect to continue to expand our product offering and sales force to increase our sales in other regions.  
   Demand for Renewable Energy and Specifically for Wind Power Energy    
 Changes in prices of oil, coal, natural gas and other conventional energy sources influence the demand for electricity and for renewable energy sources. Our
business expansion and revenue growth has depended, and will continue to depend, on demand for renewable energy, specifically wind power energy products and future growth of the wind turbine market which will be affected by the growth of the global
and regional economies, the stability of financial markets and the ability of wind turbine manufacturers to further expand production capacity and reduce manufacturing costs.  
 In addition to competition from other industry participants and to traditional fossil fuel sources, we face competition from other renewable energy sources
such as solar power. The competition depends on the resources available within the specific markets. Although the cost to produce clean, reliable, wind energy is becoming more competitive, we must also compete with the production of solar power,
hydroelectric, geothermal, and other forms of renewable energy. However, deregulation, legislative mandates for renewable energy, and consumer preference for environmentally more benign energy sources are becoming important factors in increasing the
development of wind energy projects.      Wind Turbine Sales to Customers    
 We began commercial delivery of our platform of distributed-class wind turbines in 2008. We recognize revenue based on the value of the turbine product when
title is transferred assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Consequently, our results of operations have been and will continue to be significantly affected by the number of units of wind turbines we sell and the timing
of revenue recognition on such sales at any given period. In addition, since certain of our wind turbine products are sold at different prices and we are developing other models of wind turbines, we expect changes to our product mix will also affect
our results of operations and margins.      Development of the Distributed Wind Market    
 Applications for distributed energy, and as a subset distributed wind, continue to evolve globally. Many regions of the world have notable proportions of their
population with either no access to electrical power or with unstable power access. It is important to the growth of our business to have offerings that are well suited to support such distributed energy needs. We expect to continue to invest in
both research and development to refine our distributed-class turbine offerings as well as in our sales force to develop opportunities globally for the sales of our turbines.  
      25  

Table of Contents  

    International Expansion    
 We intend to invest in the expansion of our international sales and marketing efforts as we see opportunities for us to expand direct turbine sales, and
technology licensing and development offerings. Certain regions are expanding wind power as a source of energy driven either by the natural cost of energy in such regions or by certain incentive regimes. We currently derive a significant proportion
of our revenues outside of the U.S., and we expect this to continue. We currently intend to increase our sales and marketing investment on targeted regions with strong wind resources within any of Asia, Europe, and North America.  
   Pricing of Wind Turbines      Pricing
of our wind turbines is principally affected by the overall demand and supply in the wind power equipment industry and by the average wind turbine manufacturing cost. We price our wind turbines with reference to the prevailing market prices when we
enter into sales contracts with our customers, taking into consideration our estimated costs and an appropriate expected gross profit margin.  
   Prices of Raw Materials and Components and Their Availability    
 Raw materials and components used in the production of our wind turbines are sourced from domestic suppliers as well as international suppliers, and their
prices are dependent on various factors in addition to supply and demand. The fluctuations in prices of such raw materials and components and their availability will affect our operating results. In addition, the primary raw materials used in some
of our components include steel and copper. Consequently, the prices we pay to our suppliers for such components may be affected by movements in prices for these raw materials. 
 We generally engage two suppliers for each of our major components to minimize the dependency on any single supplier. We currently have certain critical
components for which we only have a single source supplier. As noted above, the primary supplier of blades for our distributed-class turbines ceased operations in February 2015, and the resulting supply constraint had an adverse effect on our
revenues. We continue to work with our suppliers to manage the cost, capacity and quality of our blade supply.      Ability to Design
and Market Technologically Advanced and Cost-Competitive Turbine Models      Although we have successfully launched three generations of our
distributed-class wind turbines, our operating results and future growth depend on our ability to continue to develop and license technologies, and market technologically advanced and cost competitive wind turbines. We expect to continue to optimize
the performance of our products under diverse operating conditions such as in low and high temperatures, low wind velocity and coastal areas, as well as reduce the cost of our offerings. Our ability to design and develop new products that meet these
changing requirements has been and will continue to be critical to our ability to maintain and increase our installed capacity sold and profitability. As a result, we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development,
particularly with respect to designing and developing more technologically advanced and cost-competitive products and core components.  
   Seasonality in Our Operations    
 Wind turbine sales in the regions in which we currently sell our turbines are affected by seasonal variations and the timing of government incentive
structures. To satisfy the delivery schedules, we manufacture most of our wind turbines during the second and third quarters of each year for delivery and installation in the third and fourth quarters. This schedule is due primarily to the weather
conditions, which are more favorable in these quarters for installation in northern areas to which we supply most of our wind turbines. We expect that the seasonality will gradually lessen as we obtain more purchase orders for sale of wind turbines
in additional geographies.      Investment in People    
 As of September 30, 2016, we had 80 full-time employees, a decrease of 29 employees, or approximately 27%, from September 30, 2015. We continuously
align our workforce to our business needs, with a focus on retaining our high-performing personnel in order to continue to develop, sell and market our products and services and manage our business.

   Basis of Presentation   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the
instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements and, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the
Company s 2015 consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (File No. 000-55184). The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015 was derived from the Company s annual audited financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and
amount of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses reported and disclosed. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates. All adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary
for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods, have been recorded. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates. Due to differing business conditions and seasonality, operating results for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in subsequent quarters or for the full year ending December 31, 2016.  
  Share-based Compensation     We previously had four equity
incentive plans. As a result of the RTO all of these plans were converted in substance to the Northern Power Systems Corp. 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan ( 2014 NPS Corp Plan ), which was adopted in April 2014. The 2014 NPS Corp Plan
provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory share options, and other types of share awards to our officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants. 4,000,000 common shares are reserved for issuance upon the grant or
exercise of awards under this plan.     Significant Accounting Estimates   
 We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effects of any necessary adjustments
prior to their publication. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of consolidated financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and
changes to estimates could occur in the near term. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We use estimates and assumptions in accounting for the following significant
matters, among others: revenue recorded from licensing and development agreements; realizability of accounts receivable; and valuation of inventory, goodwill and long-lived assets, warranty reserves, deferred income tax assets, share-based
compensation and contingencies.      Results of Operations of the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015       Overview     Our general
activity during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily focused on: growing revenue, orders and backlog of distributed wind turbines in key markets, especially Italy and the United States; continued expansion of order backlog
for FlexPhase power conversion technology used in battery-energy-storage and microgrid applications; expansion of services offerings to include full turnkey wind turbine installations, optimizing our supply chain and operating profile to improve our
margins, and monetizing our utility assets.    Our general activity during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily focused on:
expanding our order backlog of distributed turbines in key European markets, especially in Italy; optimizing our supply chain and operating profile to improve our margins; and continuing to expand our technology licensing and development business.
     Revenue, Orders and Deferred Revenue (dollars in millions)    
 Total revenues from Product Sales and Service, Technology Licensing and Technology Development decreased by $1.3 million, or 10%, to $12.1 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 from $13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our overall backlog decreased to approximately $26 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $39 million at
September 30, 2015. Our backlog of orders generally, but not always, converts to revenue for us within a one year period. The timing of such revenue recognition is impacted by customer specific installation conditions such as site
preparation and readiness by local utilities for grid connection.    A comparison of our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 is as follows:  
      27  

Table of Contents  

Product Sales and Service   
 Product sales and service revenue increased by $0.7 million to $11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $11.0 million for
the same period in 2015. The increase in our Product Sales and Service revenue was primarily attributed to recognizing higher revenue on service revenue and non-turbine products of $1.6 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $1.3 million and $0.0 million for the same period of 2015. Revenues from our distributed-class turbines increased $0.1 million to $9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to $9.7 million or the three months ended September 30, 2015.    During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we executed 21 new
distributed-class turbine sales orders. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we executed 42 new distributed-class turbine sales orders. Our deferred revenue balance associated with Product Sales and Service at September 30,
2016 was $4.4 million which is included in the backlog value disclosed above. At September 30, 2015, such balance was $9.6 million.  
  Technology Licensing Revenue     Technology licensing
revenue decreased by $1.0 million to $0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.0 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease is attributed to recognizing $0 million in royalty fees related to our licensing
agreement with a significant customer, as compared to $1.0 million in the same period for 2015, as our customer shipped 0 units in the third quarter of 2016. Our deferred revenue balance associated with Technology Licensing was $0 million as of
September 30, 2016 and 2015.     Technology Development Revenue   
 Technology development revenue decreased by $1.0 million to $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.4 million for the same
period in 2015 due to a reduction in development work for a significant customer. Our total deferred revenue balance associated with Technology Development was $0.1 million as of September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2015, such balance
was $0 million.      Cost of Goods Sold and Cost of Service Revenues (dollars in millions)    
 Cost of goods sold and cost of services revenues collectively remained consistent at $10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the same period in 2015.    A comparison of our costs of goods sold and cost of services for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 is as follows:      
    Product Sales and Service Cost of Goods and Costs of Service Sold   
      28  

Table of Contents  

  Product sales and service cost for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.6 million
to $10.0 million from $9.4 million for the same period in 2015. The increase is attributable to recognizing cost of sale on 4 more units in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. These
increases in cost were offset by certain cost reduction efforts and lower costs from non-turbine sales. Our cost of goods sold was $9.1 million for product sales along with $0.9 million of related service costs for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and $8.3 million for product sales and $1.1 million for related service costs for the same period in 2015.     Technology
Development Cost of Service     Technology development cost of services for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.5 million
to $0 million from $0.5 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease is related to decreased development activity with other parties.  
  Unallocated     The costs from unallocated expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $0.1 million to $0.1 million compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2015.  
   Segment Gross Profit (Loss) (dollars in millions)        
    Product Sales and Service   
 Gross profit from product sales and service for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.1 million to a profit of $1.7 million
compared to a profit of $1.6 million for the same period in 2015. This change was principally due to the $0.7 million increase in revenues of product sales more than offsetting the $0.6 million increase in cost of product sales for the three months
ended September 30, 2016.     Technology Licensing   
 Gross profit from technology licensing for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $1.0 million to a loss of $0 million from
$1.0 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease is principally due to lower revenue recognition in 2016 from third party licensing and royalty arrangements offset by lower related cost of sales.  
  Technology Development     Gross profit from technology
development for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.5 million to $0.4 million from a loss of $0.9 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease is related to decreased development activity with other parties.  
  Unallocated     Gross loss from unallocated expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.1 million compared to $0.2 million from the same period in 2015.

    Operating Expenses    
  Research and Development Expenses     Research and
development expenses decreased by $0.1 million or 14% to $0.6 million from $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease reflects success of cost cutting efforts enacted at
the end of 2015 and during 2016.     Sales and Marketing   
 Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $0.1 million or 11% to $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.9 million for the
same period in 2015. This decrease was driven primarily from cost cutting efforts enacted over the past year.     General and Administrative Expenses
    General and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million or 13% to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.6 million for
the same period in 2015. This increase related to an increase in severance of $0.6 million partially offset by decreases in compensation and benefits of $0.2 million and other general and administrative cost of $0.2 million primarily from cost
cutting efforts enacted over the past year.      Income/(loss) from Operations    
 Our loss from operations decreased by $1.2 million to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0 million for the same
period in 2015. The decreased income is principally due to lower gross profit of $1.3 million offset by a decrease in operating expenses primarily from cost cutting efforts.  
   Segment Income (Loss) from Operations (dollars in millions)    
   
    Product Sales and Service   
 Income from operations from product sales and service for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $0.5 million to $1.0 million compared
to $0.5 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in income is principally due to $0.1 million increase in gross profit and a $0.4 million decrease in operating expenses.  
  Technology Licensing     Income from operations from
technology licensing for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.9 million to a loss of $0 million compared to income of $0.9 million for the same period in 2015, due to a decrease in gross profit of $1.0 million from
revenue license fees and royalties under our 2.X license agreement offsetting a decrease of $0.1 million in operating expenses.     Technology
Development     Income from operations from technology development for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.5 million to
$0.4 million compared to $0.9 million for the same period in 2015, due to a reduction in development work for a significant customer.     Shared
Services     Corporate shared general and administrative loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.1 million to
$1.5 million compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2015 principally due to decreased consulting fees and other cost cutting efforts.

   Unallocated   
 The loss from unallocated expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.4 million to $1.1 million compared to $0.7 million
in the same period in 2015 due to increased severance expense of $0.6 million offset by a reduction in stock compensation of $0.2 million.    The table
below breaks out the unallocated expenses by category for the periods reported   (dollars in millions)  .      
     Other Expense and Income Tax Expense    
 Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $0.1 million to $0.1 million compared to $0.2 million in the same period in 2015.
This decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in foreign currency loss expense in the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same time period in 2015.  
 Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $0.3 million to $0.1 million compared to $0.4 million in 2015. The $0.3
million reduction in income tax is primarily from lower Brazilian tax expense incurred on certain license and royalty revenue earned in Brazil in 2016 as compared to 2015.  
   Net Loss      Net loss increased by
$0.9 million or 179%, to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from a net loss of $0.5 million in the same period in 2015.  
 The increase in our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily due to the increase in loss from operations of $1.2 million
offsetting a reduction in income tax expense of $0.3 million and $0.1 million for other expenses when compared to the same time period in 2015.  
   Non-GAAP Measures      Generally, a
non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated
and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures included in this Form 10-Q, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. We utilize the
non-GAAP measure of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA which we define as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash compensation expense, changes in the fair valuation of certain liability classified instruments, and
certain other one-time non-cash charges.      Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (dollars in millions)

Table of Contents  

  Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and income
of $0.2 million for the same period in 2015. The change in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss for the period ending September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to an increase in net loss of $0.9 million offset by lower income tax expense of $0.3
million and other expenses of $0.1 million as compared to the same period in 2015.      Results of Operations of the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015       Overview   
 Our general activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily focused on: growing revenue, orders and backlog of distributed wind
turbines in key markets, especially Italy and the United States; continued expansion of order backlog for FlexPhase power conversion technology used in battery-energy-storage and microgrid applications; expansion of services offerings to include
full turnkey wind turbine installations, and optimizing our supply chain and operating profile to improve our margins, and monetizing our utility assets.  
 Our general activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily focused on: expanding our order backlog of distributed turbines in key
European markets, especially in Italy; stabilizing our supply chain for blades with two new suppliers; continued support of our release of our third generation products turbine which is projected to reduce our cost of the turbine while increasing
energy capture; optimizing our supply chain and operating profile to improve our margins; and continuing to expand our technology licensing and development business. In addition, we pursued an equity capital raise in the first quarter; however, due
to then current market conditions, we decided not to complete this capital raise at that time.      Revenue, Orders and Deferred Revenue
(dollars in millions)      Total revenues from Product Sales and Service, Technology Licensing and Technology Development decreased by $9.7 million, or
27%, to $25.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $35.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our overall backlog decreased by 33% to approximately $26 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to
approximately $39 million at September 30, 2015. Our backlog of orders generally, but not always, converts to revenue for us within a one year period. The timing of such revenue recognition is impacted by customer specific installation
conditions such as site preparation and readiness by local utilities for grid connection.    A comparison of our revenues for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:      
    Product Sales and Service   
 Product sales and service revenue decreased by $3.8 million to $24.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $28.4 million for the
same period in 2015. The decrease in our Product Sales and Service revenue was primarily attributed to recognizing lower revenue on sales of our distributed-class turbines which totaled $20.5 million along with a decrease in sales of our non-turbine
products which totaled $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $23.9 million and $0.9 million for turbines and non-turbine products, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Declines
in the distributed class and non  turbine revenue were exacerbated by a $0.9 million decrease in utility scale turbine revenue resulting from the sale of a prototype 2.2 MW unit during 2015. Related service revenue totaled $3.6 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $2.7 million for the same period in 2015.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we
executed 86 new distributed-class turbine sales orders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we executed 113 new distributed-class turbine sales orders. Our deferred revenue balance associated with Product Sales and Service at
September 30, 2016 was $4.4 million which is included in the backlog value disclosed above. At September 30, 2015, such balance was $9.6 million.

   Technology Licensing Revenue   
 Technology licensing revenue decreased by $3.5 million to $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.9 million for the same period
in 2015. This decrease is attributed to recognizing $0.4 million royalty revenues related to our licensing agreement with a significant customer, as the customer shipped fewer units in 2016. Our deferred revenue balance associated with
Technology Licensing was consistent at $0 million as of September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.     Technology Development Revenue
    Technology development revenue decreased by $2.4 million to $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.4 million for the
same period in 2015. This decrease is attributed to a reduction in development work related to a contract with a significant customer. Our total deferred revenue balance associated with Technology Development was $0.1 million as of
September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2015, such balance was $0 million.      Cost of Goods Sold and Cost of Service
Revenues (dollars in millions)      Cost of goods sold and cost of services revenues collectively decreased by $4.9 million or 17% in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 to $23.7 million as compared to $28.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    A comparison of our costs
of goods sold and cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:      
    Product Sales and Service Cost of Goods and Costs of Service Sold   
 Product sales and service cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $4.0 million to $23.0 million from $27.0 million for the same
period in 2015. The decrease in product sales and service cost is primarily attributed to the recognition of a lower volume related to our distributed-class turbine sales and decreased sales of non-turbine products for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Declines in distributed class and non-turbine product sales and services cost were exacerbated by a $0.9 million decrease in utility scale turbine cost resulting from the sale of a
prototype 2.2MW unit during the first quarter of 2015. Our cost of goods sold was $20.7 million for product sales along with $2.3 million of related service costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $24.3 million for product sales
and $2.7 million for related service costs for the same period in 2015.     Technology Licensing Cost of Service   
 Technology licensing cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.2 million to $0.1 million from $0.3 million
for the same period in 2015. The decrease reflects reduced costs associated with license revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015.  
  Technology Development Cost of Service     Technology
development cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.6 million to $0.2 million from $0.8 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease is related to decreased activity related to development
of a 3.3 MW turbine and a decrease in development activity with other parties.

   Unallocated   
 The costs from unallocated expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.1 million to $0.4 million from $0.5 million for the same
period in 2015. This reflects lower depreciation and amortization cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  
   Segment Gross Profit (Loss) (dollars in millions)        
    Product Sales and Service   
 Gross profit from product sales and service for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.2 million to $1.6 million compared to $1.4
million for the same period in 2015. This change was principally due to a decrease in sales of distributed-class turbines and non-turbine products of $3.8 million for the nine months end September 30, 2016, that was offset by a larger
decrease in cost of goods sold of $4.0 million, principally due lower blade and supplier transition cost in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015.  
  Technology Licensing     Gross profit from technology
licensing for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $3.3 million to $0.3 million from $3.6 million for the same period in 2015. This change is principally due to lower revenue recognition of $3.5 million in 2016 from
third party licensing and royalty arrangements partial offset by lower related cost of sales.     Technology Development   
 Gross profit from technology development for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $1.8 million to $0.8 million compared to $2.6
million for the same period in 2015, principally due to lower revenues from contract technology development services provided to a significant customer and other third parties in 2015.  
  Unallocated     Loss from unallocated expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.1 million to $0.4 million from $0.5 million for the same time period in 2015, principally due to lower depreciation and amortization expense in 2016.  
   Operating Expenses       Research and Development
Expenses     Research and development expenses decreased by $0.5 million or 19% to $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to $2.7 million for the same time period in 2015. The decrease reflects the success of cost cutting efforts enacted at the end of 2015 and 2016.  
  Sales and Marketing     Sales and marketing expenses
decreased by $0.8 million or 24% to $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.4 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease is principally due to $0.4 million reduction in employee and consulting expenses and
consulting expenses along with $0.4 million in sales and marketing expenses from cost cutting efforts enacted during 2015.     General and Administrative
Expenses

  General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.6 million or 24% to $5.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from $6.7 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease is principally due to a $0.6 million reduction in capital raising expenses, $0.6 reduction in compensation and benefits, $0.4 reduction in professional and
consulting fees and $0.6 million reduction in other G A expenses resulting from successful cost cutting efforts partially offset by an increase in severance expenses of $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
same period in 2015.      Loss from Operations    
 Our loss from operations increased by $1.9 million to $7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.7 million for the same
period in 2015.      Segment Income (Loss) from Operations (dollars in millions)    
   
    Product Sales and Service   
 Loss from operations from product sales and service for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.7 million to a loss of 1.7 million
compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2015, principally due to an increase in gross profit of $0.2 million and lower operating expenses of $0.5 million.  
  Technology Licensing     Income from operations from
technology licensing for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $2.8 million to income of $0.2 million compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2015, due to a decrease in gross profit of $3.3 million from decreased revenue
from license fees and royalties under our 2.X license agreement, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  Technology Development     Income from operations from
technology development for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $1.9 million to $0.7 million compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2015, due to a decrease in gross profit of $1.8 million from decreased
development revenue and a $0.1 million increase in operating expense in 2016.     Shared Services   
 Corporate shared general and administrative loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $2.3 million to $4.7 million compared to
$7.0 million for the same period in 2015 principally due to $0.6 million decrease in cost related to an uncompleted capital raise, a $0.5 decrease in consulting and professional fees, a $0.4 decrease in compensation and benefits cost,
recruiting expenses of $0.2 million, a decrease in legal expenses of $0.2 million and a decrease in other corporate and shared services expenses of $0.4 million.  
  Unallocated     The loss from unallocated expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.2 million to $2.1 million from $1.9 million as compared to the same period in 2015 principally due to $0.1 million reduction in gross profit loss, $0.3 million decrease in compensation and
benefits offsetting $0.6 increase in severance expense.    The table below breaks out the unallocated expenses by category for the periods reported
  (dollars in millions)  .

Other Expense and Income Tax Expense    
 Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.1 million to $0.3 million from $0.4 million as compared to the same
time period in 2015. This decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in foreign currency loss expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the same time period in 2015.  
 Income tax expense decreased by $0.9 million to $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The
decrease is the result of lower Brazilian tax expense incurred on certain license and royalty revenue earned in Brazil in 2016 as compared to 2015.  
   Net Loss      Net loss increased by
$0.9 million or 13%, to $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from a net loss of $7.2 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily due to
the increase in loss from operations of $1.9 million offsetting a decrease in income tax expense of $0.9 million and other expenses of $0.1 million.  
   Non-GAAP Measures      Generally, a
non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated
and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measure prepared in accordance
with GAAP. We utilize the non-GAAP measure of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA which we define as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash compensation expense, changes in the fair valuation of certain liability
classified instruments, and certain other one-time non-cash charges.

    Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (dollars in millions)    
   
   Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $5.2 million for the
same period in 2015. The change in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss is primarily attributable to an increase in net loss $0.9 million for the period ending September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources       Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows Data (dollars in millions)        
     Cash and Cash Equivalents    
 As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 million of which $0.3 million was held by a foreign holding company and
subsidiaries. We had cash and cash equivalents of $5.7 million of which $0.3 million was held by a foreign subsidiary for the same period in 2015.  
 We have experienced recurring operating losses, had an accumulated deficit of $176.5 million. In addition, we have experienced recurring negative operating
cash flows, which have resulted in a decrease in our cash balance. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this
outcome of this uncertainty.    A substantial amount of our business in 2016 is expected to be non-U.S. dollar denominated sales transactions, which we
currently expect to be predominantly denominated in euros. We are pursuing economic hedging strategies, including increasing our euro-denominated costs and entering into euro-based forward contracts, however there can be no assurance that we can
execute these strategies to effectively control the economic exposure of currency movements.

    Operating Activities    
 Cash used in operating activities consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, impairment losses,
share-based compensation, and changes in working capital and other activities. In addition to the increase in net loss, cash used in operations increased as described below as a result of working capital needs.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities decreased by $4.2 million to $2.0 million from $6.2 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash used in operating activities for 2016 is primarily due to the net loss incurred partially offset by the effect of changes in assets and liabilities resulting in a cash inflow of
$6.1 million. Included in these changes were a decrease of $5.7 million in deferred cost, an increase in customer deposits of $3.2 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.1 million, offset by a $5.3 decrease in deferred revenue, and an
increase in other balance sheet accounts $0.4 million. These changes in cash from operations were offset by $1.0 million payments on the revolving line of credit.  
   Investing Activities      Net cash
used in investing activities was $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2015. Cash used in investing activities consisted of purchasing certain equipment required to maintain
operations.      Financing Activities    
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $1.0 compared to net cash provided of $0 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. We had repayments of $5.1 million and borrowings of $4.1 million on our working capital revolving line of credit for the period ended September 30, 2016.  
   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any such arrangements at September 30, 2016.      Contractual
Obligations      As described below, our long-term debt obligations were zero as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We have $1.9
million outstanding on our working capital revolving line of credit and a $0 million outstanding performance letter of credit and warranty guarantee, as of September 30, 2016, which is described below in the Comerica Credit Facility section. In
addition, we have leased our headquarters and production facility which expires in June of 2019. Effective as of the second anniversary of the lease commencement (June 19, 2014), we have an annual right to terminate the lease without penalty. If we
do not exercise our right to terminate the lease they have a total outstanding obligation of $2.1 million. We have not exercised the right to cancel the lease as of September 30, 2016.  
   Comerica Credit Facility      Our
working capital line of credit is $2.0 million. This line is guaranteed by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, as well as by certain collateralized assets. As of September 30, 2016, we had $1.9 million outstanding on the working capital revolving line
of credit. At September 30, 2016, we had a net maximum supported borrowing base of $0.1 remaining. In September 2016, we amended our foreign working capital revolving line of credit with Comerica to extend the maturity date of
September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2017. The line of credit was reduced from $6.0 million to $2.0 million, with the available borrowing base being limited to the amount of collateral available at the time the line is drawn. The Company
elected to reduce the amount to borrow under the line as a result of improvements in managing our working capital needs, specifically inventory management. All other significant terms of the line of credit remained the same. The renegotiated loan
agreement with Comerica contains a financial covenant which requires us to maintain unencumbered liquid assets having a value of at least $1.0 million at all times To facilitate certain financing arrangements that our Italian customers have with
third parties, we have agreed to provide performance and warranty letters of credit to such customers. The performance letters of credit are payable if we fail to meet contractual terms such as delivery schedules. Such letters of credit decreased
the borrowing base by 25% of the face value. The warranty letter of credit guarantees uptime and power curve performance over a one year period starting at commissioning date. Such letters of credit decreased the borrowing base by 100% less the
amount of cash collateral held by the bank to secure warranty letters of credit. At September 30, 2016, there were no such performance and warranty guarantees outstanding.  
 The loan agreement with Comerica contains a financial covenant which requires us to maintain unencumbered liquid assets having a value of at least $1.0
million at all times. At September 30, 2016, we had unencumbered liquid assets having a value of $5.4 million.    The loan agreement also contains
various covenants that limit or prohibit our ability, among other things, to:      

incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of September 30, 2016. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
 As more fully set forth in Part II Item 9A,  Controls and Procedures,  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015 because we had inadequate and ineffective controls for reviewing and analyzing revenue
transactions related to certain international turbine sales that remained in logistics warehouses while certain logistics events were completed. We also had inadequate and ineffective controls for reviewing and analyzing complex or non-routine
transactions. The Company continues to make enhancements to existing internal controls, improve the quality and timing of the accounting close process and is in the process of assessing the resource needs of the department and engaging the
appropriate accounting and financial expertise. Further work, however, is required to develop appropriate operational and procedural controls and in our review process to provide reasonable assurance that our financial controls over financial
reporting are designed in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Therefore, while we believe these changes reduce the risk of financial statement misstatement, there continues to be additional work required for us to conclude that
reasonable assurance has been obtained that certain controls are operating effectively and in a timely manner. We expect to continue to undertake these actions as appropriate throughout 2016.  
 In connection with the closing of our second quarter of 2016, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
Specifically, our inventory reconciliation control was not properly designed as it did not include the reconciliation of all non-system generated entries recorded to the general ledger. The material weakness resulted in material misstatements of our
inventory and costs of revenues balances and related disclosures, which were corrected in that filing. We have implemented changes to remediate this control deficiency, but for the near-term future, the matter described above will continue to
constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that could result in material misstatements in our financial statements not being prevented or detected.  
 The Audit Committee is monitoring management s continuing development and implementation of its remediation plan. In addition, under the direction of the
Audit Committee, management will continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of our internal control environment, as well as the continued development of policies and procedures to improve the overall effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting.    Management is committed to continuous improvement of our internal control processes and will continue to
diligently review our reporting controls and procedures. As management continues to evaluate and work to improve internal control over financial reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies to modify, or in
appropriate circumstances not to complete, certain of the remediation measures. We expect our remediation efforts will continue throughout 2016.  
      39  

Table of Contents  

  Based on the evaluation of our financial reporting controls, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer concluded that, our financial reporting controls were not effective as of September 30, 2016. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of
time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.     Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting     There have been no material changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

filed its 2015 Form 10-K on July 25, 2016 and its  Q1-2016   Form 10-Q  on August 31, 2016. Upon the filing of the Q2-2016 Form 10-Q on September 14,
2016, we were up to date with our filings, and the FFCTO was subsequently lifted on September 16, 2016, at which point trading in the Company s securities resumed  
 Furthermore, in connection with our preparation of our financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2016, our management identified a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.    The material weakness pertained to our
inventory reconciliation which was not properly designed as it did not include the reconciliation of all non-system generated entries recorded to the general ledger. The material weakness resulted in a material misstatement of our inventory and
costs of revenues balances and related disclosures, which have been corrected in this filing. If additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future,
we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis, which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence or delisting and adversely affect the market
price of our common shares.

  Other Information       On April 13, 2016, on account of the Company s delay in filing its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 (2015 Form 10-K ), the Ontario Securities Commission ( OSC ) issued a Management Cease Trade Order ( MCTO ) temporarily halting trading in the
Company s shares by its CEO and CFO until such time as the Company s filings were up to date and the MCTO was lifted. On August 25, 2016, the staff of the OSC informed the Company that it would recommend converting the MCTO to a
Failure to File Cease Trading Order ( FFCTO ) if the Company did not, by August 31, 2016, file its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 (together, the  Quarterly
Reports ), each of which were delayed due to the delays in filing the 2015 Form 10-K. The Company filed its Quarterly Report for the quarter ending Mach 31, 2016 on August 31, 2016, but was unable to complete its Quarterly Report for the
quarter ending June 30, 2016 ( Q2 Quarterly Filing ) by that date. As a result, on September 2, 2016, the OSC issued an order converting the MCTO to a temporary Failure to File Cease Trading Order ( FFCTO ) pursuant to
which all trading of the Company shares will be suspended for as long as the FFCTO is in effect. Upon the filing of the Q2-2016 Form 10-Q on September 14, 2016, we were up to date with our filings, and the FFCTO was subsequently lifted on
September 16, 2016, at which point trading in the Company s securities resumed.    On September 7, 2016, our board of directors appointed Eric
Larson to serve as our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Mr. Larson has served as our Vice President and Corporate Controller since November 2014. Prior to joining Northern Power Systems Corp. Inc. he served as corporate controllers of
Spire Corporation. Mr. Larson has over 25 years of experience in finance and accounting. He has held financial leadership positions at various companies across a variety of sectors, including CMGI, Biogen Idec, Aspect Software and Ernst   Young.
Mr. Larson received his CPA certification in Massachusetts. He will serve as our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer in his role as Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. We are not making any changes to his current
compensation in connection with his appointment.
