(1) Significant Accounting Policies       Basis of Presentation  :  The accompanying unaudited C  onsolidated   F  inancial   S  tatements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring deferrals and accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  The operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  The Company has evaluated subsequent events for disclosure through the date of issuance of the accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements and there were no material subsequent events which require additional disclosure  , other than the definitive agreements to purchase the Food Lion Supermarket locations   and the Nell s Family Market location   as disclosed in Note (6)  .  For fur  ther information, refer to the Consolidated F  inancial   S  tatements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K  . 

(2) Current Relevant Accounting Standards 

In May 2014,   the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issue  d Accounting Standards Update (  ASU)   2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),   which amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.  ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services.  The standard was initially effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  In August 2015, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of the effective date of this new guidance resulting in it now being effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2018.    In March, April and May of 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, respectively,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   which amends the guidance in ASU 2014-09.    Early adoption is not permitted.  The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact   of adoption of the ASU  .    The Company expects that the adoption of the ASU will not have a significant impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)(Topic 718): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.    ASU 2014-15 provides guidance related to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going con  cern and to provide related   note disclosures.  The new requirements are effective for the annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods and annual periods thereafter.  Early adoption is permitted.  Adoption of the new ASU will not h  ave an impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial S  tatements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330):  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventor  y.  ASU 2015-11 amends guidance on the measurement of inventory from lower of cost or market to net realizable value.  The amendment applies to all inventory other than those measured by Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and the Retail Inventory Method (RIM).  The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is permitted.  Adoption of the new ASU will not h  ave a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial S  tatements. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.    ASU 2015-16 requires that any effect on earnings due to depreciation, amortization or other income effects, due to a change to the provisional amounts be recorded in the current period s financial statements as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The portion of the amount recorded in the current-period earnings, which would have been recorded in the previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date, must be presented separately on the face of the income statement or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements by line item.  The amendment is effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2015. The amendments are to be applied prospectively to any adjustments occurring after the effective date. Adoption of th  e   ASU   did not have a   current   impact on the Company s 2016 Consolidated Financial S  tatements.

(2) Current Relevant Accounting Standards (continued)  

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01   Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Fin  ancial Liabilities  .      ASU 2016-01 generally requires that equity investments (excluding equity method investments) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  ASU 2016-01 also modifies certain disclosure requirements related to financial assets and liabilities. Under existing GAAP, changes in fair value of available-for-sale equity investments are recorded in other comprehensive income.  The Company expects that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will likely have an impact on the net income reported in the Company s Consolidated Statements of   Income but it is not expected to significantly impact the Company s comprehensive income or shareholders  equity  .  The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with the cumulative effect of the adoption made to the balance sheet as of the date of adoption.      Adoption will result in a reclassification of the related accumulated unrealized appreciation, net of applicable deferred income taxes, currently included in accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings, resulting in no impact on the Company s shareholders  equity. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02   Leases (Topic 842).    ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by their leases with lease terms more than 12 months.  Current guidance only requires capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.  However, the ASU 2016-02 now requires that both capital and operating leases be recognized on the balance sheet.  The effect on cash flows will strictly depend on whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or capital lease.  The ASU 2016-02 will require disclosures to aid investors and other financial statement users to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of the cash flows arising from leases.  These disclosures are to include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.  This update   will have limited impacts on the accounting for leases by   lessors. However, new guidance contains targeted improvements to align, where necessary, the lessor s accounting with the lessee s accounting standards.  ASU 2016-02 will become effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods within those fiscal years.    Although the Company has not completed its assessment, the Company   expects that   the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have a significant impact on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04   Liabilities   Extinguishments of Liabilities (Suptopic 405-20) Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products.    ASU 2016-04 requires the debtor to derecognize a liability, such as a prepaid stored-value product, if and only if it has been extinguished by paying the creditor in cash, other financial assets, goods or services or if the debtor is relieved of its obligation legally, either judicially or by the creditor.  ASU 2016-04 also requires that an entity must disclose the methodology and specific judgements made in applying the breakage recognized.  ASU 2016-04 will become effective for the financial statements issued for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early application is permitted including adoption in an interim period.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating t  he impact of adoption of the ASU  .    The Company expects that the adoption of the ASU will not have a significant impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13   Financial Intruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.        The amendments in ASU 2016-13 replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in the current GAAP with requirements to reflect expected credit losses and   require   consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to form credit loss estimates.  The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Ea  rl  y adoption is permitted as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    ASU 2016-15 attempts to reduce diversity in practice in how cash receipts and cash payments are presented   and classified   in the statement of cash flows  .    This ASU provides guidance on eight specific   cash flow   issues.  The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted   including adoption in an interim period  .    The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU  .

The Company s marketable securities are all classified as available-for-sale   within      Current Assets      in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet  s  .    FASB   has established three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:    

Level 1  Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level 2  Observable inputs, other than Level 1 inputs in active markets, that are observable either directly     or indirectly; and 

Level 3  Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity     to develop its own assumptions. 

The Company s marketable securities   valued using Level 1 inputs include highly liquid equity securities, for which quoted market prices are available  .  The Company s   bond portfolio is valued using Level 2 inputs.    The Company s   municipal   bonds are valued using a combination of pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, cash flow models with yield curves and other pricing models utilizing observable inputs, which are considered Level 2 inputs. 

For Level 2 investment valuation, the Company utilizes standard pricing proced  ures of its investment   brokerage   firm(s) which include various third party pricing services.  These procedures also require specific price monitoring practices as well as pricing review reports, valuation oversight and pricing challenge procedures to maintain the most accurate representation of investment fair market value.  In addition, the Company engage  s   an independent firm to value a sample of the Company s municipal bond holdings   annually   in order to validate the investment s assigned fair value. 

The Company accrues interest on its   municipal   bond portfolio throughout the life of each bond held.  Dividends from the equity securities are recognized as received.  Both interest and dividends   are recognized in  Investment i  ncome   (loss) and interest expense    on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Marketable securities  , as of   September    2  4  , 201  6   and December 2  6  , 201  5  , consisted of:

The Company also maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan and a non-qualified pharmacist deferred compensation plan for certain of its associates which allows them   to defer income to future periods.  Participants in the plan  s   earn a return on their deferrals based on mutual fund investments.  The Company chooses to invest in the underlying mutual fund investments to offset the liability associated with   the   non-qualified deferred compensation plan  s  .  Such investments are reported on the   Company s Consolidated Balance S  heet  s   as      SERP   investment,    are classified as trading securities and are   measured   at fair value using Level 1 inputs wit  h gains and losses included in  I  nvestment income   (loss) and interest expense        on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income.

Weis Markets, Inc. assumed two lease obligations in the acquisition of the former Mars Super Market stores and entered into two new lease agreements.  Goodwill of $13.2 million has been recorded, based upon the expected benefits to be derived from   new management business strategy and cost synergies.

Income is earned by selling merchandise at price levels that produce revenues in excess of cost of merchandise sold and operating and administrative expenses.  Although the Company may experience short term fluctuations in its earnings due to unforeseen short-term operating cost increases, it historically has been able to increase revenues and maintain stable earnings from year to year. 

Net   Sales        The Company's   revenues are earned and cash is generated as merchandise is sold to customers at the point of sale.  Discounts provided to customers by the Company at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as products are sold or over the life of a promotional program if redeemable in the future.  Discounts provided by vendors, usually in the form of paper coupons, are not   recognized as a reduction in sales provided the coupons are redeemable at any retailer that accepts coupons. 

Total store   sal  es increased   4.4  % in the   third   quarter of 201  6  , compared to the same period in 201  5  .  Excluding fuel sales, total store sales increased   4  .8  %.  The   Compa  n  y s year-to-date   total store   sales increased   3.2  % compared   to the first   thirty-nine     weeks of 201  5  .  Excluding fuel sales, the Company s year-to-date total   store sales increased   3.4  % compared   to the first   thirty-nine   weeks of 201  5  .    The five former Mars Super Market stores and the ten former Food Lion, LLC stores improved sales for the third quarter by $15.0 million.  

When calculating the percentage change in comparable store sales, the Company defines a new store to be comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters  .  Relocated stores and stores with expanded square footage are included in comparable store sales since these units are located in existing markets and are open during construction.  Planned store dispositions are excluded from the calculation.  The Company only   includes retail food stores in the calculation. 

Comparable s  tore sales increased   2.7  % in the   third   quarter of 201  6   compared to the same quarter in 201  5  .  Excluding fuel sales, comparable store sales increased   3  .0  % in   the   third   quarter of 201  6   compared to the same   period in 201  5  .  The   Company s year-to-date comparable store   sales increased   2.7  % compared   t  o   the first   thirty-nine   weeks of 201  5  .  Excluding   fuel sales, comparable store sales increased   2.  9  %    compared   to the first   thirty-nine   weeks of 201  5  .       

The Company   attributes the increased sales to its continued   strategic pricing   investments   and ongoing improvement of its store assortment by market  .  This includes targeted promotional activity in key regional markets and its Everyday Lower Prices (EDLP) and Lowest Price Guarantee promotional programs.  Compared to the   third   quarter of 201  5  ,    the Company   experienced a   3.5   % decrease in   the average sales per customer transaction in the   third   quarter of 201  6  ,    while   identical customer store   visits increased by   6.1  %.  The   Company s year-to-  date average s  ales per customer transaction de  creased   2.3  %, while the number of identical customer store visits increased   5.1  % compared   to 201  5  . 

The Company s results also benefited from   improved     store level  ,   supply chain   and store support     efficiencies   to deliver a better   customer experience  , which increased customer traffic and overall market share  .    In addition  , the   Weis   Preferred Club Shopper program   continues to   target   customer members with personalized offers and digital coupons   to help them save money.    As part of this loyalty program, t  he Company   continues to   offer its "Gas Rewards" program in most markets.  The "Gas Rewards" program allows Weis Preferred Shoppers club card members to earn gas discounts resulting from their in-store purchases.  Customers can redeem these gas discounts at   any   of the thirty-one   Weis Gas-n-Go locations, as well as participating third-party   gas retail   locations such as   Sheetz   convenience stores, which are   located in most of the Company's markets.  

Comparable produce sales increased 6.5% and 5.2% in the third quarter and first thirty-nine weeks of 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.    T  he 2016 prod  uce sales increase can be attributed to expanding the vegetable options and the launch of the new Kid Zone program in the second quarter as well as aggressive advertising and well executed training programs.  A strong growing season resulted in consistent crop yields in the major growing regions.  In addition, the increase in produce sales is partially due to inflation in the third quarter of 2016.

Net Sales   (c  ontinued) 

Comparable deli and food service sales   increased 7.9% in the third quarter of 2016 and 8.7% year-to-date, compared to the same periods in 2015.  Although this category was impacted by deflation, the increase was also driven by expanded deli meat and cheese displays, expanded lunch options, the rotisserie chicken program, the Buy More Save more and EDLP programs and continued success in the Food Service Meal Solutions program. 

Comparable bakery sa  les increased   15.5  % in the   th  ir  d   quarter of 2016 and   12.9  % i  n the first   thirty  -  nine   weeks of 2016, compared to the same   periods   in 2015.  Bakery sales increased due to   the addition of new programs and   EDLPs  .          

Comparable pharmacy   sales increased   6.7  % and   8.7  % in the   third   quarter and   first   thirty-nine weeks   of   201  6  , respectively, compared to the same periods in 201  5  .    The pharmacy sales increase was driven by an increased number of filled prescriptions,   primarily   due to   an   increased acceptance of   additional   preferred third-party insurance plans as well as expanded pharmacy hours  . 

Comparable dairy sales decreased 4.0% and 1.9% in the third quarter and the first thirty-nine weeks of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015.  This decrease is primarily due to deflation in 2016. 

Comparable meat sales decreased 0.5% in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2016 compared to the first thirty-nine weeks of 2015.  The 2016 decrease in meat sales can be attributed to deflation,   which was partially   offset by an increase in units   sold  . 

Comparable   fuel   sales decreased   9.9  %   and   11.  0  % in the   third   quarter and first   thirty  -  nine   weeks of 201  6  , respectively, compared to the same periods in   201  5  .       F  uel sales decrease  d     as a result of the decline   in retail fuel prices.  According   to the U.S. Department of Energy, the thirteen week average price of gasoline in the Central   Atlantic States decreased   12.  6  % or $  0.  3  5   per gallon in the   third     quarter of 201  6  , compared to the same   quarter in 201  5  .  Year-to-date, the average price of gasoline in the Centra  l Atlantic States decreased   14.  1  % or $  0.  38   per ga  llon, compared   to the   first   thirty-nine   weeks   of 201  5  .    As an offset, the year-to-date gallons sold have increased   2.  9  %    compared to 2015 as a result of a strong gas rewards program. 

Management remains confident in its ability to generate   sales growth in a   highly competitive environment, but also understands some competitors have greater financial resources and could use these resources to   take measures which could adversely affect the Company's competitive position. 

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit     Cost of sales consists of direct product costs (net of discounts and allowances), distribution center and transportation costs, as well as manufacturing facility operations.        Almost   all of the increase in cost of sales in   201  6   as compared to 201  5     wa  s due to the increased sales volume in 201  6  .      Both direct product cost and distribution cost increase when sales volume increases. 

According to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics    report, the annual Seasonally Adjusted Food  -at-Home Consumer Price Index de  creased   0.  7  % compared to an increase of   2.  0  % for the same period last year.  Even though   the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  index rates may be reflective of a trend, it will not necessarily be indicative of the Company s   actual results.    T  he Company has achieved a gro  ss profit rate of   27.6  % and 2  7  .  8  %   for the   quarter and year-to-date, respectively, compared to   a gross profit   rate of 27.  3  %    and 27.  5  %    for   the quarter and year-to-date  ,    respectively,   in 201  5  . The   year-to-date   increase in gross profit r  ate was driven by a shift in   sales mix from fuel   sales   to grocery sales which carry a higher profit margin.

Cost of Sales and Gross Profit   (c  ontinued) 

The Company's profitability is impacted   by the cost of oil.  Fluctuating fuel prices affect the delivered cost of product and the cost of other petroleum-based supplies. As a percentage of sales, the cost of diesel fuel used by the Company to deliver goods from its distribution   center to its stores decreased 0.  02  % in the   third     quarter and   decreased 0.04%   in the first   thirty-nine   weeks of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.  Although the Company experien  ced a decrease in   these costs,   the decline was minimized due to higher fuel usage resulting from more store deliveries to   supply the recently acquired stores and   meet the higher sales demand.  According   to the U.S. Department of Energy, the thirteen week average diesel fuel price for the Central Atlantic States in the   third   quarter of 2016 was $2.4  8   per gallon compared to $  2.86   per gallon in the same period in 2015 for an average decrease of   13.3  % or $  0.38   per gallon.  The   201  6    thirty-nine   week average diesel fuel price for the Central Atlantic States was $2.3  9   per gallon compared to $3.  0  6 per gallon in the same period   in   2015 for an average decrease of   22.1  % or $  0.6  7   per gallon.  Based   upon the U.S. Energy   Information Administration s current projections, the Company is expecting diesel fuel prices to remain fairly steady through  out   the   fourth   quarter   of   2016. 

Although the Company experienced product cost inflation and deflation in various commodities   for both quarters presented, management cannot accurately measure the full impact of inflation or deflation on retail pricing due to changes in the types of merchandise sold between periods, shifts in customer buying patterns and the fluctuation of competitive factors. 

Operating, General and Administrative Expenses     Business operating costs including expenses generated from administration and purchasing functions, are recorded in "Operating, general and administrative expenses."  Business operating costs include items such as wages, benefits, utilities, repairs and maintenance, advertising costs and credits, rent, insurance,   d  epreciation, leasehold amortization and costs for outside provided services.    The   majority of the   increase in operating, general and administrative expenses was   driven by increased sales. 

The Company may not be able to recover rising expenses through increased prices charged to its customers.    The majority of our associates   were   paid hourly   rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws  .     T  he Company increased the base hourly rate for associates to $9 per hour, as of August 2, 2015  ,   in order to attract and retain talented associates with a goal of delivering best-in-class customer service.  The Company has decided not   to   increa  se prices to offset this hourly wage rate increase.  

Employee-related costs such as wages, employer paid taxes, health care benefits and retirement plans, comprise   approximately 60% of   the total  Operating, general   and administrative expenses.   As   a percent of sales, direct store labor   in  creased 0.  2  % in the   third   quarter and   year-to-date     2016   compared to the same periods in 201  5  .  The increase   in   base hourly rate for   associat  es to   $9 per hour   and related wage compression had   an estimated cost of   $  1.1   million in the   third   quarter of 2016     and $  6.6   million year-to-date  .    I  ncreases in   e  mployee related expenses were offset by savings realized from a store labor efficiency project.   

The Company s self-insured health care benefit expenses increased $  540,000   or   9.3  % in the   third   quarter and $  869  ,000 or   4.9  % in the   first thirty-nine weeks   of 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015. The year-to-date variance   i  s mainly attributed to an increase in   group health   costs.  The Company remains concerned about the impact that The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will have on its future operating expenses.    Based on the ACA definition of full time employment  ,    t  here   is   approximately an 18% increase in full time employees  ,   which is currently estimated to   cost     the Company   $1.0 million   annually  . 

D  epreciation and amortization expense was $  19.2   million, or   2.6  % of net sales for the   third   quarter of 201  6  , compared to $  17.3   million, or   2.4  % of net sales for the   third   quarter of 201  5  .    D  epreciation and amort  i  zation expense   was $  56.2   million, or   2.5  % of net sales for the first   thirty-nine weeks   of 201  6  , compared to $  52.1   million or   2.4  % of net sales for the first   thirty-nine weeks   of 201  5  .  The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was the result   of additional capital expenditures as the Company implements its capital expansion program.  See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section   for further information regarding the Company s capital expansion progra  m.

Employee-related e  x  penses increased $3.6 million during the quarter   due to the   ten   former Food Lion, LLC and   five former   Mars Super Market stores   during   the third quarter of 2016  .  In addition, the year-to-date increase in e  mployee-  related expenses   was   primarily   related to   increases in the basic hourly rate   and     increases in sales volume.      Hourly employees, particularly part  -  time employees, are required to work increased hours when there is growth in sales volume.    Increases in employee-related expenses were offset by savings realized from a   store labor efficiency project.   

Depr  e  ciation and amortization increased   in both periods   presented   as a result of the Company s     store capital expenditure   program   and technology   investments.  

General liability insurance expense   in  creased   during the quarter   due to   the development of a few claims  .    

Store advertising expense   in  creased   $1.0 million   during   the   quarter     due to   the   ten     former   Food Lion, LLC and   five former   Mars Super Market   stores   during   the third quarter of 2016  .        The   additional   increase can   b  e attributed to new projects completed in   2016  .    

Acquisition  -  related e  x  penses, excluding the expenses me  n  tioned above, primarily consis  ted of store operating expenses  ,    travel expenses and contracted   labor for   store   resets  .    

Investment Income     The Company s investment portfolio consists   of marketable securities, which currently includes municipal bonds and equity securities, as well as the Company s SERP investment, which is comprised of mutual funds that are maintained within the Company s non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan and the non-qualified pharmacist deferred compensation plan.  The Company classifies all of its municipal bonds and equity securities as available-for-sale  .       The SERP investments are classified as trading   securities  .

The increase in the effective income tax rate   wa  s due to an increase in the state tax expense.  Historically, the effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate, primarily due to the effect of state taxes, net of permanent differences  .

The increase was p  rimarily   attributed   to the Company   purchasing   seven   properties in 2016  .       In a  ddition  ,     the Company invested $47.  5   million   towards the purchase   of five former   Mars Super Ma  r  ket   stores   and   ten former F  ood Lion, LLC   stores   in the third quarter   of 2016  .    As a percentage of sales, capital expenditures   including the acquisitions   were   6.5  % and   3.0  % in the first   thirty-nine weeks   of 201  6   and 201  5  , respectively.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND   QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market risk   is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and a decline in the stock market.  The Company does not enter into derivatives, foreign exchange transactions or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  . 

The   Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and market pricing impacting   its   investment portfolio.  Its current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting of municipal bonds, U.S. money market securities, and high-grade corporate securities, directly or through managed funds.  Its cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in North America.  Its marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and market pricing risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase or if market pricing decreases.  If market interest rates were to increase and market pricing were to decrease immediately and uniformly by 10% from   levels at September 24, 2016, the Company   estimates that the fair value of its investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount and therefore it would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market conditions on   the Company s   investments  . 

In the third quarter of 2016, t  he Company   entered into an unsecured   Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association   that bears interest at a rate based on the   one month   LIBOR  .  See Note (7) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information  .    As a result of this borrowing activity, the Company i  s expos  ed to fluctuations   in interest rates  .      The   Credit Agreement  , along with cash flow from operations, are used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations.      The nature and amount of the Company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors.      The definitive extent of the Company s interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements, but the Company does not believe such risk is material.    Based on the $40.1 million principal outstanding under   the Company s   Revolving Credit Facility as of September 24, 2016, each hundred basis point in the   one   month LIBOR would result in a change in interest expense by $400,000 annually.  

There have been no material changes to   the Company s   market risk exposure since December 26, 2015. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, together with the Company s Disclosure Committee, evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the fiscal quarter ended   September    2  4  , 2016.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports was accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

In connection with the evaluation described above, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended   September    2  4  , 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting  .
