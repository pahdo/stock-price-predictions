FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
forward-looking statements regarding the Company within the meaning of Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve many risks and uncertainties.
Reference is made in particular to the description of our plans and objectives for future operations, assumptions underlying such
plans and objectives, and other forward-looking statements included in this report. All statements other than statements of historical
fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. Such statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking
terminology such as  may,   will,   should,   would,   could,   confident, 
 forecast,   hope,   likely,   plan,   possible,   potential, 
 predict,   project,   expect,   believe,   estimate,   anticipate, 
 intend,   continue,   future,   ongoing,  or similar terms, variations of such
terms or the negative of such terms. Such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a
number of factors and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements. Such statements address future events and conditions concerning, among others, capital expenditures, earnings, litigation,
regulatory matters, liquidity and capital resources, and accounting matters. Actual results in each case could differ materially
from those anticipated in such statements by reason of factors such as future economic conditions, changes in consumer demand,
legislative, regulatory and competitive developments in markets in which we operate, results of litigation, and other circumstances
affecting anticipated revenues and costs, and the risk factors set forth under  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed on March 30, 2016. 

YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON
THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  

The forward-looking statements made in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise, after the date on which
the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this report and the documents that
we reference in this report, including documents referenced by incorporation, completely and with the understanding that our actual
future results may be materially different from what we expect or hope. 

Explanatory Note  

As used in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q,  we,   us,   our,   ABHD  and the  Company  refer to Abtech Holdings,
Inc. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The December 31, 2015 consolidated
balance sheet included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was derived from audited financial statements but does not include
all disclosures required by GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have
been included. Operating results for the nine-month and three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015.

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION  

Abtech Holdings, Inc. ( ABHD 
or the  Company ) (formerly Laural Resources, Inc.), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February
13, 2007, with authorized capital stock of 300,000,000 shares at $0.001 par value. In 2015, the number of authorized shares of
capital stock was increased to 800,000,000. ABHD is the parent holding company. 

AbTech Industries, Inc. ( AbTech ),
a Delaware corporation with an authorized capital of 15,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value common stock and 5,000,000 shares of
$0.01 par value preferred stock, was acquired by ABHD in a reverse acquisition transaction on February 10, 2011. AbTech is a majority-owned
subsidiary of ABHD and the operating company. 

AbTech is an environmental technologies firm that provides innovative
solutions to address issues of water pollution. AbTech has developed and patented the Smart Sponge    polymer technology.
This technology s oil absorbing capabilities make it highly effective as a filtration media to remove hydrocarbons and other
pollutants from flowing or pooled water. AbTech has also licensed or developed other products that reduce bacteria, remove heavy
metals or reduce the volume of polluted water through evaporation. AbTech sells products and systems for the treatment of stormwater,
industrial process water and produced water in oil and gas extraction operations. AbTech is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona
and has a manufacturing facility located in Phoenix, Arizona. 

In 2012, the Company formed a subsidiary,
AEWS Engineering, LLC ( AEWS ), an independent civil and environmental engineering firm, established to provide engineering
and technology innovation to the water infrastructure sector. AEWS was initially owned 80% by the Company and 20% by a former executive
officer of AEWS. In May 2015, AEWS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company upon the relinquishment of the 20% interest
previously held by the former executive officer. Accordingly, the operations of AEWS for the periods reflected in these condensed
consolidated financial statements are allocated 100% to the Company. AEWS has an office located in Raleigh, North Carolina. The
operations of AEWS, focused on pursuing new business development activities, were transferred to AbTech in 2015 and as of September
30, 2016, AEWS was dormant. 

In 2013, the Company formed a wholly-owned
subsidiary in the United Kingdom, AbTech Industries (UK) Limited ( AbTech UK ). The Company intended to use this subsidiary
to conduct operations in the UK but never initiated operations. AbTech UK was dissolved on September 13, 2016. 

AbTech s wholly-owned subsidiary,
Environmental Security Corporation ( ESC ), was formed in 2003 to develop a sensor array technology designed to detect
impurities in water flows. ESC owns a U.S. patent on this technology and has acquired rights to another monitoring technology,
but otherwise had no operations during 2016 or 2015. 

The Company operates in one business segment
which is the filtration and treatment of polluted water. 

NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation  
   The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ABHD, AbTech, AEWS and ESC. Intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated. The shares of AbTech preferred stock that have not converted to shares of ABHD common stock
represent the non-controlling interest shown on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements
as of September 30, 2016, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited and, in the opinion
of the Company s management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such condensed consolidated financial
statements. Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. 

Use of Estimates    The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Revenue Recognition    The
Company recognizes revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met: 

Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement 
  The Company documents all terms of an arrangement in a quote signed or confirmed by the customer prior to recognizing revenue. 

Delivery Has Occurred or Services Have
Been Performed    The Company performs all services or delivers all products prior to recognizing revenue. Services are
considered to be performed when the services are complete. 

The Fee for the Arrangement is Fixed
or Determinable    Prior to recognizing revenue, a customer s fee is either fixed or determinable under the terms
of the quote or accepted customer purchase order. 

Collectability Is Reasonably Assured 
  Collectability is assessed on a customer by customer basis based on criteria outlined by management. 

In 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized
revenue from the sale of its Smart Sponge    and Smart Sponge Plus products, including Ultra-Urban   
Filters, Line Skimmers, Passive Skimmers and Smart Paks   . The Smart Paks are usually sold as a component of an engineered
system such as an end-of-pipe vault or other larger multi-product treatment train. The Company provides engineering design or other
services on some engineered solutions. Revenues from such services are recognized at the time they are rendered. 

The Company recognizes shipping and handling
fees as revenue and the related expenses as a component of cost of sales. All internal handling charges are charged to selling,
general and administrative expenses. 

The payment terms for sales made to customers
vary based on the credit worthiness of the particular customer and the size of the order. Some orders require prepayment of up
to 50% at the time the order is received, while others require payment in full before shipping or require payment within 30 days
of the date of shipment. Customers do not have a right of return for products purchased from the Company. The Company may, on occasion,
allow a return under appropriate conditions to promote good business practices; however, such returns have historically been and
are expected to continue to be minimal. Regardless of when payment is received from the customer, revenues are recognized in accordance
with the criteria for revenue recognition described above. 

Net Loss
Per Share     Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to controlling interests by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company has other potentially dilutive
securities outstanding that are not shown in a diluted net loss per share calculation because their effect in both 2016 and 2015
would be antidilutive. The following chart lists the securities as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 that were not included in the
computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been antidilutive: 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ,  which provides guidance for revenue recognition.
The guidance outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers
and supersedes the most current revenue recognition guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the
effective date of the new revenue recognition standard for public entities until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company is currently evaluating ASU No. 2014-09 and its potential impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12,
  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide
That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.   ASU No. 2014-12 provides explicit guidance
on whether to treat a performance target that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition that
affects vesting, or as a non-vesting condition that affects the grant-date fair value of an award. The update requires that compensation
costs are recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent
the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance
target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation
cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. This update is now effective. The Company
currently has no stock compensation awards outstanding that are affected by this guidance and, accordingly, this updated standard
had no effect on the Company s current consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about
an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ,  which provides guidance about management s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning for the annual period ending December 31, 2016 and interim
periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating ASU No. 2014-15 and its potential impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statement footnote disclosures. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-3,   Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , 
which provides that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Previously, the Company has recognized such debt
issuance costs as separate assets under the caption  deferred charges.  The Company has now adopted this new standard.
However, its adoption had no impact on the consolidated balance sheets dated September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 as all deferred
charges had been fully amortized as of December 31, 2015. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,   which requires entities to measure most inventory
 at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary
course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The standard takes effect for
public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new
guidance should be applied prospectively, and earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting
period. The Company is currently evaluating the new standard and does not expect that it will have a material effect on the Company s
measurement of inventory. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,   which requires that entities
classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This update is effective
for public entities for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those annual periods. The Company expects that this update will have no effect on the Company s current presentation of deferred
tax assets and liabilities because such assets and liabilities have been reduced to zero by the deferred tax valuation allowance. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-01,   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities,   which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial
instruments and affects all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. The update takes effect for public
entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is
currently evaluating the new standard and its potential impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which, among other provisions, requires lessees to recognize lease assets and
lease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. Under this new provision, a lessee should
recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years for public entities. The Company expects
that these amendments will significantly affect the manner in which operating leases are currently presented in its financial statements
and is currently evaluating the new standard and the scope of its impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, 
 which involves simplification of several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income
tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
For public entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company
is currently evaluating the new standard and its potential impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, 
 which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses
and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For public
companies that are Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) filers, the standard will take effect for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the new standard
which will apply to the estimation of credit losses on the Company s trade receivables but is not expected to have a material
effect on the Company s measurement of such credit losses. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   which
addresses how eight specific cash flow issues should be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments
in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments are to be applied using a retrospective transition method.
The Company is currently evaluating the new standard and its potential impact on the Company s presentation of the relevant
cash flow items in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

NOTE 3   INVENTORIES  

The Company uses a perpetual inventory system and periodic physical
test counts to determine inventory amounts at interim balance sheet dates. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market,
with cost computed on an average cost method which approximates the first-in, first-out basis. Inventory consisted of the following: 

NOTE 4   GOING CONCERN  

These unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company
as a going concern. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and
expenses, which raises doubts about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going
concern, the Company will need to generate additional revenue and obtain additional capital to fund its operating losses and service
its debt, including accounts payable, of which a substantial portion is presently past due. Management of the Company has developed
a strategy, which it believes will accomplish this objective through revenue growth and additional funding, which will enable the
Company to operate for the coming year.  If the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and
raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company may be unable to repay or otherwise settle the liabilities and debt
outstanding as of September 30, 2016, and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations
if no other means of financing operations are available.   As a result, the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm has included an emphasis-of-matter paragraph regarding the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern in their opinion attached to the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of these uncertainties.  

NOTE 5   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Accounts Payable, Related Party  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,  Accounts payable   related party  represents advertising fees
due to a non-profit organization of which the president of the Company is a director, and nominal amounts due to officers of the
Company for travel expenses. 

Accrued Expenses    At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued expenses included $204,125 and $134,125, respectively, for fees due to directors of the
Company for their services as directors. 

Stock Options    The Company
granted 1,525,000 stock options to directors and officers of the Company in February 2015 (see NOTE 8   STOCKHOLDERS 
DEFICIENCY). 

Private Placements    From
March through September 2016, an investor that is considered to be a related party because it has a beneficial ownership interest
in the Company of greater than 5% made several cash advances to the Company totaling $1,925,000, as a short-term loan. The specific
terms of these loans have not yet been determined. This same related party investor purchased from the Company a $950,000 secured
promissory note in March 2015, a $250,000 secured promissory note in April 2015 and a $650,000 secured promissory note in May 2015,
which were converted to common stock later in 2015. 

In May 2015, an individual who is an affiliate
of a greater than 5% shareholder advanced $300,000 to the Company as a short-term loan and in June 2016 this entity advanced $200,000
to the Company as a short-term loan. The specific terms of this $200,000 loan have not yet been determined. 

NOTE 6   PROMISSORY NOTES AND
OTHER DEBT  

Information regarding the various promissory
notes that were outstanding as of September 30, 2016 is set forth in the table below: 

(1)     The first and second extension options for this note were exercised by the Company extending
its original maturity date to April 12, 2016. As a result of the exercise of the first and second extension options on this note,
the number of warrant shares issued with the note was increased by 10,000 shares. On October 21, 2016, the Company and the note
holder mutually agreed to amend the note by: (i) extending the maturity date to October 31, 2017; (ii) continuing the interest
rate at 11.5% per annum through the new maturity date; (iii) obligating the Company to make monthly payments on the note of $10,000
per month beginning in November 2016; and (iv) adding a conversion feature to the note that will allow the note holder to convert
the unpaid balance due under the note into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion rate of $0.032 per share.    

(2)     The first and second extension options for this note were exercised by the Company extending
its original maturity date to May 11, 2016. As a result of the exercise of the first and second extension options on this note,
the number of warrant shares issued with the note was increased by 25,000 shares.     

(3)     In March 2016, the Company and the holder of these notes mutually agreed to: (i) allow these
notes to convert to common stock of the Company at the conversion price of $0.03 per share, provided that such conversion take
place prior to April 15, 2016; and (ii) extend the maturity dates for the unsecured notes to April 15, 2016. The special conversion
feature for these notes expired on April 15, 2016 without the notes having been converted. As of September 30, 2016, these notes
were in technical default due to the fact that they were not repaid prior to their extended maturity date. However, the note holder
had not declared an event of default. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company was in discussions with the holder of these
notes to further extend the maturity dates. The Company can provide no assurance that such discussions will result in the extension
of the maturity dates of the notes.                                                     

(4)     As of September 30, 2016, this note was in technical default
                              due to the fact that it was not repaid prior to its maturity date. However, the note holder did
                              not declare an event of default and with the extension of the maturity date described above, the
                              note is no longer in technical default.   

The note discounts resulting from warrants
issued with the notes and any beneficial conversion features inherent in the convertible notes, were amortized under the effective
interest method over the original term of the promissory notes. As of December 31, 2015, the note discounts were fully amortized
and there was no interest expense related to the amortization of these discounts for the three or nine months ended September 30,
2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the interest expense related to the amortization of these discounts
was $135,571 and $425,811, respectively. 

The secured notes have a security interest
in all of the personal property and other assets of the Company. 

Bank Line of Credit  

The Company has a bank line of credit with
a credit limit of $100,000. This line of credit has an annual interest rate of prime plus 6.75% (10.25% as of September 30, 2016)
and requires monthly payment of any interest due plus approximately 1% of the outstanding balance. At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the outstanding balance due on the bank line of credit was $85,438 and $0, respectively. 

Due to Investors  

The amount shown in the condensed consolidated
balance sheets as due to investors represents short-term loans made to the Company by related party investors (see NOTE 5  
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    Private Placements ). The terms of these loans have not yet been determined. However,
the Company is accruing interest on the outstanding balance of the loans at the rate of 10% per annum as this represents the current
estimate of the interest rate to be charged when terms of the loan are finalized. 

NOTE 7   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS  

The Company s financial instruments
consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable and convertible notes
payable. It is management s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising
from these financial instruments. The fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying values, using level
3 inputs, based on their short maturities, or for long-term debt, based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for
loans with similar terms and maturities. Gains and losses recognized on changes in fair value of financial instruments, if any,
are reported in other income (expense) as gain (loss) on change in fair value. At September 30, 2016, the Company had no financial
instruments outstanding that were estimated using level 1, level 2 or level 3 inputs, other than discussed above. 

NOTE 8   STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIENCY  

The $18,204 increase in additional paid-in
capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is attributable to stock based compensation for stock options vesting during
the period. 

There were no stock options granted during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The 1,525,000 stock options granted to officers and directors of the Company in February
2015 all expired during 2015 without being exercised. 

NOTE 9   
LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES   

On May 28, 2015, the Company received a
subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) that stated that the staff of the SEC is conducting
an investigation   In the Matter of Abtech Holdings, Inc. (NY-9262)  .  Generally, the SEC s subpoena asked
for all documents, agreements, and communications concerning (i) the Company s Contract for Services with Nassau County,
New York, dated October 8, 2013; (ii) Adam Skelos, Dean Skelos, and their related entities; (iii) SLC Clean Water, LLC, Axiom,
Glenwood Management, and a number of other listed individuals and entities; (iv) certain Board and Board committee minutes and
related materials; (v) certain policies, procedures, and internal controls in effect at the Company; (vi) certain communications
with the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, transfer agent, potential and current investors, broker-dealers,
investment advisors, and finders; and (vii) certain other organizational and financial account information of the Company. 
The Company is cooperating with the SEC and has provided a substantial number of documents in response to the subpoena.  The
Company believes the SEC s subpoena is a result of the complaint announced on May 4, 2015 that was filed by federal authorities
against Dean and Adam Skelos. That trial came to an end in December 2015 when both men were convicted of eight counts each, including
fraud, bribery and extortion of three separate companies   one of which was the Company. The Company cooperated fully with
the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York throughout the Skelos investigation and trial,
by providing documents and other evidence and having the Company s president and CEO testify on behalf of the government
at the trial. With the trial now concluded, the Company s involvement in this matter has ended and the Department of Justice
has confirmed to the Company that the Company and its subsidiaries are not the subject or target of any ongoing public corruption
investigation. The Company continues to cooperate with the SEC in responding to the subpoena issued on May 28, 2015. 

In May 2016, the Company and its subsidiary,
AEWS, received letters from the New York State Joint Commission on Public Ethics ( JCOPE ) asking for a written response
to allegations constituting potential violations of lobbying laws in the state of New York. The Company s legal counsel provided
a written response to JCOPE on May 31, 2016, wherein they presented the Company s position that it has consistently complied
with all applicable lobbying laws. On August 15, 2016, JCOPE issued a notice to the Company that JCOPE had decided to commence
an investigation to determine whether a substantial basis exists to conclude that the Company knowingly and willfully violated
lobbying laws in the state of New York. The Company intends to defend its position that it has consistently complied with all applicable
lobbying laws and is working with JCOPE to resolve this matter. However, it is not clear at this time how the matter will ultimately
be resolved. 

In accordance with the stockholder proposal
approved by the Company s stockholders at the May 13, 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company has engaged legal
counsel to assess whether the Company should pursue legal action to recover financial losses and damages pertaining to the United
States vs. Dean Skelos and Adam Skelos case (the  Stockholder Proposal ). The Company is currently considering the
recommendation of legal counsel as it pertains to this Stockholder Proposal. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
incurred approximately $1,900,000 in legal fees and other costs related to the matters described above, including approximately
$511,000 incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company cannot estimate at this time the cost of additional
legal representation in resolving the SEC investigation, or pursuing legal action pursuant to the Stockholder Proposal. 

The Company has filed a claim for coverage
for some of these legal fees under a liability insurance policy. The insurer has denied the claim and the Company has engaged legal
counsel to dispute the insurer s denial of the claim. In an attempt to reach a settlement with the insurer regarding this
claim, a mediation hearing was held in April 2016. This mediation concluded with no resolution of the matter and, therefore, on
July 11, 2016, the Company filed a formal complaint against the insurer in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York. The Company is currently in discussions with the insurer in an attempt to settle the claim. However, the ultimate
outcome of this claim cannot be determined at this time. 

NOTE 10   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

Subsequent to
September 30, 2016, the Company received additional short-term funding of $661,000 from an investor considered to be a related
party because it has a beneficial ownership interest in the Company of greater than 5%, bringing the total due to investors for
these short-term loans in 2016 to $3,086,000. The Company and the related party investors are currently working out the terms for
these funded amounts (see  NOTE 6   PROMISSORY NOTES AND OTHER DEBT   Due to Investors). 

In October 2017, the Company amended a
promissory note that was outstanding and in technical default as of September 30, 2016, by extending its maturity date and modifying
other terms of the note as described in NOTE 6   PROMISSORY NOTES AND OTHER DEBT. Accordingly, this note was not in technical
default as of the filing date. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.  

The following discussion and analysis should
be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 1 in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result
of a variety of business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many
of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. Please refer to page 2 of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for additional information regarding forward-looking statements. 

Overview  

Management is
focused on establishing the Company as a reliable provider of water treatment solutions in the emerging markets for the treatment
of stormwater, produced water and other industrial water applications.  Abtech Holdings, Inc. (the  Company 
or  ABHD ) is the parent holding company. Its subsidiary, AbTech Industries, Inc. ( AbTech ), is the operating
company that manufactures and sells water treatment products, many of which incorporate its patented Smart Sponge technology. Another
subsidiary, AEWS Engineering, LLC ( AEWS ), has provided engineering services to assist government and industry in
developing effective solutions to their specific water treatment needs. The operations of AEWS were transferred to AbTech in 2015
and AEWS is currently dormant. ESC is also a dormant subsidiary that holds a patent regarding a sensor array technology designed
to detect impurities in water flows. AbTech Industries (UK) Limited ( AbTech UK ) is a subsidiary established to develop
business in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. AbTech UK was dissolved on September 13, 2016 and had no operations in
the periods covered by this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, 
which is based on the consolidated operations of ABHD and its subsidiaries. 

The Company is incurring significant costs
as it seeks to gain traction in its targeted water treatment markets and position itself with validated treatment solutions that,
if accepted and adopted by the market, can generate significant revenues in the future. The Company s operations reflect
limited historical sales revenue as the Company attempts to engage in those business development activities that management believes
have the greatest opportunity to generate future revenues. Key factors affecting the Company s results of operations during
the periods covered in this section include revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and interest expense. 

Results of Operations  

We generate revenues by selling products
and services related to the treatment of contaminated water so that such water can either be discharged or reused. All of our products
sold in 2016 and 2015 include some form of Smart Sponge filtration media, which we manufacture, or are accessories used for the
deployment of Smart Sponge products, such as diversion collars, vessels and containment cages. Our products include a variety of
designs and sizes to effectively address many applications where water treatment is needed. Our revenue for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2016 was comprised of the following: 

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015   

Revenues  

Revenues for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by approximately $212,000 (57%) compared to revenues in the same period of the prior year which included approximately
$107,000 from the sale of products to Naylor Industries, the Company s distributor in the United Kingdom and approximately
$22,000 of revenue on the stormwater contract with Nassau County (the  Contract ). There were no similar revenues recognized
in the first nine months of 2016. The Contract with Nassau County was suspended in May 2015 following the announcement of the federal
investigation of New York State Senator Dean Skelos, and his son Adam Skelos, who had acted as a consultant to the Company. As
a consequence of the negative publicity for the Company surrounding these events and the difficulty encountered in moving other
municipal stormwater projects forward in the face of continued funding constraints for new municipal and federal facility stormwater
projects, the Company began to direct a greater portion of its sales efforts towards non-stormwater applications of its products
in commercial and industrial markets, while continuing to support stormwater product sales through direct sales staff and through
distributors in international markets. The Company s redirected sales efforts did not have a significant impact on revenue
in the first nine months of 2016 as most of the new opportunities being pursued have long lead times and require additional product
development and testing. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, our largest customer was a construction company accounting for 12% of revenues. There were no other single customers accounting
for more than 10% of revenues in this period. 

Gross Margin  

The Company s gross margin on sales
was negative (59%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a positive gross margin on sales of 8% for the same
period of 2015. The negative gross margin in 2016 is the direct result of the low level of production that was needed to support
sales in the first nine months of 2016. With this low level of production, the fixed costs of excess capacity exceeded the standard
margins earned on product sales resulting in the negative gross margin. The Company s manufacturing facility operated at
less than 1% of operating capacity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and at approximately 2% of capacity for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The significant gross margin difference between the two periods illustrates the significant favorable
impact increased production levels can have on gross margins. Going forward, the Company expects that gross margin percentages,
quarter by quarter, could vary widely depending on the volume of product sales and the corresponding volume of product manufacturing. 

Selling, general and administrative
expenses  

Selling, general
and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $684,000 or 19% in the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same
period in 2015. This decrease was due primarily to an approximate: (i) $189,000 reduction in consulting fees, including fees paid
for public relations and investor relations; (ii) $222,000 reduction in stock based compensation related to the vesting of stock
options granted to officers, directors and advisory board members  of the Company, with such expense reduction reflecting
the expiration or prior full vesting of most outstanding options and no new stock options being granted during the first nine months
of 2016 ;  (iii) $87,000 reduction in recruiting fees; (iv) $75,000 reduction in general legal
fees; and  (v) $597,000 reduction in legal fees incurred by the Company in responding to the federal
investigation regarding the complaint filed against New York State Senator Dean Skelos and his son, Adam Skelos, and the subpoena
received by the Company from the SEC regarding its investigation  In the Matter of Abtech Holdings, Inc. (NY-9262)   (for
further information regarding these matters, see PART II, Item 1.  Legal Proceedings ). Legal fees for these matters
totaled approximately $447,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $1,044,000 in the same period of 2015. These and other
expense category reductions in the first half of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015, were partially offset by increases
in other expense categories in 2016 including increases of approximately: (a) $266,000 for payroll and benefit costs related to
the Company s redirected sales effort including the addition of a team of seasoned sales professionals with extensive experience
in industrial markets; (b) $64,000 for travel related costs; (c) $148,000 for legal fees related to the Company s dispute
with an insurer regarding claims for coverage of legal fees under a liability insurance policy; (d) $63,000 in legal fees related
to a review conducted by legal counsel pursuant to a stockholder proposal approved by the Company s stockholders at the May
13, 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (see PART II, Item 1.  Legal Proceedings ); and (e) a $65,000 increase in audit
costs primarily related to the Company s independent registered public accountants responding to SEC subpoenas regarding
the SEC investigation mentioned above. 

Research and development expenses  

Research and development ( R D )
expenses increased by approximately $115,000 (14%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period
of the prior year. The higher R D expenses in 2016 were primarily attributable to work conducted to develop and test the Company s
evaporator technology, intended for use in the treatment of produced water at oil and gas drilling sites, and the development of
the manufacturing processes to produce the Company s licensed heavy metals filtration media. These costs totaled approximately
$249,000 during the first nine months of 2016. Field testing costs incurred in the first nine months of 2015 were only $15,000.
These increased R D expenses in 2016 were partially offset by expense reductions of approximately $120,000 for consultants,
$28,000 for university co-op R D projects and $55,000 for payroll and benefits in the first nine months of 2016 as compared
to the same period of 2015. 

Other income (expense)  

Interest expense decreased substantially for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015, due to the significant debt conversions that
took place in the fourth quarter of 2015, which reduced the amount of outstanding debt by approximately $9.9 million. The various
components of interest expense that accounted for the decrease are summarized in the table below: 

Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015   

Revenues  

Revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by approximately $47,000 (47%) compared to revenues in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in revenue
is primarily the consequence of the negative publicity for the Company following the federal investigation of New York State Senator
Dean Skelos and his son Adam Skelos, who had acted as a consultant to the Company. The Company has also encountered continued difficulty
in moving municipal stormwater projects forward in the face of continued funding constraints for new municipal and federal facility
stormwater projects, although it continues to pursue several potential projects where its technologies are well suited to solving
the stormwater problems facing municipalities. With the slowdown in municipal stormwater sales, the Company has directed a greater
portion of its sales efforts towards non-stormwater applications of its products in commercial and industrial markets, while continuing
to support stormwater product sales through direct sales staff and through distributors in international markets. The Company s
redirected sales efforts did not have a significant impact on revenue in the third quarter of 2016 as most of the new opportunities
being pursued have long lead times and require additional product development and testing. 

Revenues in the third quarter of 2016 included
approximately $6,000 in fees for the treatment of produced water at a well site where the Company is piloting its new evaporator
technology, accounting for approximately 11% of third quarter revenue. Two other customers accounted for 18% and 12% of revenue,
respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Gross Margin  

The Company s gross margin on sales was
negative (65%) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a positive gross margin on sales of 7% for the same period
of 2015. The negative gross margin in 2016 is the direct result of the low level of production that was needed to support sales
during the quarter. With this low level of production, the fixed costs of excess capacity exceeded the standard margins earned
on product sales resulting in the negative gross margins. The Company s manufacturing facility operated at less than 1% of
operating capacity for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 1.4% of operating capacity for the same period of the prior
year. Going forward, the Company expects that gross margin percentages, quarter by quarter, could vary widely depending on the
volume of product sales and the corresponding volume of product manufacturing. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses  

Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased by approximately $511,000 or 36% in the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease
was due primarily to the legal fees incurred by the Company in responding to the federal investigation regarding the complaint
filed against New York State Senator Dean Skelos and his son, Adam Skelos, and the subpoena received by the Company from the SEC
regarding its investigation  In the Matter of Abtech Holdings, Inc. (NY-9262)  (for further information regarding these matters,
see PART II, Item 1.  Legal Proceedings ). Legal fees for these matters totaled approximately $50,000 in the third
quarter of 2016 compared to $578,000 in the third quarter of 2015. Other expense reductions in the third quarter of 2016, as compared
to the same quarter of 2015, included an approximate: (i) $69,000 reduction in stock based compensation related to the vesting
of stock options granted to officers, directors and advisory board members of the Company, with such expense reduction reflecting
the expiration or prior full vesting of most outstanding options and no new stock options being granted during the third quarter
of 2016, and (ii) $55,000 reduction in recruiting fees. These expense reductions in the third quarter of 2016 were partially offset
by expense increases of approximately $67,000 for payroll and benefit costs and $18,000 for travel costs, all related to the Company s
redirected sales effort including the addition of a team of seasoned sales professionals with extensive experience in industrial
markets. In addition, in the third quarter of 2016, the Company incurred approximately $38,000 in legal fees related to its dispute
with an insurer regarding claims for coverage of legal fees under a liability insurance policy (see PART II, Item 1.  Legal
Proceedings ), and experienced a $30,000 increase in audit costs related to the Company s independent registered public
accountants responding to SEC subpoenas regarding the SEC investigation mentioned above. 

Research and development  

R D expenses decreased by approximately
$15,000 (6%) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of the prior year. The lower R D
expenses in 2016 were primarily attributable to expense reductions of approximately $34,000 for payroll and benefits, $10,000 for
consultants and $14,000 for university co-op R D projects in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015.
These and other R D category expense decreases in 2016 were partially offset by expenses for work conducted to develop and
test the Company s evaporator technology, intended for use in the treatment of produced water at oil and gas drilling sites.
These costs totaled approximately $58,000 during the third quarter of 2016. Field testing costs incurred in the third quarter of
2015 were only approximately $5,000. 

Other income (expense)  

Interest expense decreased substantially for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015, due to the significant debt conversions that
took place in the fourth quarter of 2015, which reduced the amount of outstanding debt by approximately $9.9 million. The various
components of interest expense that accounted for the decrease are summarized in the table below: 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a
working capital deficiency of approximately $5,722,000, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $1,713,000 at December
31, 2015. The increased working capital deficiency is primarily attributable to the use of cash for operations during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, short term borrowings of $2,425,000 made in the first nine months of 2016 and an increase in accounts
payable and other accrued liabilities of approximately $851,000 during the period. Current debt totaling $100,000 at December 31,
2015 was extended in 2016 resulting in this debt being classified as long-term debt as of September 30, 2016. The Company s
cash balance decreased from $682,860 at December 31, 2015, to $56,321 at September 30, 2016. This cash balance represents less
than one month of the Company s historical monthly cash used for operations and evidences the Company s need to raise
additional capital in the immediate short-term. In the month of October and November 2016, the Company received additional short-term
loans of $661,000 from a related party stockholder to fund operations. 

To date, the Company has not generated sufficient
revenue to cover its operating costs and expenses and continues to operate with negative cash flow. While we hope to achieve sales
growth sufficient to cover operating costs and expenses over the long-term, continued negative cash flow from operations is expected
in the short-term. The Company will require additional capital to maintain current operations until the Company achieves the sales
growth necessary to cover operating costs and expenses. The Company also has approximately $3,803,000 of short-term debt, including
accrued interest, which will need to be repaid, extended or refinanced by the Company. In addition, should the Company experience
rapid sales growth, it may decide to pursue other working capital financing arrangements. 

Operations in the first nine months of 2016
were funded with the cash on hand at the beginning of that period, $2,425,000 of cash advances provided by two related party stockholders,
and $90,000 in draws on the Company s bank line of credit. 

The Company s bank line of credit has
a credit limit of $100,000. The line of credit has an annual interest rate of prime plus 6.75% and requires monthly payment of
any interest due plus approximately 1% of the outstanding balance. At September 30, 2016 the outstanding balance due on the bank
line of credit was $85,438. 

In 2013, the Company entered into an agreement
(the  Equity Line of Credit ) with Dutchess Opportunity Fund, II, LP ( Dutchess ) whereby Dutchess committed
to purchase up to $2 million of ABHD common stock from the Company over the course of 36 months. This Equity Line of Credit expired
in June 2016 with the Company having made no draws on it. 

Comparison of cash flows for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015   

Operating Activities  

The Company had negative cash flows from operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately $3,129,000, compared to negative cash flows from operations of approximately
$3,154,000 for the same period of the prior year. While the net loss in the first nine months of 2016 was approximately $1,484,000
less than the net loss for the same period of 2015, the difference in net cash used for operations between the two periods was
only approximately $25,000 due to the fact that (i) the net loss for the first nine months of 2015 included non-cash expenses of
approximately $956,000 for stock issued for services, stock based compensation, note discount amortization and deferred charges
expensed as interest, whereas in the same period of 2016 there were only approximately $18,000 of such charges; and (ii) the combined
increase in payables and other accrued liabilities during the first nine months of 2015 was approximately $1,358,000, compared
to approximately $851,000 for the same period of 2016. In addition, during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, accounts receivable
decreased by approximately $89,000 and $61,000, respectively, further reducing the amount of cash used in operations during those
periods. 

Investing Activities  

The Company had $2,901 of capital expenditures
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $4,879 of capital expenditures for the same period of 2015. As of September 30,
2016, the Company had no commitments for any material future capital expenditures. 

Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to approximately $2,506,000, compared to cash provided by financing activities
of approximately $2,114,000 in the same period of 2015. The primary financing sources of cash in the first nine months of 2016
were cash advances totaling $2,425,000 from two related party stockholders and draws of $90,000 on the Company s bank line
of credit. 

Going Concern and Management s Plans  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As discussed in NOTE 4
to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we have not achieved a sufficient level of revenues to support
our business and have suffered substantial recurring losses from operations since our inception, resulting in a significant accumulated
deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue operations as a going concern. As
such, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm in their report dated March 30, 2016, included an emphasis-of-matter
paragraph with respect to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 concerning the Company s
assumption that we will continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of
liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management
believes that the Company s ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent on its ability to raise additional capital
and/or generate significant sales growth in the short term. The Company s ability to achieve these objectives cannot be determined
at this time. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in NOTE 4 to the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital and/or generate significant sales growth in the near
term there is a risk that the Company may be unable to repay or otherwise settle the liabilities or debt outstanding as of September
30, 2016, and could be required to significantly reduce the scope of or cease its operations if no other means of financing its
operations are available. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors. 

Contractual Obligations  

As a smaller reporting company, as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), we are not required to provide
the information required by this item pursuant to Item 303(d) of Regulation S-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

This Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments. Management bases the estimates on
historical experience and on various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment
to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. 

The going concern basis of presentation assumes
we will continue in operation throughout the next fiscal year and into the foreseeable future and will be able to realize our assets
and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As discussed above, certain conditions currently
exist which raise substantial doubt upon the validity of this assumption. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty. 

The methods, estimates, interpretations and
judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report
in our condensed consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be
those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity s financial condition and results of operations
and those that require the entity s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make
estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain when estimated. 

The following discussion provides supplemental
information regarding the significant estimates, judgments and assumptions made in implementing the Company s critical accounting
policies. 

Fair value of warrants and note discount  

The Company bifurcates the value of warrants
sold with promissory notes. This bifurcation results in the establishment of a note discount with a corresponding charge to equity
unless the terms of the warrant require it to be classified as a liability. The warrants and corresponding discounts are valued
using the Black-Scholes valuation model because there is no market price available for the warrants. This model uses estimates
of volatility, risk free interest rate and the expected term of the warrants, along with the current market price of the Company s
common stock, to estimate the value of the outstanding warrants. The assumptions for expected dividend yield, expected volatility
and expected term reflect management s judgment and include consideration of historical experience. Expected volatility is
based on historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the warrant. 

Inventory valuation  

The Company s inventory is stated at
the lesser of cost or market, with cost computed on an average cost method which approximates the first-in, first-out basis. Provision
is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate. This estimated valuation requires that management make
certain judgments about the likelihood that specific inventory items may have minimal or no realizable value in the future. These
judgments are based on the current quantity of the item on hand compared to historical sales volumes, potential alternative uses
of the products and the age of the inventory item. 

Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful
accounts  

There are four factors that the Company uses
to determine the appropriate timing of the recognition of revenue. Three of these factors (evidence of arrangement exists, delivery
occurs and fee is fixed or determinable) are generally factual considerations that are not subject to material estimates or assumptions.
With regard to projects where revenue is earned for a variety of tasks including design, installation and maintenance activities,
the Company accounts for the project using the percentage-of-completion method and makes estimates of the completion percentages
based on the cost actually incurred to complete each project task. The fourth factor involves judgment regarding the collectability
of the sales price. The Company only ships product when it has reasonable assurance that it will receive payment from the customer.
When such assurance is not available, the Company will require payment in advance. The assessment of a customer s credit-worthiness
is reliant on management s judgment regarding such factors as previous payment history, credit rating, credit references
and market reputation. If any sales are made that ultimately become uncollectible, the Company charges the uncollected amount against
a reserve for uncollectible accounts. This reserve is established and adjusted from time to time based on management s assessment
of each outstanding receivable and the likelihood of it being collected. 

Stock-based compensation  

The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to
estimate the value of options and warrants issued to employees and consultants as compensation for services rendered to the Company.
This model uses estimates of volatility, risk free interest rate and the expected term of the options or warrants, along with the
current market price of the underlying stock, to estimate the value of the options and warrants on the date of grant. In addition,
the calculation of compensation costs requires that the Company estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited during the
vesting period. The fair value of the stock-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the awards. For stock-based awards
that vest based on performance conditions, expense is recognized when it is probable that the conditions will be met. There were
no options granted by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Accounting for conversion options and imputed
interest  

The convertible promissory notes issued by
the Company provide the note holders an option to convert the notes into the Company s common stock at a set price. The value
of these options has not been bifurcated from the value of the related notes because management has determined that such bifurcation
is not required under GAAP due to the specific terms of the conversion option and management s estimate that the underlying
shares would not be readily convertible into cash. However, whenever such conversion options represent a right to convert at a
price that is less than the market price at the date of issuance, the Company imputes the value of such beneficial conversion feature
and charges it to interest expense over the term of the notes. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.  

As a smaller reporting company, as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this item pursuant to Item 305(e)
of Regulation S-K. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. We believe that a control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within any company have been detected. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings.  

On May 28, 2015, the Company received a subpoena
from the SEC that stated that the staff of the SEC is conducting an investigation   In the Matter of Abtech Holdings, Inc.
(NY-9262)  .  Generally, the SEC s subpoena asked for all documents, agreements, and communications concerning
(i) the Company s Contract for Services with Nassau County, New York, dated October 8, 2013; (ii) Adam Skelos, Dean Skelos,
and their related entities; (iii) SLC Clean Water, LLC, Axiom, Glenwood Management, and a number of other listed individuals and
entities; (iv) certain Board and Board committee minutes and related materials; (v) certain policies, procedures, and internal
controls in effect at the Company; (vi) certain communications with the Company s independent registered public accounting
firm, transfer agent, potential and current investors, broker-dealers, investment advisors, and finders; and (vii) certain other
organizational and financial account information of the Company.  The Company is cooperating with the SEC and has provided
a substantial number of documents in response to the subpoena.  The Company believes the SEC s subpoena is a result
of the complaint announced on May 4, 2015 that was filed by federal authorities against Dean and Adam Skelos. That trial came to
an end in December 2015 when both men were convicted of eight counts each, including fraud, bribery and extortion of three separate
companies   one of which was the Company. The Company cooperated fully with the United States Attorney s Office for
the Southern District of New York throughout the Skelos investigation and trial, by providing documents and other evidence and
having the Company s president and CEO testify on behalf of the government at the trial. With the trial now concluded, the
Company s involvement in this matter has ended and the Department of Justice has confirmed to the Company that the Company
and its subsidiaries are not the subject or target of any ongoing public corruption investigation. The Company continues to cooperate
with the SEC in responding to the subpoena issued on May 28, 2015. 

In May 2016, the Company and its subsidiary,
AEWS, received letters from the New York State Joint Commission on Public Ethics ( JCOPE ) asking for a written response
to allegations constituting potential violations of lobbying laws in the state of New York. The Company s legal counsel provided
a written response to JCOPE on May 31, 2016, wherein they presented the Company s position that it has consistently complied
with all applicable lobbying laws. On August 15, 2016, JCOPE issued a notice to the Company that JCOPE had determined to commence
an investigation to determine whether a substantial basis exists to conclude that the Company knowingly and willfully violated
lobbying laws in the state of New York. The Company intends to defend its position that it has consistently complied with all applicable
lobbying laws and is working with JCOPE to resolve this matter. However, it is not clear at this time how the matter will ultimately
be resolved. 

In accordance with the stockholder proposal
approved by the Company s stockholders at the May 13, 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company has engaged legal
counsel to assess whether the Company should pursue legal action to recover financial losses and damages pertaining to the United
States vs. Dean Skelos and Adam Skelos case (the  Stockholder Proposal ). The Company is currently considering the
recommendation of legal counsel as it pertains to this Stockholder Proposal. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had incurred
approximately $1,900,000 in legal fees and other costs related to the matters described above, including $511,000 incurred during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company cannot estimate at this time the cost of additional legal representation
in resolving the SEC investigation, or pursuing legal action pursuant to the Stockholder Proposal. 

The Company has filed a claim for coverage
for some of these legal fees under a liability insurance policy. The insurer has denied the claim and the Company has engaged legal
counsel to dispute the insurer s denial of the claim. In an attempt to reach a settlement with the insurer regarding this
claim, a mediation hearing was held in April 2016. This mediation concluded with no resolution of the matter and, therefore, on
July 11, 2016, the Company filed a formal complaint against the insurer in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York. The Company is currently in discussions with the insurer in an attempt to settle the claim. However, the ultimate
outcome of this claim cannot be determined at this time. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.  

As a smaller reporting company, as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this item pursuant to Item 503(e)
of Regulation S-K. 

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.  

None. 

Item 3.    Defaults Upon Senior Securities.  

As of September 30, 2016, there were three outstanding promissory
notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 that were in technical default due to the fact that they were not
repaid prior to their extended maturity dates. However, the note holder had not declared an event of default. Subsequent to September
30, 2016, the Company was in discussions with the holder of these notes to further extend the maturity dates although there can
be no assurance that such discussions will result in an extension of the maturity dates of the notes. 

Item 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures  

Not applicable. 

Item 5.    Other Information  

During 2016, two investors, considered to be
related parties because they have beneficial ownership interests in the Company of greater than 5%, have provided short-term funding
to the Company as follows:
