1.    OVERVIEW
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Overview;
Recent Reorganization  - Canterbury Park Holding Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated as a Minnesota corporation
in October 2015. The Company is a successor corporation to another corporation, also named Canterbury Park Holding Corporation,
that was incorporated in 1994 ( CPHC ). Effective as of the close of business on June 30, 2016 CPHC s business
and operations were reorganized into a holding company structure (the  Reorganization ) pursuant to an Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of March 1, 2016 that was approved by CPHC s shareholders on June 28, 2016. Pursuant to the Reorganization:  

The
                                         Company replaced CPHC as the public company owned by CPHC s shareholders, with
                                         each shareholder at June 30, 2016 owning the same number of shares and having the same
                                         percentage ownership in the Company (and, indirectly, in all property and other assets
                                         then owned by CPHC) immediately after the Reorganization as that shareholder had in CPHC
                                         immediately before the Reorganization.    

The
                                         Company became the holding company for and parent company of two subsidiaries, Canterbury
                                         Park Entertainment LLC ( EntertainmentCo ) and Canterbury Development LLC
                                         ( DevelopmentCo ).    

EntertainmentCo
                                         is the surviving business entity in a merger with CPHC pursuant to the Reorganization
                                         and it became the direct owner of all land, facilities, and substantially all other assets
                                         related to the CPHC s pari-mutuel wagering, Card Casino, concessions and other
                                         related businesses ( Racetrack Operations ), and EntertainmentCo continues
                                         to conduct these businesses consistent with CPHC s past practices and will continue
                                         to be subject to direct regulation by the Minnesota Racing Commission ( MRC ).    

DevelopmentCo
                                         will continue CPHC s efforts to commercially develop approximately 140 acres of
                                         land currently owned or controlled that is not needed for our Racetrack Operations. DevelopmentCo
                                         is not subject to direct regulation by the MRC.    

On
                                         July 1, 2016 the shares of the Company s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ
                                         Global Market under the symbol  CPHC.     

Further
information regarding the Reorganization is set forth in the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-210877)
filed with the SEC on April 22, 2016, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  

For
purposes of this Report on Form 10-Q, when the term  Company  is used with reference to information covering or related
to periods up to and including June 30, 2016, such term refers to the operations of CPHC prior to the Reorganization.  

Business
   The Company s Racetrack operations are conducted at facilities located in Shakopee, Minnesota, approximately
25 miles southwest of downtown Minneapolis. In May 1994, the Company commenced year-round horse racing simulcast operations and
hosted the first annual live race meet during the summer of 1995. The Company s live racing operations are a seasonal business
as it hosts live race meets each year from May until September. The Company earns additional pari-mutuel revenue by televising
its live racing to out-of-state racetracks around the country. Canterbury Park s Card Casino operates 24 hours a day, seven
days a week and is limited by Minnesota State law to conducting card play on a maximum of 80 tables. The Card Casino currently
offers a variety of poker and table games. The Company s three largest sources of revenues include: Card Casino operations,
pari-mutuel operations and food and beverage sales. The Company also derives revenues from related services and activities, such
as admissions, advertising signage, publication sales, and from other entertainment events and activities held at the Racetrack.  

Basis
of Presentation and Preparation    The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company (Canterbury Park Holding Corporation, Canterbury Park Entertainment, LLC, Canterbury Park Concession, Inc. and
Canterbury Development, LLC) Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP )
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  

7  

These
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, included in its Annual Report
on Form 10-K (the  2015 Form 10-K ).  

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies    A detailed description of our significant accounting policies can be found in our
most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. There were no material changes in significant
accounting policies during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

Due
to Minnesota Horsemen s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. ( MHBPA )    The Minnesota Pari-mutuel
Horse Racing Act specifies that the Company is required to segregate a portion of funds (recorded as purse expense in the statements
of operations), received from Card Casino operations and wagering on simulcast and live horse races, for future payment as purses
for live horse races or other uses of the horsepersons  associations. Pursuant to an agreement with the MHBPA, the Company
transferred into a trust account or paid directly to the MHBPA, $3,640,000 and $6,273,000 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $3,285,000 and $5,233,000 for the comparable periods in 2015 related to thoroughbred
races. Minnesota Statutes specify that amounts transferred into the trust account are the property of the trust and not of the
Company, and therefore are not recorded on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

Reclassifications
   Prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period
presentations. Insurance recovery proceeds received in the third quarter of 2015 have been reclassified on the  Consolidated
Statement of Operations  to  Gain on insurance recoveries  from  Other revenue  in the amount of approximately
$120,000.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncement   In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which simplifies
various aspects related to share-based payments. Previously, tax benefits in excess of compensation cost ( windfalls )
were recorded as an increase to shareholders  equity. Under the new ASU, windfalls are recorded as a component of income
tax expense. ASU 2016-09 also requires that tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments be reported as a part of
cash flows from operating activities. The Company believes the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements or diluted earnings per share.  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides a five-step analysis
of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue
in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revised guidance will become effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-
effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are assessing the impact of the new accounting guidance and currently cannot
estimate the financial statement impact of adoption.  

2.    STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION  

Stock-based
compensation is recorded at fair value as of the date of grant and included in the salaries and benefits expense line item on
the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and amounted to $64,000 for both years for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, stock-based compensation totaled $179,000 and $225,000,
respectively.  

Adoption
of Long Term Incentive Plan and Award of Deferred Stock   

Effective
March 30, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new plan for long-term incentive compensation of the Company s
named executive officers (NEOs) and other Senior Executives called the Canterbury Park Holding Corporation Long Term Incentive
Plan (the  LTI Plan ). The LTI Plan authorizes the grant of Long Term Incentive Awards that provide an opportunity
to NEOs and other Senior Executives to receive a payment in cash or shares of the Company s common stock to the extent of
achievement at the end of a period greater than one year (the  Performance Period ) as compared to Performance Goals
established at the beginning of the Performance Period. The LTI is a sub-plan of the Company s Stock Plan which authorizes
the grant of Deferred Stock awards that represent the right to receive Company common stock if conditions specified in the awards
are satisfied.  

8  

Effective
March 30, 2016, the Board approved granting opportunities to Company officers and key employees to earn long-term incentive compensation
under the LTI Plan. Each officer and key employee was granted an Incentive Award (that was also a Deferred Stock Award under the
Stock Plan) which provided an opportunity to receive a payout of shares of the Company s common stock to the extent of achievement
compared to Performance Goals at the end of the period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2018. Pursuant to these
awards the Company has reserved 24,000 shares that potentially may be issued under the Deferred Stock Awards. Further information
regarding the LTI Plan and the awards approved effective March 30, 2016 is presented under Item 5.02 in the Company s Report
on Form 8-K for March 30, 2016 (filed April 5, 2016), which information is incorporated herein by reference.  

Board
of Directors Stock Option and Restricted Stock Grants   

The
Company s Stock Plan authorizes annual grants of restricted stock or stock options, or both, to non-employee members of
the Board of Directors at the time of the Company s annual shareholders meeting as determined by the Board prior to each
such meeting. Options granted under the Plan generally expire 10 years after the grant date. Restricted stock grants generally
vest 100% one year after the date of the annual meeting in the prior year, are subject to restrictions on resale for an additional
year, and are subject to forfeiture if a board member terminates prior to the shares vesting. The following table presents a summary
of changes in Board of Directors  unvested restricted stock as of September 30, 2016:  

Employee
Stock Option Grants   

The
Company has granted incentive stock options to employees pursuant to the Company s Stock Plan with an exercise price equal
to the market price on the date of grant. The options vest over a 42-month period and expire in 10 years.  

9  

A
summary of stock option activity as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the nine months ended is presented below:  

Deferred
Stock Awards   

Prior
to January 1, 2016 the Company s Board awarded deferred compensation to executive officers and key employees that were not
performance-based in the form of Deferred Stock awards under the Company s Stock Plan. Such deferred stock awards are subject
to forfeiture if an employee terminates employment prior to the vesting. Generally, the awards vest ratably over a four-year period
and compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period. Compensation costs are recorded in  Salaries and benefits 
on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2016, 18,375 shares were not vested with a weighted
average fair value of $10.26 per share.  

3.    NET
INCOME PER SHARE COMPUTATIONS  

The
following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the earnings per common share computations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Options
to purchase 45,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $12.80 per share were outstanding but not included in the computation
of diluted net income per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 because the options were out of the money at September
30, 2016.  

10  

Options
to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $13.45 per share were outstanding but not included in the computation
of diluted net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 because the options were out of the money
at September 30, 2015.  

4.    PROMISSORY
NOTES RECEIVABLE  

During
May 2016, the Company sold approximately 24 acres of land adjacent to the Racetrack for a total consideration of approximately
$4.3 million. Promissory notes receivable consist of two promissory notes totaling $3,191,000 bearing interest at the mid-term
applicable federal rate, which equaled 1.43%. The payments totaling $1,094,000 are due annually and the notes mature May 2019.
The promissory notes are secured by the mortgage of approximately 24 acres and management believes no allowance for doubtful accounts
is necessary.  

5.    GENERAL
CREDIT AGREEMENT  

The
Company had a general credit and security agreement with Bremer Bank, which provided a revolving credit line of up to $3,000,000
and which expired on September 30, 2016. The line of credit was collateralized by all receivables, inventory, equipment, and general
intangibles of the Company. This agreement was replaced with a new agreement, See  Note 9. Subsequent Events . The Company
had no borrowings under the credit line during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015.  

6.    OPERATING
SEGMENTS  

The
Company has three reportable operating segments: horse racing, card casino, and food and beverage. The horse racing segment primarily
represents simulcast and live horse racing operations. The Card Casino segment represents operations of Canterbury Park s
Card Casino, and the food and beverage segment represents food and beverage operations provided during simulcast and live racing,
in the Card Casino, and during special and other catering and events operations. The Company s reportable operating segments
are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are managed separately because the segments differ
in the nature of the products and services provided as well as processes to produce those products and services. The Minnesota
Racing Commission regulates the horse racing and Card Casino segments.  

Depreciation,
interest and income taxes are allocated to the segments, but no allocation is made to food and beverage for shared facilities.
However, the food and beverage segment pays approximately 25% of gross revenues earned on live racing and special event days to
the horse racing segment for use of the facilities.  

The
following tables provide information about the Company s operating segments (in 000 s):  

11

  For September 30, 2016,  Segment (loss) income before income taxes  for Horse Racing includes the gain on sale of
land of approximately $3,990,000.  

The
following are reconciliations of reportable segment revenues, income before income taxes, and assets, to the Company s consolidated
totals (in 000 s):  

7.    COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES  

In
accordance with an Earn Out Promissory Note given to the prior owner of the Racetrack as part of the consideration paid by the
Company to acquire the Racetrack in 1994, if (i) off-track betting becomes legally permissible in the State of Minnesota and (ii)
the Company begins to conduct off-track betting with respect to or in connection with its operations, the Company will be required
to pay to the IMR Fund, L.P. the greater of $700,000 per operating year, as defined, or 20% of the net pretax profit, as defined
for each of five operating years. At this time, management believes that the likelihood that these two conditions will be met
and that the Company will be required to pay these amounts is remote. At the date (if any) that these two conditions are met,
the five minimum payments will be discounted back to their present value and the sum of those discounted payments will be capitalized
as part of the purchase price in accordance with GAAP. The purchase price will be further increased if payments become due under
the  20% of Net Pretax Profit  calculation. The first payment is to be made 90 days after the end of the third operating
year in which off-track betting is conducted by the Company. Remaining payments would be made within 90 days of the end of each
of the next four operating years.  

Additionally,
the Company entered into a Cooperative Marketing Agreement (the  CMA ) with the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community
( SMSC ) which became effective on June 15, 2012 and was amended in January 2015 and 2016. The CMA contains certain
covenants which, if breached, would trigger an obligation to repay a specified amount related to such covenant. At this time,
management believes that the likelihood that the breach of a covenant will occur and that the Company will be required to pay
the specified amount related to such covenant is remote.  

On
December 14, 2015, the Company entered into a five-year lease agreement for approximately 32 acres of land adjacent to the Racetrack.
The lease payments were payable monthly at $58,533, with an interest rate of 4.0% and a maturity date of December 15, 2020. The
capital lease obligation was paid in full on May 13, 2016, and the title to the land transferred to the Company.  

12  

The
Company is periodically involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Management believes
that the resolution of any pending claims and legal actions at September 30, 2016 and as of the date of this report will not have
a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial positions or results of operations.  

8.    COOPERATIVE
MARKETING AGREEMENT  

As
discussed in Note 7, on June 4, 2012, the Company entered into the CMA with the SMSC. The primary purpose of the CMA is to increase
purses paid during live horse racing at Canterbury Park s Racetrack in order to strengthen Minnesota s thoroughbred
and quarter horse industry. Under the CMA, as amended, this is achieved through  Purse Enhancement Payments to Horsemen 
paid directly to the MHBPA. Such payments have no direct impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or operations.  

Under
the terms of the CMA, the SMSC paid the horsemen $6.7 million and $6.2 million in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively,
primarily for purse enhancements for the live race meets in the respective years.  

Under
the CMA, as amended, SMSC also agreed to make  Marketing Payments  to the Company relating to joint marketing efforts
for the mutual benefit of the Company and SMSC, including signage, joint promotions, player benefits and events. Under the CMA,
the SMSC paid the Company $1,197,000 and $944,000 for marketing purposes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  

During
January 2015 and 2016, the CMA was amended to adjust the payment amounts between the  Purse Enhancement Payments to Horsemen 
and  Marketing Payments to Canterbury Park.  SMSC has currently agreed to make the following purse enhancement and
marketing payments for 2017 through 2022:  

The
amounts earned from the marketing payments are recorded as a component of other revenue and the related expenses are recorded
as a component of advertising and marketing expense and depreciation in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $610,000 in other revenue and incurred $440,000 in advertising
and marketing expense and $170,000 in depreciation related to the SMSC marketing payment. For the nine months ended September
30, 2015, the Company recorded $800,000 in other revenue and incurred $630,000 in advertising and marketing expense and $170,000
in depreciation related to the SMSC marketing payment. The excess of amounts received over revenue is reflected as deferred revenue
which is included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets.  

Under
the CMA, the Company agreed for the term of the CMA that it would not promote or lobby the Minnesota legislature for expanded
gambling authority and will support the SMSC s lobbying efforts against expanding gambling authority.  

13  

As
part of the CMA, and pursuant to a related SAR Agreement dated June 14, 2012, the Company issued stock appreciation rights to
the SMSC. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized $142,000 of expense related to these stock appreciation
rights, of which $142,000 was recorded as an offset to other revenue. On July 30, 2015, the Company sold the land and buildings
related to the Shakopee Valley RV Park located in Shakopee, Minnesota to SMSC for $100,000 plus the cancellation of the vested
and unvested SARs. As a result, there was no expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

9.    SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS  

During
October 2016, the Company received additional insurance proceeds of $592,000 from multiple severe storms during 2014 that
caused damage to buildings at the Track. As of September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a $592,000 insurance recoveries
gain in the  Consolidated Statements of Operations  as  Gain on insurance recoveries . Based on future
events, the Company may receive additional insurance proceeds. The Company has concluded that these additional funds
represent contingent gains and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, has not recorded an estimate for any additional future
proceeds in the Company s 2016 third quarter financial statements.  

On
November 11, 2016, the Company entered into a new general credit and security agreement with Bremer Bank, which provides a
revolving credit line of up to $6,000,000 and expires on November 11, 2017. The line of credit is collateralized by all
receivables, inventory, equipment, and general intangibles of the Company.

ITEM
                           2:     MANAGEMENT S
                                         DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The
following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A )
is intended to help the reader understand Canterbury Park Holding Corporation, our operations, our financial results and financial
condition and our present business environment. This MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction
with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (the  Notes ).  

Overview:

Canterbury
Park Holding Corporation (the  Company,   we,   our,  or  us ) conducts pari-mutuel
wagering operations and hosts  unbanked  card games at its Canterbury Park Racetrack and Card Casino facility (the
 Racetrack ) in Shakopee, Minnesota, which is approximately 25 miles southwest of downtown Minneapolis. The Racetrack
is the only facility in the State of Minnesota that offers live pari-mutuel thoroughbred and quarter horse racing.  

The
Company s pari-mutuel wagering operations include both wagering on thoroughbred and quarter horse races during live meets
at the Racetrack each year from May through September and year-round wagering on races held at out-of-state racetracks that are
televised simultaneously at the Racetrack ( simulcasting ). Unbanked card games, in which patrons compete against
each other, are hosted in the Card Casino at the Racetrack. The Card Casino operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Card
Casino offers both poker and table games at up to 80 tables. The Company also derives revenues from related services and activities,
such as concessions, parking, advertising signage, publication sales, and from other entertainment events and activities held
at the Racetrack.  

Recent
Reorganization . The Company was incorporated as a Minnesota corporation in October 2015. The Company is a successor corporation
to another corporation, also named Canterbury Park Holding Corporation, that was incorporated in 1994 ( CPHC ). Effective
as of the close of business on June 30, 2016, CPHC s business and operations were reorganized into a holding company structure
(the  Reorganization ) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March 1, 2016 that was approved by
CPHC s shareholders on June 28, 2016.  

Further
information regarding the Reorganization is set forth at Note 1 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under
Part I above and in the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-210877) filed with the SEC on April 22,
2016, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  

For
purposes of this Report on Form 10-Q, when the term  Company  is used with reference to information covering or related
to periods up to and including June 30, 2016, such term refers to the operations of CPHC prior to the Reorganization.  

Operations
Review for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016:    

EBITDA    

EBITDA
represents earnings before interest income, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain
non-recurring items to provide a better measure of the Company s core operating results and to provide period-to-period
comparisons. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), and should not be considered an alternative
to, or more meaningful than, net income as an indicator of our operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as
a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have been presented as a supplemental disclosure because they are widely used
measures of performance and a basis for valuation of companies in our industry. Moreover, other companies that provide EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA information may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, Adjusted EBITDA excluded the gain on sale of land, gain on disposal of assets and gain on insurance recoveries.  

15   

The
following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, a GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (defined above),
which is a non-GAAP measure, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Adjusted
EBITDA decreased $1,027,000, or 23.9%, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 8.0% from 10.3% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to the decline in revenues and an increase
in salaries and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  

Revenues:    

Total
net revenues decreased $102,000, or 0.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015. This decrease primarily consists of decreases in pari-mutuel and Card Casino revenue of 8.6% and 1.1%, respectively,
partially offset by an increase in food and beverage revenue of 4.4%. Total net revenues decreased $598,000, or 1.4%, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease primarily consists
of decreases in pari-mutuel, Card Casino and food and beverage revenue of 7.1%, 0.8% and 1.0%, respectively. The following discussion
provides further information regarding our operating revenues.  

Pari-mutuel
Data Revenues:     

16   

During 2016, the Company implemented a live racing
take-out reduction to become the lowest take-out racetrack in the industry to promote our racing on a national scale. As indicated
in the table above, total handle wagered increased $789,000, or 1.2%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
same period last year. 

The increase in total handle is primarily attributable
to the following factors. Out-of-state handle increased by $2,543,000, or 8.9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to the same period in 2015. The increase was partially offset by a 3.0% decrease in live racing handle primarily due to one less
day of racing and a 6.0% decrease in simulcast handle due in part to the lack of a Triple Crown contender in 2016. 

The increase in out-of-state wagering volume didn t
offset the take-out rate reduction for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.
Pari-mutuel revenue decreased $332,000, or 8.5%, and $613,000, or 7.1%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. In addition, the decrease in revenue is attributable to the decline in simulcast
and live racing handle. 

Card
Casino Revenue:     

The
primary source of Card Casino revenue is a percentage of the wagers received from the players as compensation for providing the
Card Casino facility and services, which is referred to as  collection revenue.  Other Revenue presented above includes
fees collected for the administration of tournaments and amounts earned as reimbursement of the administrative costs of maintaining
jackpot funds.  

As
indicated in the table above, total Card Casino revenue decreased $182,000 or 0.8%, for the three and nine months, respectively,
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. Card Casino revenue was relatively flat for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.  

Food
and Beverage Revenue:     

Food
and beverage revenue increased $146,000, or 4.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in
2015. The increase is attributable to increased catering sales and price increases on select menu items. Food and beverage revenue
decreased $71,000, or 1.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily attributable
to the loss of a major annual musical festival hosted in 2015 due to the sale of our festival field land as noted below in  Gain
on sale of land .  

Other
Revenue:     

Other
revenue increased $157,000, or 7.2%, September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. This increase is primarily due to
increased advertising revenue payments under the CMA agreement for joint marketing efforts.  

Operating
Expenses:    

Total
operating expenses decreased $273,000, or 1.8%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.
Total operating expenses increased $432,000, or 1.1%, excluding the gain on sale of land of $3,991,000 in 2016, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The following paragraphs provide further detail regarding operating
expenses.  

17   

Purse
expense decreased $209,000, or 8.8%, and $293,000, or 5.5%, for the three and nine months, respectively, ended September
30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The change is primarily due to a decrease in live racing handle and a change
in the statutory formula by which our purse expense is determined. Pursuant to legislation that took effect January 1, purse
rates are now determined based on a single rate, rather than the variable rate depending on the time of the year that
was previously in effect. This change will cause our purse expense in the fiscal year to be higher in the first and
fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters when compared to payments calculated under the previous
statutory structure. However, the change is not expected to have any material impact on our purse expense on an
annual basis.  

Salaries
and benefits increased $90,000, or 1.5%, and $658,000, or 4.0%, for the three and nine months, respectively, ended September 30,
2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase is primarily due to the State of Minnesota mandated increase in the minimum
wage from $8.00 per hour to $9.00 per hour effective August 1, 2015 to $9.50 per hour effective August 1, 2016.  

The
gain on sale of land is due to the sale of approximately 24 acres of land adjacent to the Racetrack for a total consideration
of $4.3 million.   

The
gain on disposal of assets is due to sale of the land and buildings related to the Shakopee Valley RV Park to SMSC during 2015.
The purchase price paid by SMSC for these assets was $100,000 and the cancellation of an agreement granting stock
appreciation rights with a liability carrying value of $641,000 that the Company issued to SMSC pursuant to the CMA. The
Company recorded a gain of $347,000.  

During
2014, the Company incurred damage to buildings from multiple severe storms at the Racetrack. As of September 30, 2015,
the Company recognized a $120,000 insurance recoveries gain in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as  Gain
on insurance recoveries . During October 2016, the Company received additional insurance proceeds of $592,000. As
of September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a $592,000 insurance recoveries gain as a  Recognized
Subsequent Event  in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as  Gain on insurance recoveries , in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The storms did not cause any material interruptions to the business or impact on the
Company s consolidated financial results of operations. Based on future events, the Company may receive additional
insurance proceeds. The Company has concluded that these additional funds represent contingent gains and in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, has not recorded an estimate for any additional future proceeds in the Company s 2016 third quarter
consolidated financial statements.  

Other
operating expenses increased $392,000, or 11.6%, and $22,000, or 0.3%, for the three and nine months, respectively, ended September
30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The changes are primarily attributable to the implementation of a new human capital
management software system, and professional fees related to an announced corporate restructuring and efforts to develop unused
or underutilized land.  

Income
tax expense increased $59,000, or 10.3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.
Income tax expense increased $1,720,000, or 94.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period
in 2015. The effective rate was comparable year-over-year, but the increase in deferred tax expense is attributable to
recording a deferred tax liability on the gain on sale of the land and gain on insurance recoveries.  

Net
Income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $926,000 and $813,000, respectively. Net Income for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,511,000 and $1,773,000, respectively.  

Contingencies:

The
Company entered into a Cooperative Marketing Agreement (the  CMA ) with the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community which
became effective on June 4, 2012, and was amended in January 2015 and 2016. The CMA contains certain covenants which, if breached,
would trigger an obligation to repay a specified amount related to such covenant. At this time, management believes that the likelihood
that the breach of a covenant would occur and that the Company would be required to pay the specified amount related to such covenant
is remote.  

The
Company continues to analyze the feasibility of various options related to the development of our underutilized land. The Company
may incur substantial costs during the feasibility and predevelopment process, but the Company believes available funds are sufficient
to cover the costs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on liquidity and capital resource requirements.  

18   

Liquidity
and Capital Resources:    

Net
cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,543,000 primarily as a result of the
following: The Company reported net income of $3,511,000, depreciation of $1,867,000, and deferred income taxes of $1,215,000. The
Company also experienced an increase in accounts payable of $1,634,000 and Card Casino accruals of $791,000. This was partially
offset by an increase in restricted cash of $574,000 and due from Minnesota horsemen associations of $1,101,000, and partially
offset by the gain on disposal of assets relating to the sale of land of $3,990,000 and gain on insurance recoveries of $592,000.  

Net
cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $4,142,000 primarily as a result of the
following: The Company reported net income of $1,773,000 and depreciation of $1,739,000. The Company also experienced an increase
in accounts payable of $1,104,000 and Card Casino accruals of $540,000. This was partially offset by an increase in net income
taxes paid of approximately $433,000 and other current assets of $413,000.  

Net
cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of 2016 was $3,777,000, primarily for building remodel projects and
the purchase of land. Net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of 2015 of $3,622,000 was primarily for
a variety of equipment purchases and building remodel projects.  

Net
cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2016 was $2,589,000, primarily for principal payments of capital
lease obligations and payment of cash dividends to shareholders. Net cash used in financing activities during the first nine months
of 2015 was $942,000 primarily for the payment of cash dividends.  

The
Company had a general credit and security agreement with Bremer Bank, which provided a revolving credit line of up to $3,000,000
and expired on September 30, 2016. The Company had no borrowings under the credit line during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015. This general credit line was replaced with a new agreement, see below.  

On
November 11, 2016, the Company signed a new general credit and security agreement with Bremer Bank, which provides a revolving
credit line of up to $6,000,000 and expires on November 11, 2017. The line of credit is collateralized by all receivables, inventory,
equipment, and general intangibles of the Company.  

The
Company s cash and cash equivalent balance at September 30, 2016 was $ 4.4 million compared to $ 8.3 million at December
31, 2015. The Company believes that unrestricted funds available in its cash accounts, amounts available under its revolving line
of credit, along with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity and capital resource requirements
for regular operations, as well as predevelopment expenses during 2016. However, if the Company engages in real estate development,
additional financing would more than likely be required.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates:   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that
management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis,
management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are
presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with
certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.  

Our
significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report on Form
10-K. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of our consolidated financial statements.  

19   

Property
and Equipment  - We have significant capital invested in our property and equipment, which represents approximately 73.7% of
our total assets at September 30, 2016. We utilize our judgment in various ways including: determining whether an expenditure
is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset; determining the estimated useful lives of assets; and determining if or
when an asset has been impaired or has been disposed. Management periodically reviews the carrying value of property and equipment
for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of these assets with their related expected undiscounted future net cash
flows. If the sum of the related expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value, management would determine how
much of an impairment loss would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of
the asset. To date, we have determined that no impairment of these assets exists.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    Accounting guidance requires recognition of services provided in exchange for a share-based payment based
on the grant date fair market value. We utilize our judgment in determining the assumptions used to determine the fair value of
equity instruments granted using a Black-Scholes model.  

Commitments
and Contractual Obligations:   

On
June 4, 2012, and amended in January 2015 and 2016, the Company entered into the CMA with the SMSC that expires December 31, 2022.
See  Cooperative Marketing Agreement  below.   

Legislation:    

Minimum
Wage Legislation   

Legislation
that was enacted into law in 2014 increased the minimum wage that must be paid to most company employees from $7.25 to $8.00 on
August 1, 2014, and from $8.00 to $9.00 per hour on August 1, 2015. A further increase from $9.00 to $9.50 per hour went into
effect on August 1, 2016. In addition, starting January 1, 2018, the minimum wage will increase at the beginning of each year
by the rate of inflation with a maximum increase of up to 2.5% per year. Prior to August 1, 2014, the Company employed a large
number of individuals who received an hourly wage equal to or slightly above $7.25 per hour. As a result, this legislation had
an adverse impact in 2014 and 2015 and will continue to have an adverse impact in 2016 and beyond. We have implemented measures,
and will continue to implement measures, to mitigate the impact of this increase by raising our prices and/or reducing our employee
count. However, these measures could themselves have an adverse effect because higher prices and diminished service levels may
discourage customers from visiting the Racetrack. To the extent we are not able to implement such price increases and other cost
cutting measures, the increase in the minimum wage will adversely affect our net income.  

Advanced
Deposit Wagering Legislation   

During
May 2016, the Advanced Deposit Wagering ( ADW ) legislation was signed into law by the governor of Minnesota. The
bill will establish licensing criteria and regulatory oversight of ADW providers doing business in the State of Minnesota. This
would allow the Minnesota Racing Commission ( MRC ) to regulate pari-mutuel wagering already occurring in Minnesota
and allow Canterbury Park to contract for source market fees from this wagering. These source market fees from ADW handle from
Minnesota residents would benefit the Company, the MRC, Minnesota horseracing industry and Minnesota breeders although it may
also have a negative impact on handle as more customers may wager online. Currently, the Company is assessing the financial impact
of the new legislation and cannot estimate it at this time.  

Cooperative
Marketing Agreement:    

On
June 4, 2012, the Company entered into the CMA with the SMSC. The primary purpose of the CMA is to increase purses paid during
live horse racing at Canterbury Park s Racetrack in order to strengthen Minnesota s thoroughbred and quarter horse
industry. Under the CMA, as amended, this is achieved through  Purse Enhancement Payments to Horsemen  paid directly
to the MHBPA. Such payments have no direct impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or operations.  

Under
the terms of the CMA, the SMSC paid the horsemen $6.7 million and $6.2 million in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively,
primarily for purse enhancements for the live race meets in the respective years.  

20  

Under
the CMA, as amended, SMSC also agreed to make  Marketing Payments  to the Company relating to joint marketing efforts
for the mutual benefit of the Company and SMSC, including signage, joint promotions, player benefits and events. Under the CMA,
the SMSC paid the Company $1,197,000 and $944,000 for marketing purposes during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  

During
January 2015 and 2016, the CMA was amended to adjust the payment amounts between the  Purse Enhancement Payments to Horsemen 
and  Marketing Payments to Canterbury Park.   

SMSC
has currently agreed to make the following purse enhancement and marketing payments for 2017 through 2022:  

1
  Includes $100,000 each year payable to various horsemen associations  

The
amounts earned from the marketing payments are recorded as a component of other revenue and the related expenses are recorded
as a component of advertising and marketing expense and depreciation in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $610,000 in other revenue and incurred $440,000 in advertising
and marketing expense and $170,000 in depreciation related to the SMSC marketing payment. For the nine months ended September
30, 2015, the Company recorded $800,000 in other revenue and incurred $630,000 in advertising and marketing expense and $170,000
in depreciation related to the SMSC marketing payment. The excess of amounts received over revenue is reflected as deferred revenue
which is included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets.  

Under
the CMA, the Company agreed for the term of the CMA that it would not promote or lobby the Minnesota legislature for expanded
gambling authority and will support the SMSC s lobbying efforts against expanding gambling authority.  

As
part of the CMA, and pursuant to a related SAR Agreement dated June 14, 2012, the Company issued stock appreciation rights to
the SMSC. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized $142,000 of expense related to these stock appreciation
rights, of which $142,000 was recorded as an offset to other revenue. On July 30, 2015, the Company sold the land and buildings
related to the Shakopee Valley RV Park located in Shakopee, Minnesota to SMSC for $100,000 plus the cancellation of the vested
and unvested SARs. As a result, there was no expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Forward-Looking
Statements:

time-to-time, in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in press releases, and in other communications to
shareholders or the investing public, we may make forward-looking statements concerning possible or anticipated future financial

 anticipates,   intends  or similar expressions. For such forward-looking statements, we claim the protection
of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in federal securities laws. Shareholders and the investing public

races at the Racetrack, at other tracks, or on unbanked card games offered at the Card Casino, competition from other venues offering
unbanked card games or other forms of wagering, a greater than anticipated expenses or lower than anticipated return on our development
of our underutilized land. competition from other sports and entertainment options, increases in compensation and employee benefit
costs, increases in the percentage of revenues allocated for purse fund payments, higher than expected expenses related to new
marketing initiatives, the impact of wagering products and technologies introduced by competitors, legislative and regulatory
decisions and changes, the general health of the gaming sector, and other factors that are beyond our ability to control or predict.

a.    All
                                         significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
                                         control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                                         registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
                                         and

                                         fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
                                         a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
