EXPLANATORY NOTE    
    
  This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016   of Liberty Property Trust and Liberty Property Limited Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to the  Trust  mean Liberty Property Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, and references to the  Operating Partnership  mean Liberty Property Limited Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms the  Company,   we,   our  and  us  mean the Trust and the Operating Partnership, collectively. 
    
  The Trust is a self-administered and self-managed Maryland real estate investment trust ( REIT ).  Substantially all of the Trust's assets are owned directly or indirectly, and substantially all of the Trust's operations are conducted directly or indirectly, by its subsidiary, the Operating Partnership, a Pennsylvania limited partnership. 
    
  The Trust is the sole general partner and also a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, owning   97.7%   of the common equity of the Operating Partnership at   September 30, 2016  .  The common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (the  Common Units ), other than those owned by the Trust, are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis (subject to anti-dilution protections) for the Trust's common shares of beneficial interest, $0.001 par value per share (the  Common Shares ).  
    
  The financial results of the Operating Partnership are consolidated into the financial statements of the Trust. The Trust has no significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. The Trust and the Operating Partnership are managed and operated as one entity. The Trust and the Operating Partnership have the same managers.   
    
  The Trust's sole business purpose is to act as the general partner of the Operating Partnership. Net proceeds from equity issuances by the Trust are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units. The Trust itself does not issue any indebtedness, but guarantees certain of the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership.  
    
  We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Trust and the Operating Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits: 
             
    enhances investors' understanding of the Trust and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
                
    eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the Company's disclosure applies to both the Trust and the Operating Partnership; and 
                
    creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
       
  To help investors understand the significant differences between the Trust and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of the Trust and the Operating Partnership:  
             
    consolidated financial statements; 
                
    the following notes to the consolidated financial statements; 
                
    Income per Common Share of the Trust and Income per Common Unit of the Operating Partnership; 
                
    Noncontrolling Interests of the Trust and Limited Partners' Equity and Noncontrolling Interest of the Operating Partnership 
       
  This report also includes separate Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Trust and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each entity have made the requisite certifications and that the Trust and Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Liberty Property Trust and Liberty Property Limited Partnership 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
  September 30, 2016    
   
  Note 1: Organization and Basis of Presentation 
  Organization 
  Liberty Property Trust (the  Trust ) is a self-administered and self-managed Maryland real estate investment trust (a  REIT ). Substantially all of the Trust s assets are owned directly or indirectly, and substantially all of the Trust s operations are conducted directly or indirectly, by its subsidiary, Liberty Property Limited Partnership, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (the  Operating Partnership  and, together with the Trust and their consolidated subsidiaries, the  Company ). The Trust is the sole general partner and also a limited partner of the Operating Partnership, owning   97.7%   of the common equity of the Operating Partnership at   September 30, 2016  . The Company owns and operates industrial properties nationally and owns and operates office properties in a focused group of office markets. Additionally, the Company owns certain assets in the United Kingdom. Unless otherwise indicated, the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both the Trust and the Operating Partnership. The terms the  Company,    we,   our  and  us  mean the Trust and Operating Partnership collectively.  
  As of January 1, 2016 under the revised accounting standard Topic 810 (see Recently Issued Accounting Standards below), the Operating Partnership is a variable interest entity ("VIE") of the Trust as the limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights. The Trust is the primary beneficiary of the Operating Partnership as it has the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership and the rights to absorb   97.7%   of the net income of the Operating Partnership. The Trust has no significant assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. As the Operating Partnership is already consolidated in the balance sheets of the Trust, the identification of this entity as a VIE has no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Trust. In addition, the Company holds a   20%   interest in Liberty/Comcast 1701 JFK Boulevard, LP which was determined to be a VIE. The Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary as the Company and its third party partner share control of the joint venture. The Company's maximum exposure to loss is equal to its equity investment in the joint venture which was   $19.3 million   and   $20.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for these interim periods have been included. The results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ("ASU 2014-09"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard clarifies the required factors that an entity must consider when recognizing revenue. The standard also requires additional disclosures concerning contracts with customers, judgments concerning revenue recognition, and assets recognized for the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on its financial position and results of operations and has not yet selected a transition method. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (Topic 810)   ("ASU 2015-02"). The standard requires that all entities re-evaluate and revise consolidation documentation for limited partnerships and similar legal entities. It makes changes to both the variable interest model and voting model. The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption of ASU 2016-02 is permitted. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company is evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial position and results of operations.

     Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05,   Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships   ("ASU 2016-05"). ASU 2016-05 states that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under FASB Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. ASU 2016-05 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017.  Early adoption of ASU 2016-05 is permitted. The standard allows application on a prospective or modified retrospective basis.  The Company does not believe that ASU 2016-05 will have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 is designed to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017.  Early adoption of ASU 2016-09 is permitted.  Certain amendments in the standard are to be applied retrospectively and certain amendments are to be applied prospectively. The Company is evaluating the impact ASU 2016-09 will have on its financial position and results of operations. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 is designed to clarify how entities should classify cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption of ASU 2016-15 is permitted. The standard requires retrospective application unless it is impracticable to do so. The Company is evaluating the impact ASU 2016-15 will have on its statement of cash flows. 
   
  Note 2:  Income per Common Share of the Trust 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income per common share of the Trust (in thousands except per share amounts): 

Dilutive shares for long-term compensation plans represent the unvested common shares outstanding during the periods as well as the dilutive effect of outstanding options. The amount of anti-dilutive options excluded from the computation of diluted income per common share for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   160,000   and   762,000  , respectively, as compared to   2,260,000   and   1,528,000  , respectively, for the same periods in   2015  . 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   241,000   and   353,000   common shares, respectively, were issued upon the exercise of options. During the year ended   December 31, 2015  ,   65,000   common shares were issued upon the exercise of options.

Share Repurchase 
  In August 2015, the Company s Board of Trustees authorized a share repurchase plan under which the Company may purchase up to   $250 million   of the Company s outstanding common shares. Purchases made pursuant to the program may be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased an aggregate of   1.4 million   common shares for   $40.9 million   at an average price of   $29.28   per share as part of the share repurchase plan. There were   no   such purchases during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Note 3:  Income per Common Unit of the Operating Partnership 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income per common unit of the Operating Partnership (in thousands, except per unit amounts): 

Dilutive units for long-term compensation plans represent the unvested common units outstanding during the periods as well as the dilutive effect of outstanding options. The amount of anti-dilutive options excluded from the computation of diluted income per common unit for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   160,000   and   762,000  , respectively, as compared to   2,260,000   and   1,528,000  , respectively, for the same periods in   2015  . 
  During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   241,000   and   353,000   common units, respectively, were issued upon exercise of options. During the year ended   December 31, 2015  ,   65,000   common units were issued upon the exercise of options. 
  Share Repurchase 
  In August 2015, the Company s Board of Trustees authorized a share repurchase plan under which the Company may purchase up to   $250 million   of the Company s outstanding common units. Purchases made pursuant to the program may be made in either the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements.

Note 7: Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  Asset Impairment 
    
  The Company disposes of and anticipates the potential disposition of certain properties prior to the end of their remaining useful lives. There were   no   impairments recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company did not recognize any impairments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized   $16.8 million   in impairments,   $13.4 million   of which related to the Company's Carolinas/Richmond reportable segment,   $2.3 million   of which related to the Company's Southeastern Pennsylvania reportable segment and   $1.0 million   of which related to the Company's DC Metro reportable segment. The properties included in the Carolinas/Richmond reportable segment were subsequently sold. The Company determined these impairments based on third party offer prices and quoted offer prices for comparable transactions which are Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, respectively, according to the fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820. These measurements have occurred throughout the respective periods as circumstances arise, and the resulting estimates of fair value are not necessarily reflective of measurements at the period s end. The Company has evaluated each of its properties and land held for development and has determined that there were no additional valuation adjustments necessary at   September 30, 2016  . In addition, the Company applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the level of impairments recognized. Should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of the Company s assets, the Company could be required to record impairment charges in the future. 
   
  Note 8: Noncontrolling Interests of the Trust 
  Noncontrolling interests in the accompanying financial statements represent the interests of the common and preferred units in the Operating Partnership not held by the Trust. In addition, noncontrolling interests include third-party ownership interests in consolidated joint venture investments. 
  Common units 
  The common units of the Operating Partnership not held by the Trust outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   have the same economic characteristics as common shares of the Trust. The   3.5 million   outstanding common units of the Operating Partnership not held by the Trust share proportionately in the net income or loss and in any distributions of the Operating Partnership. The common units of the Operating Partnership not held by the Trust are redeemable at any time at the option of the holder. The Trust, as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, may at its option elect to settle the redemption in cash or through the exchange on a one-for-one basis with unregistered common shares of the Trust. The market value of the   3.5 million   outstanding common units based on the closing price of the common shares of the Trust at   September 30, 2016   was $  142.4 million  .

The common units of the Operating Partnership not held by the Trust are redeemable at any time at the option of the holder. The Trust, as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, may at its option elect to settle the redemption in cash or through the exchange on a one-for-one basis with unregistered common shares of the Trust. The market value of the   3.5 million   outstanding common units at   September 30, 2016   based on the closing price of the common shares of the Trust at   September 30, 2016   was $  142.4 million  .

  Note 11: Indebtedness 
    
  In September 2016, the Company issued   $400 million   of   3.25%   senior unsecured notes due 2026. The Company used a substantial portion of the net proceeds from these notes to prepay its   5.5%   Senior Notes due December 2016 in the amount of   $300 million  . This prepayment resulted in a   $3.8 million   loss on debt extinguishment. 

Note 12: Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by management using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value. Accordingly, the following estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized on disposition of the financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 
    
  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest, dividend and distributions payable and other liabilities are reasonable estimates of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the outstanding amounts under the Company's credit facility is a reasonable estimate of fair value because interest rates float at a rate based on LIBOR. 
    
  The Company determines the fair value of its interest rate swaps by using the standard methodology of netting discounted future fixed cash payments with the discounted expected variable cash receipts. These variable cash receipts of interest rate swaps are based on expectations of future LIBOR interest rates (forward curves) estimated by observing market LIBOR interest rate curves. This is a Level 2 fair value calculation. Also, credit valuation adjustments are factored into the fair value calculations to account for potential nonperformance risk. These credit valuation adjustments were concluded to be not significant inputs for the fair value calculations for the periods presented. See Note 14 - Derivative Instruments. 
    
  The Company used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of its debt as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. This is a Level 3 fair value calculation. The inputs used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include actual maturity dates and scheduled cash flows as well as estimates for market value discount rates. The Company updates the  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

discounted cash flow model on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the Company's debt holdings and changes to discount rate assumptions.  
  The following summarizes the fair value of the Company's mortgage loans and unsecured notes as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

Note 13:  Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  Liberty Washington, LP 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, Liberty Washington LP (a joint venture in which the Company holds a   25%   interest) sold   nine   properties located in Northern Virginia containing   593,000   square feet and   6.0   acres of land for   $106.7 million  . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the joint venture sold   12   properties located in Northern Virginia containing   1.2   million square feet and   6.0   acres of land for   $187.2 million  .  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to adverse conditions in the Northern Virginia office market,   six   properties containing   698,000   square feet were transferred to mortgage lenders in satisfaction of an aggregate of   $112.5 million   in nonrecourse mortgage loans that were secured by the properties. The book values of these properties had been written down to fair value in prior periods.  
  Because these loans were nonrecourse, the Company believes that the transfers described above will not have an ongoing effect on its operating results or financial condition. 
  The Company's share of gain from property dispositions and extinguishment of debt is included in equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company's share of gain from extinguishment of debt was   $4.2 million  . There was   no   such gain during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company's share of gain on property dispositions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $4.0 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively.  
  Liberty Illinois, LP 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, Liberty Illinois, LP (a joint venture in which the Company holds a   25%   interest) sold   four   properties containing   636,000   square feet for   $32.5 million  . The Company's share of gain on property dispositions was   $1.0 million  . There were no other sales by this joint venture during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Cambridge Medipark Ltd 
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Cambridge Medipark, Ltd (a joint venture in which the Company holds a   50%   interest) recognized gains on the sale of land leasehold interests. The Company's share of these gains was   $3.3 million   and   $3.5 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $89,000   and   $4.8 million  , respectively, for the same periods in 2015.

Note 14: Derivative Instruments 
  The Company borrows funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility and certain bank mortgage loans bear interest at variable rates. Our long-term debt typically bears interest at fixed rates. The Company's interest rate risk management objectives are to limit generally the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the Company's overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, the Company enters into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars, swaps, caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. The Company generally does not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. The interest rate on all of the Company's variable rate debt is generally adjusted at one or three month intervals, subject to settlements under interest rate hedge contracts. 
  Interest rate swaps involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (for the Trust) and general partner's equity and limited partners' equity - common units (for the Operating Partnership) and is subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
  The Company determines the fair value of its interest rate swaps by using the standard methodology of netting discounted future fixed cash payments with the discounted expected variable cash receipts. These variable cash receipts of interest rate swaps are based on expectations of future LIBOR interest rates (forward curves) estimated by observing market LIBOR interest rate curves. This is a Level 2 fair value calculation. Also, credit valuation adjustments are factored into the fair value calculations to account for potential nonperformance risk. These credit valuation adjustments were concluded to be not significant inputs for the fair value calculations for the periods presented. 
  The Company holds an interest in   three   interest rate swap contracts ( Swaps ) that eliminate the impact of changes in interest rates on the payments required under variable rate mortgages. The Swaps had aggregate notional amounts of   $99.5 million   and   $101.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and expire at various dates between   2018   and   2020  . 
  The Company accounts for the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassifies the effective portion to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company accounts for the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative directly in earnings.  
  The following table presents the location in the financial statements of the gains or losses recognized related to the Company s cash flow hedges for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands):      

  The fair value of the Swaps in the amounts of   $6.9 million   and   $7.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company estimates that   $0.8 million   will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an increase to interest expense over the next 12 months. 
  The Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including defaults where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. If the Company were to breach any of the contractual provisions of the derivative contracts, it would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value including accrued interest, which totaled approximately   $7.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .

  Substantially all of the Company's properties and land were subject to Phase I Environmental Assessments and when appropriate Phase II Environmental Assessments (collectively, the  Environmental Assessments ) obtained in contemplation of their acquisition by the Company or obtained by predecessor owners prior to the sale of the property or land to the Company. The Environmental Assessments did not reveal, nor is the Company aware of, any non-compliance with environmental laws, environmental liability or other environmental claim that the Company believes would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
  Operating Ground Lease Agreements 
  Future minimum rental payments under the terms of all non-cancelable operating ground leases under which the Company is the lessee, as of   September 30, 2016  , were as follows (in thousands): 

Operating ground lease expense for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $241,000   and   $734,000  , respectively, as compared to   $224,000   and   $536,000  , respectively, for the same periods in   2015  . 
  Legal Matters 
  From time to time, the Company is a party to a variety of legal proceedings, claims and assessments arising in the normal course of business. As of   September 30, 2016   there were   no   legal proceedings, claims or assessments that the Company expects to have a material adverse effect on the Company s business or financial statements. 
  Other 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had letter of credit obligations of   $7.5 million  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   25   buildings under development. These buildings are expected to contain, when completed, a total of   6.6 million   square feet of leasable space and represent an anticipated aggregate investment of   $606.2 million  .  At   September 30, 2016  , development in progress totaled   $427.7 million  . In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had invested   $11.3 million   in deferred leasing costs related to these development buildings. Also, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had signed an agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to develop an office building with a cost of approximately   $96 million   on land to be owned by the future occupant of the building and with funds to be advanced by the future occupant, and to guarantee the timely lien-free completion of construction of the building and the payment, subject to certain exceptions, of any cost overruns in the development of the building, all in consideration for a development fee payable to the Company. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was committed to   $38.4 million   in improvements on certain buildings and land parcels. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was committed to   $29.4 million   in future land purchases. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was obligated to pay for tenant improvements not yet completed for a maximum of   $30.8 million  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was committed to fund up to   $4.0 million   for tenant improvements and leasing commissions under a loan to the buyer of certain of the Company's properties. 
    
  Unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company holds an interest have engaged the Company as the developer of its development properties pursuant to development agreements. The Company agrees, in consideration for a development fee, to be

     Table of Contents  

responsible for all aspects of the development of the properties and to guarantee the timely lien-free completion of construction of the properties and the payment, subject to certain exceptions, of any cost overruns incurred in the development of the properties. The Company is currently developing   three   buildings for its unconsolidated joint ventures which represent an anticipated aggregate investment by the joint ventures of   $958.0 million  . 
  The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions. The combined account balances at each institution typically exceed FDIC insurance coverage and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. The Company believes the risk is not significant. 
   
  Note 16: Supplemental Disclosure to Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 
  The following are supplemental disclosures to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands): 

Amounts paid in cash for deferred leasing costs incurred in connection with signed leases with tenants are paid in conjunction with improving (acquiring) property, plant and equipment. Such costs are not contained within net real estate. However, they are integral to the completion of a tenant lease and ultimately are related to the improvement and thus the value of the Company s property, plant and equipment. They are therefore included in investing activities in the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows. 
   
  Note 17: Subsequent Events 
    
  On October 3, 2016, the Company completed the sale of   108   properties totaling approximately   7.6 million   square feet and   26.7   acres of land for   $969 million  . See Note 5: Real Estate for further details on this sale.

  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
   
  Overview 
  Liberty Property Trust (the  Trust ) is a self-administered and self-managed Maryland real estate investment trust ( REIT ). Substantially all of the Trust s assets are owned directly or indirectly, and substantially all of the Trust s operations are conducted directly or indirectly, by its subsidiary, Liberty Property Limited Partnership, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (the  Operating Partnership  and, collectively with the Trust and their consolidated subsidiaries, the  Company ). 
  The Company owns and operates industrial properties nationally and owns and operates office properties in a focused group of office markets. Additionally, the Company owns certain assets in the United Kingdom. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned and operated   488   industrial and   125   office properties (the  Wholly Owned Properties in Operation ) totaling   91.0 million   square feet. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   25   properties under development, which when completed are expected to comprise   6.6 million   square feet (the  Wholly Owned Properties under Development ) and 1,700 acres of developable land, substantially all of which is zoned for commercial use. Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had an ownership interest, through unconsolidated joint ventures, in   47   industrial and   14   office properties totaling   12.7 million   square feet (the  JV Properties in Operation  and, together with the Wholly Owned Properties in Operation, the  Properties in Operation ), three properties under development, which when completed are expected to comprise 1.7 million square feet and a 222-room hotel (the "JV Properties under Development" and, collectively with the Wholly Owned

     Table of Contents  

Properties under Development, the "Properties under Development" and, collectively with the Properties in Operation, the "Properties") and   385   acres of developable land, substantially all of which is zoned for commercial use.  
  On October 3, 2016, the Company completed the sale of   108   properties totaling approximately   7.6 million   square feet and   26.7   acres of land for   $969 million  . 
  The Company focuses on creating value for shareholders and increasing profitability and cash flow. With respect to its Properties in Operation, the Company endeavors to maintain high occupancy levels while maximizing rental rates and controlling costs. The Company pursues development opportunities that it believes will create value and yield acceptable returns. The Company also acquires properties that it believes will create long-term value, and disposes of properties that no longer fit within the Company s     strategic objectives or in situations where it can optimize cash proceeds. The Company expects its strategy with respect to product and market selection to continue to favor industrial and metro-office properties and markets with strong demographic and economic fundamentals. The Company also believes that long-term trends indicate potential erosion in the value of certain suburban office properties in certain markets.  Accordingly, the Company has increased its investment in industrial and metro-office properties and markets with strong demographic and economic fundamentals, and has decreased its investment in suburban office properties. Furthermore, the Company has accelerated this strategy during 2016, and to this end has executed the portfolio sale discussed above. The Company anticipates that this strategy will yield benefits over time, including a higher rate of rental growth and a lower level of lease transaction costs and other capital costs for industrial properties as opposed to suburban office properties. The Company also anticipates that this strategy will result in a gradual improvement in the average quality and geographic location of the Company s properties. The Company believes that the benefits of the strategy will greatly outweigh the short-term reduction in net cash from operating activities that results from the disposition of the suburban office assets. 
  The Company s operating results depend primarily upon income from rental operations and are substantially influenced by rental demand for the Properties in Operation. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, straight line rents on renewal and replacement leases were on average 7.3% and 7.8% higher than rents on expiring leases. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company leased 9.1 million and 19.9 million square feet, respectively, and, as of that date, attained occupancy of 95.3% for the Wholly Owned Properties in Operation and 97.2% for the JV Properties in Operation for a combined occupancy of 95.5% for the Properties in Operation. At   December 31, 2015  , occupancy for the Wholly Owned Properties in Operation was   93.9%   and for the JV Properties in Operation was   92.8%   for a combined occupancy for the Properties in Operation of   93.7%  .  
  Based on the Company s 2016 operating results to date and its current outlook for the remainder of the year, the Company anticipates that property level operating income for the Same Store (defined below) group of properties will increase for the full year of 2016, compared to 2015, driven primarily by new and renewal leases being completed at higher market rental rates than those of expiring leases. In addition, the Company expects to increase occupancy levels from those in 2015. This growth is largely driven by the rental rate growth and occupancy increases for the Company s industrial properties. 
  The Company also anticipates that the effect of the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union and the resulting change in the foreign exchange rate will not have a material effect on its net income or consolidated balance sheet during 2016. 
  The Company has disposed of a significant number of Operating Properties during 2016, including the portfolio sale noted above. The net proceeds of this sale are being used to repay outstanding borrowings under the Company s Credit Facility (defined below) as well as other outstanding indebtedness. The Company incurred a $3.8 million charge relating to the early extinguishment of debt during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company has given notice of its intent to to redeem on November 4, 2016 its 6.625% senior notes due October 2017 in the amount of $296.5 million and its 7.5% medium term notes due January 2018 in the amount of $100.0 million. With respect thereto, the Company expects to incur approximately $23.3 million in additional charges relating to the early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  The assumptions presented above are forward-looking and are based on the Company s future view of market and general economic conditions, as well as other risks outlined above under the caption  Forward-Looking Statements.   There can be no assurance that the Company s actual results will not differ materially from assumptions set forth above.  The Company assumes no obligation to update these assumptions in the future.

  Unconsolidated Joint Venture Capital Activity  
  The Company periodically enters into unconsolidated joint venture relationships in connection with the execution of its real estate operating strategy. 
  Acquisitions/Dispositions 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company holds a 25% interest sold 13 operating properties containing 1.2 million square feet and 6.0 acres of land for $139.2 million.

  In addition, due to adverse conditions in the Northern Virginia office market, the fair value of six properties owned by Liberty Washington, LP (an unconsolidated joint venture in which the Company holds a 25% interest) containing 698,000 square feet was determined to be less than the debt encumbering the properties. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the joint venture cooperated with the mortgage lenders in the transfer of the six properties to the lender in satisfaction of an aggregate of $112.5 million in nonrecourse mortgage debt. The book values of these properties had been written down to fair value in a prior period.  
  None of the unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company holds an interest acquired any operating properties or land parcels during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . Consistent with the Company's strategy, from time to time the Company may consider transferring assets to or purchasing assets from an unconsolidated joint venture in which the Company holds an interest.

  Properties in Operation 
  The composition of the Company s Properties in Operation as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows (square feet in thousands): 

(1)  Net rent represents the contractual rent per square foot at   September 30, 2016   or   2015   for tenants in occupancy.  Net rent does not include the tenant's obligation to pay property operating expenses and real estate taxes.  If a tenant was within a free rent period at   September 30, 2016   or   2015   its rent would equal zero for the purposes of this metric. 
  (2) Straight line rent and operating expense reimbursement represents the straight line rent including operating expense recoveries per square foot at   September 30, 2016   or   2015   for tenants in occupancy.

  Forward-Looking Statements 
  When used throughout this report, the words  believes,   anticipates,   estimates  and  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements indicate that assumptions have been used that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual financial results or management plans and objectives to differ materially from those projected or expressed herein, including: the effect of global, national and regional economic conditions; rental demand; the Company s ability to identify, and enter into agreements with suitable joint venture partners in situations where it believes such arrangements are advantageous; the Company s ability to identify and secure additional properties and sites, both for itself and the joint ventures to which it is a party, that meet its criteria for acquisition or development; the effect of prevailing market interest rates; risks related to the integration of the operations of entities that we have acquired or may acquire; risks related to litigation; and other risks described from time to time in the Company s filings with the SEC. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for a discussion of critical accounting policies which include capitalized costs, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of real estate, intangibles, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and derivative instruments and hedging activities. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes to these policies. 
  Results of Operations 
  The following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. It compares the results of operations of the Company for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   with the results of operations of the Company for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . As a result of the varying levels of development, acquisition and disposition activities by the Company in   2016   and   2015  , the overall operating results of the Company during such periods are not directly comparable. However, certain data, including the Same Store comparison, do lend themselves to direct comparison. 
  This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. 
   
  Comparison of Three and Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   to Three and Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Rental Revenue 
  Rental revenue was   $140.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $145.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . This decrease of   $4.3 million   was primarily due to the net result of decreased rental revenue related to property dispositions since January 1, 2015 offset by increased rental revenue related to acquisitions and completed development for the same period. This decrease was also partially offset by an increase in Same Store (defined below) property rental revenue of $2.1 million.

     Table of Contents  

Rental revenue was   $418.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $441.0 million   for the same period in 2015. This decrease of   $22.1 million   was primarily due to the net result of decreased rental revenue related to property dispositions since January 1, 2015 offset by increased rental revenue related to acquisitions and completed development for the same period. This decrease was also partially offset by an increase in Same Store (defined below) property rental revenue of $6.3 million. 
  Operating Expense Reimbursement 
  Operating expense reimbursement was   $50.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $54.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . This decrease of   $3.8 million   was primarily due to lower reimbursements associated with an aggregate decrease of $4.9 million in rental property expense and real estate taxes (as detailed below).  
  Operating expense reimbursement was   $148.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $168.4 million   for the same period in 2015. This decrease of   $19.6 million   was primarily due to lower reimbursements associated with an aggregate decrease of $21.3 million in rental property expense and real estate taxes (as detailed below). 
  Rental Property Expense 
  Rental property expense was   $26.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $31.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . This decrease of   $5.0 million   was primarily due to a reduction in expense associated with the sale of suburban office and high finish flex properties partially offset by increased expenses resulting from the acquisition and completed development of industrial properties. In addition, the decrease was due to a reduction in net bad debt expense. Rental property expense includes utilities, insurance, janitorial, landscaping, snow removal and other costs necessary to maintain a property. 
  Rental property expense was   $79.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $99.0 million   for the same period in 2015. This decrease of   $19.2 million   was primarily due to a reduction in expense associated with the sale of suburban office and high finish flex properties partially offset by increased expenses resulting from the acquisition and completed development of industrial properties. In addition, the decrease was due to a reduction in net bad debt expense and weather-related expenses. 
  Real Estate Taxes 
  Real estate taxes were   $26.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
  Real estate taxes were   $76.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $78.6 million   for the same period in 2015. This decrease of   $2.1 million   was primarily due to the net result of decreased real estate taxes related to property dispositions since January 1, 2015 offset by increased real estate taxes related to acquisitions and completed development for the same period. 
  Segments 
  The Company evaluates the performance of the Wholly Owned Properties in Operation in terms of net operating income by reportable segment (see Note 6 to the Company s financial statements for a reconciliation of this measure to net income). The following table identifies changes to net operating income in reportable segments (dollars in thousands): 

32 

     Table of Contents  

(1) 
    The increase was primarily due to an increase in average gross investment in operating real estate. 
              (2) 
    The increase was primarily due to increases in occupancy and average gross investment in operating real estate. 
              (3) 
    The increase was primarily due to an increase in occupancy and a reduction of certain expenses. 
              (4) 
    The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average gross investment in operating real estate. 
              (5) 
    The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the foreign exchange rate. 
     Same Store 
  Property level operating income, exclusive of termination fees, for the Same Store properties is identified in the table below. 
  The Same Store results were affected by changes in occupancy and rental rates as detailed below. 

(1) 
    Represents the average contractual rent per square foot for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015   for tenants in occupancy in Same Store properties.  Cash basis rent does not include the tenant's obligation to pay property operating expenses and real estate taxes.  If a tenant was within a free rent period its rent would equal zero for purposes of this metric. 
              (2) 
    Represents the average straight line rent including operating expense recoveries per square foot for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015   for tenants in occupancy in the Same Store properties. 
     Management generally considers the performance of the Same Store properties to be a useful financial performance measure because the results are directly comparable from period to period. In addition, Same Store property level operating income and Same Store cash basis property level operating income are considered by management to be more reliable indicators of the portfolio s baseline performance. The Same Store properties consist of the   580   properties totaling approximately   84.4 million   square feet owned on January 1,   2015  . Properties that were acquired, or on which development was completed, during the year ended   December 31, 2015   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are excluded from the Same Store properties.  Properties that were acquired, or on which development was completed, are included in Same Store when they have been purchased in the case of acquisitions, and placed into service in the case of completed development, prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented in the comparison.  The ten properties sold during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   81   properties sold during   2015   are also excluded. 
  Set forth below is a schedule comparing the property level operating income, on a straight line basis and on a cash basis, for the Same Store properties for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Same Store property level operating income and cash basis property level operating income are non-GAAP measures and do not represent operating income because they do not reflect all of the consolidated operations of the Company. Investors should review Same Store results, along with NAREIT Funds from operations (see  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below), GAAP net income and cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities when considering the Company s operating performance. Also set forth below is a reconciliation of Same Store property level operating income and cash basis property level operating income to net income (in thousands).

     Table of Contents  

Termination fees are fees that the Company agrees to accept in consideration for permitting certain tenants to terminate their leases prior to the contractual expiration date. Termination fees are included in rental revenue. 
  General and Administrative 
  General and administrative expenses increased to $  16.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  15.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and increased to   $52.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $51.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increases were primarily due to increases in severance costs. General and administrative expenses include salaries, wages and incentive compensation for general and administrative staff along with related costs, consulting, marketing, public company expenses, costs associated with the acquisition of properties and other general and administrative costs. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization decreased to $  46.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from $  55.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and decreased to   $154.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $171.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . These decreases were primarily due to the net result of decreased depreciation and amortization related to property dispositions since January 1, 2015 offset by increased depreciation and amortization related to acquisitions and completed development for the same period. The decreases were also due to a reduction in amortization of in-place lease intangibles.

Impairment - Real Estate Assets 
  There was no impairment - real estate assets for the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company recognized $16.8 million in impairment - real estate assets including $13.4 million in impairment expense related to the Company's Carolinas/Richmond reportable segment, $2.3 million in impairment expense related to the Company's Southeastern Pennsylvania reportable segment and $1.0 million in impairment expense related to the Company's DC Metro reportable segment. The properties included in the Carolinas/Richmond reportable segment were subsequently sold. 
  Interest and Other Income 
  Interest and other income decreased to   $3.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $5.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and decreased to   $12.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $17.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . These decreases were primarily related to decreases in gains associated with land development in the United Kingdom.  
  Loss on Debt Extinguishment 
  Loss on debt extinguishment was $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The loss on debt extinguishment was primarily due to a make-whole premium related to the Company's prepayment of its 5.5% Senior Notes due December 2016 in the amount of $300 million. There were no losses on debt extinguishment during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense decreased to   $29.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $33.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and decreased to   $91.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $103.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  The decrease for the three month periods was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate to 4.2% for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 4.6% for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   as well as an increase in capitalized interest, which was $7.1 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $4.6 million for the same period in 2015. Average debt outstanding decreased to   $3,190.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $3,192.2 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The decrease for the nine month periods was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate to 4.3% for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 4.7% for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   as well as an increase in capitalized interest, which was $18.4 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $12.0 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding to $3,193.2 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $3,142.2 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
  Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures increased to income of   $9.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a loss of   $0.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and increased to income of   $19.5 million   for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   $0.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . These increases were primarily due to an increase in gain on sale of operating properties and gain on debt forgiveness by unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company holds an interest. The Company's share of gain on sale related to unconsolidated joint ventures was $5.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to losses of $3.9 million and $11.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company's share of debt forgiveness gains was $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. There were no such gains in 2015. These results were also impacted by gains on the sale of land leasehold interests by an unconsolidated joint venture in which the Company holds an interest. The Company's share of these gains was   $3.3 million   and   $3.5 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $89,000   and   $4.8 million  , respectively, for the same periods in 2015. 
  Other 
  Gain on property dispositions decreased to   $1.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $53.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and decreased to   $25.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $57.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  As a result of the foregoing, the Company s net income decreased to $  55.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016    from   $93.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and increased to   $165.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $162.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  The Company seeks to maintain a conservative balance sheet and pursue a strategy of financial flexibility. The Company's liquidity requirements include operating and general and administrative expenses, shareholder distributions, funding its investment in development properties and joint ventures and satisfying interest requirements and debt maturities. The Company believes that proceeds from operating activities, asset sales, its available cash, borrowing capacity from its Credit Facility (as defined below) and its other sources of capital including the public debt and equity markets will provide it with sufficient funds to satisfy these obligations.  
  Activity 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of   $48.0 million  , including   $5.7 million   in restricted cash.   
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities decreased to   $286.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $299.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   $12.9 million   decrease was primarily due to a reduction in cash provided by operating activities associated with the properties sold during 2015 and 2016 offset by the operating activities of the acquisition and completed development properties. Net cash flow   provided by   operating activities is the primary source of liquidity to fund distributions to shareholders and for recurring capital expenditures and leasing transaction costs for the Company s Wholly Owned Properties in Operation. 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $259.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $188.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   $70.4 million   increase primarily resulted from the increased level of investment in development in progress. The change in investing activities related to acquisitions was offset by the change in investing activities related to dispositions. 
  Net cash   used in   financing activities was   $17.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $130.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . This   $112.3 million   decrease was primarily due to a reduction in mortgage loan repayments. Financing activities include proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity, debt repayments, equity repurchases and distributions. 
    
  In September 2016, the Company issued $400 million of 3.25% senior unsecured notes due 2026. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from these notes to prepay its 5.5% Senior Notes due December 2016 in the amount of $300 million. This prepayment resulted in a $3.8 million loss on debt extinguishment.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased an aggregate of 1.4 million common shares of the Company for $40.9 million as part of a share repurchase plan. There were no such purchases during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
  The Company funds its development activities, including its obligations associated with its joint venture development activity, and acquisitions with long-term capital sources and proceeds from the disposition of properties. When appropriate the Company also funds such activities with available capacity under its $800 million credit facility (the "Credit Facility"). The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Facility fluctuates based upon ratings from Moody s Investors Service, Inc., Standard and Poor s Ratings Group and Fitch, Inc. Based on the Company s existing ratings, the interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility at   September 30, 2016   was LIBOR plus 105 basis points.  There is also a 20 basis point annual facility fee on the current borrowing capacity.  The credit facility contains a competitive bid option, whereby participating lenders bid on the interest rate to be charged. This feature is available for up to 50% of the amount of the facility. 
  The Company uses debt financing to lower its overall cost of capital in an attempt to increase the return to shareholders. The Company staggers its debt maturities and maintains debt levels it considers to be prudent. In determining its debt levels, the Company considers various financial measures including the debt to gross assets ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s debt to gross assets ratio was   42%   and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.6x. Debt to gross assets equals total long-term debt and borrowings under the Credit Facility divided by total assets plus accumulated depreciation. The fixed charge coverage ratio equals income before property dispositions plus interest expense and depreciation and amortization (including the Company's pro rata share of depreciation and amortization related to unconsolidated joint ventures) divided by interest expense, including capitalized interest, plus distributions on preferred units. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $274.2 million   in mortgage loans and   $2,696.5 million   in unsecured notes were outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of   4.4%  . The interest rates on   $2,970.7 million   of mortgage loans and unsecured notes are fixed (including   $99.5 million   fixed via a swap arrangement - see Note 14 to the Company's financial statements) and range from   3.0%   to   7.5%  . The weighted average remaining term for the mortgage loans and unsecured notes is   6.2   years. 
  The scheduled principal amortization and maturities of the Company s mortgage loans, unsecured notes and the Credit Facility and the related weighted average interest rates as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

    Includes deferred financing costs, premium/discount and market adjustments. 
     Generally, the Company s objective is to meet its short-term liquidity requirement of funding the payment of its current level of quarterly preferred and common distributions to shareholders and unitholders through its net cash flows provided by operating activities, less tenant improvement, leasing costs and capital expenditures.  To the extent that net cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet its quarterly distributions to shareholders and unitholders, the Company utilizes Credit Facility borrowings to fund such distributions.   
  In July 2016, the Company s Board of Trustees declared a quarterly distribution to common shareholders and unitholders of $0.475

per share and unit for the third quarter of 2016. The Company currently expects to maintain the quarterly distribution payment rate to common shareholders and unitholders of $0.475 per share and unit for the remainder of 2016.  However, in light of the portfolio sale discussed below, and in light of the cumulative impact on the Company s business resulting from the strategic sales of real estate assets since 2011, among other factors, the Company expects that the Board of Trustees may decrease its current quarterly distribution to common shareholders and unitholders starting with the first quarter s distribution payment in April 2017. 
  Notwithstanding, future distribution payments by the Company will be paid at the discretion of the Board of Trustees and will depend on the Company's actual funds from operations and cash flows, the Company s financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors that the Board of Trustees deems relevant. The Company s Board of Trustees reviews the dividend quarterly, and there can be no assurance about the amount of future quarterly distribution payments. 
  As discussed above in the  Overview  section, the Company disposed of a significant number of Operating Properties in October of 2016 for an aggregate sales price of $969 million. The net proceeds of this sale are being used to repay outstanding borrowings on the Company s Credit Facility as well as other outstanding indebtedness. The Company gave notice on October 5, 2016 of its intention to redeem on November 4, 2016 its 6.625% senior notes due October 2017 in the amount of $296.5 million and its 7.5% medium term notes due January 2018 in the amount of $100.0 million. With respect thereto, the Company expects to incur charges relating to the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $23.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  General 
  The Company has an effective S-3 shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which the Trust and the Operating Partnership may issue an unlimited amount of equity securities and debt securities. 
   
  Calculation of Funds from Operations 
  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) has issued a standard definition for NAREIT Funds from operations (as defined below). The SEC has agreed to the disclosure of this non-GAAP financial measure on a per share basis in its Release No. 34-47226, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. The Company believes that the calculation of NAREIT Funds from operations is helpful to investors and management as it is a measure of the Company s operating performance that excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from dispositions of depreciable property. As a result, year over year comparison of NAREIT Funds from operations reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. In addition, management believes that NAREIT Funds from operations provides useful information to the investment community about the Company s financial performance when compared to other REITs since NAREIT Funds from operations is generally recognized as the standard for reporting the operating performance of a REIT. NAREIT Funds from operations available to common shareholders is defined by NAREIT as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP )), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. NAREIT Funds from operations available to common shareholders does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. NAREIT Funds from operations available to common shareholders also does not represent cash flows generated from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by GAAP.

NAREIT Funds from operations ( FFO ) available to common shareholders for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

Inflation 
  Inflation has remained relatively low in recent years, and as a result, it has not had a significant impact on the Company during this period.  To the extent an increase in inflation would result in increased operating costs, such as insurance, real estate taxes and utilities, substantially all of the tenants  leases require the tenants to absorb these costs as part of their rental obligations. In addition, inflation also may have the effect of increasing market rental rates.

   Redemption Price    has the meaning specified in Section 1.04(a) hereof. 
    
   Reinvestment Rate    means the yield on Treasury securities at a constant maturity corresponding to the remaining life (as of the date of redemption, and rounded to the nearest month) to the Par Call Date (the  Treasury Yield ), plus 25%. For purposes hereof, the Treasury Yield shall be equal to the arithmetic mean of the yields published in the Statistical Release under the heading  Week Ending  for  U.S. Government Securities - Treasury Constant Maturities  with a maturity equal to such remaining life (assuming the notes matured on the Par Call Date); provided, that if no published maturity exactly corresponds to such remaining life (assuming the notes matured on the Par Call Date), then the Treasury Yield shall be interpolated or extrapolated on a straight-line basis from the arithmetic means of the yields for the next shortest and next longest published maturities. For purposes of calculating the Reinvestment Rate, the most recent Statistical Release published prior to the date of determination of the redemption amount shall be used. If the format or content of the Statistical Release changes in a manner that precludes determination of the Treasury Yield in the above manner, then the Treasury Yield shall be determined in the manner that most closely approximates the above manner, as reasonably determined by the Company.  
    
  (c) With respect to the securities of all series created on or after the date of this Sixth Supplemental Indenture, the term  Unencumbered Total Asset Value , which is defined in the Base Indenture, shall have the following meaning: 
    
     Unencumbered Total Asset Value    as of any date means the sum of: (i) the value of those Undepreciated Real Estate Assets not subject to an encumbrance; and (ii) the value of all other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis not subject to an encumbrance, as determined in accordance with GAAP (but excluding accounts receivable and intangibles); provided, however, that all investments by the Company and its Subsidiaries in unconsolidated joint ventures, unconsolidated limited partnerships, unconsolidated limited liability companies and other unconsolidated entities shall be excluded from Unencumbered Total Asset Value to the extent that such investments would have otherwise been included. 
    
  (d) The term  Make-Whole Amount , which is defined in the Base Indenture, shall not apply to the Notes. 
    
  SECTION 1.02   Creation of the Debt Securities  . In accordance with Section 301 of the Base Indenture, the Company hereby creates the Notes as a separate series of its debt securities issued pursuant to the Indenture. The Notes shall be issued in an aggregate principal amount initially limited to $400,000,000.  
    
  The Company may issue, in addition to the Notes originally issued on the Closing Date, additional Notes. The Notes originally issued on the Closing Date and any additional Notes originally issued subsequent to the Closing Date shall be a single series for all purposes under the Indenture.  
    
  SECTION 1.03   Form of the Debt Securities  . The Notes will be represented by one or more fully-registered global notes in book-entry form, without coupons, registered in the name of the nominee of DTC. The Notes shall be in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto and the terms set forth in such form shall be incorporated herein. So long as DTC, or its nominee, is the registered owner of a Global Note, DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture. Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Note will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to beneficial interests of participants) or by participants or persons that hold interests through participants (with respect to beneficial interests of beneficial owners).     

SECTION 1.04   Terms and Conditions of the Debt Securities  . The Notes shall be governed by all the terms and conditions of the Base Indenture, as supplemented by this Sixth Supplemental Indenture, and in particular, the following provisions shall be the terms of the Notes:  
  (a)   Optional Redemption  . At any time prior to the Par Call Date, the Company may redeem the Notes at its option, in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price (the  Redemption Price ) equal to the greater of (i) the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed that would be due if such notes matured on the Par Call Date but for the redemption thereof (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Reinvestment Rate plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the Redemption Date; provided, however, that if the Redemption Date falls after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the Company will pay the full amount of accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, due on such Interest Payment Date to the Holder of record at the close of business on the corresponding Regular Record Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Notes are redeemed on or after the Par Call Date, the Redemption Price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date.   
    
  If notice of redemption has been given as provided in the Indenture and funds for the redemption of the Notes called for redemption shall have been made available on the Redemption Date referred to in such notice, such Notes will cease to bear interest on the date fixed for such redemption specified in such notice and the only right of the Holders of such Notes from and after the Redemption Date will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price upon surrender of such Notes in accordance with such notice.  
    
  Notice of any optional redemption of any Notes will be given to Holders at their addresses, as shown in the Security Register for the Notes, not more than 60 nor less than 15 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. The notice of redemption will specify, among other items, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price and the principal amount of the Notes held by such Holder to be redeemed.  
    
  If all or less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at the option of the Company, the Company will notify the Trustee at least 45 days prior to giving notice of redemption (or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee) of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be redeemed and their Redemption Date. In connection with any redemption prior to the Par Call Date, the Company shall give the Trustee notice of the related Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and if the Company has requested that the Trustee give to the Holders the notice of redemption required by Section 1104 of the Base Indenture, such notice from the Company shall be given to the Trustee at such time as shall permit the Trustee to include notice of the Redemption Price in such notice of redemption. The Trustee shall have no responsibility for calculating the Redemption Price. The Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem fair and appropriate, no less than 60 days prior to the date of redemption, the Notes to be redeemed in part.  
    
  Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be required to: (i) issue, register the transfer of or exchange Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Notes to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of mailing the relevant notice of redemption; or (ii) register the transfer of or exchange any Note, or portion thereof, called for redemption, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.  
    
  (b)   Maturity; Payment of Principal and Interest  . The principal amount of the Notes shall be payable on October 1, 2026, subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. Interest will accrue from September 20, 2016. The Notes will bear interest at 3.250% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2017. Principal and interest payments on interests represented by a Global Note will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner of such Global Note. All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Global Note will be made by the Company in immediately available funds. The principal of the Notes payable on the Maturity Date or upon redemption will be paid against presentation and surrender of the Notes at the corporate trust office of the Trustee at 60 Livingston Avenue, 1   st    Floor, Bond Drop Window, St. Paul, MN, 55107, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public or private debt.  
    
  (c)   Applicability of Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance  . The provisions of Article 14 of the Base Indenture shall apply to the Notes.  

ARTICLE TWO 
  Remedies 
    
  The Notes shall be subject to all remedies contained in the Base Indenture, as supplemented by this Sixth Supplemental Indenture.  In addition, this Sixth Supplemental Indenture amends and restates Section 501(5) of the Base Indenture to read as follows: 
    
   (5) a default under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness of the Company, or under any mortgage, indenture or other instrument of the Company (including a default with respect to Securities of any series other than that series) under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured any indebtedness of the Company (or by any Subsidiary, the repayment of which the Company has guaranteed or for which the Company is directly responsible or liable as obligor or guarantor on a full recourse basis) whether such indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, which default shall constitute a failure to pay an aggregate principal amount exceeding $50,000,000 of such indebtedness when due and payable after the expiration of any applicable grace period with respect thereto and shall have resulted in such indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $50,000,000 becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, without such indebtedness having been discharged, or such acceleration having been rescinded or annulled, within a period of 10 days after there shall have been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee, or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, a written notice specifying such default and requiring the Company to cause such indebtedness to be discharged or cause such acceleration to be rescinded or annulled and stating that such notice is a  Notice of Default  hereunder; or  
    
  ARTICLE THREE 
  Additional Covenants    
    
  The Notes shall be governed by all the covenants contained in the Base Indenture, as supplemented by this Sixth Supplemental Indenture. In addition, this Sixth Supplemental Indenture amends and restates Section 1004 of the Base Indenture to read as follows:

  (b) The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, incur any Debt if the ratio of Consolidated Income Available for Debt Service to the Annual Service Charge on the date on which such additional Debt is to be incurred, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt and to the application of the proceeds thereof would have been less than 1.5 to 1.  
    
       (c) The Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, incur any Debt secured by any mortgage, lien, charge, pledge, encumbrance or security interest of any kind upon any of the properties of the Company or any Subsidiary ( Secured Debt ), whether owned at the date hereof or hereafter acquired, if, immediately after giving effect to the incurrence of such Secured Debt and the application of the proceeds thereof, the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Secured Debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis is greater than 40% of the sum of: (i) the Company s Adjusted Total Assets as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter prior to the incurrence of such additional Debt; and (ii) the increase in Adjusted Total Assets since the end of such quarter (including any increase resulting from the incurrence of additional Debt).     
    
  (d) The Company will at all times maintain an Unencumbered Total Asset Value in an amount not less than 150% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding unsecured Debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  
    
  For purposes of the foregoing provisions regarding the limitation on the incurrence of Debt, Debt shall be deemed to be  incurred  by the Company or a Subsidiary whenever the Company or such Subsidiary shall create, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable in respect thereof.  

ARTICLE FOUR

  SECTION 4.01   Trustee  . The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Sixth Supplemental Indenture or the due execution thereof by the Company.

  LIBERTY PROPERTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
  3.250% Senior Note due 2026 
  September 20, 2016 
  Liberty Property Limited Partnership, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (the  Issuer,  which term includes any successor under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede   Co. or its registered assigns, the principal sum of Four Hundred Million Dollars ($400,000,000) on October 1, 2026 (the  Maturity Date ), and to pay interest thereon from September 20, 2016 (or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for), semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1     of each year (each, an  Interest Payment Date ), commencing on April 1, 2017, and on the Maturity Date, at the rate of 3.250% per annum, until payment of said principal sum has been made or duly provided for. 
  The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date and on the Maturity Date will be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the  Record Date  for such payment, which will be the March 15 or September 15 (regardless of whether such day is a Business Day (as defined below)) preceding such Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. Any interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such record date, and shall be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a subsequent record date for the payment of such defaulted interest (which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the payment of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Issuer to the Holders of the Securities of this series not less than 10 days preceding such subsequent record date. Interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. 
  The principal of this Note payable on the Maturity Date or upon redemption will be paid against presentation and surrender of this Note at the corporate trust office of the Trustee at 60 Livingston Avenue, 1   st    Floor, Bond Drop Window, St. Paul, MN, 55107, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public or private debt. 
  Interest payable on this Note on any Interest Payment Date and on the Maturity Date, as the case may be, will be the amount of interest accrued from and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date (or from and including  

September 20, 2016, in the case of the initial Interest Payment Date) to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be. If any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), the required payment of interest or principal or both, as the case may be, will be made on the next Business Day with the same force and effect as if it were made on the date such payment was due and no interest will accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.

[REVERSE OF NOTE] 
  LIBERTY PROPERTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
  3.250% Senior Note due 2026 
  This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes, bonds, or other evidences of indebtedness of the Issuer (hereinafter called the  Securities ) of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of September 22, 2010 (herein called the  Indenture ), duly executed and delivered by the Issuer to U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (herein called the  Trustee,  which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture with respect to the series of Securities of which this Note is a part), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto relating to this security reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties, and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer, and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), and may otherwise vary as provided in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto.  This Security is one of a series designated as the 3.250% Notes due 2026 of the Issuer. 
  In case an Event of Default with respect to this Security shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof and Make Whole Amount, if any, may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect, and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. 
  The Issuer may redeem this Security at any time at the option of the Issuer, in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price (the  Redemption Price ) equal to the greater of (i) the principal amount of this Security being redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on this Security to be redeemed that would be due if such Security matured on the Par Call Date (as defined below) but for the redemption thereof (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Reinvestment Rate plus 25 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the Redemption Date; provided, however, that if the Redemption Date falls after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the Issuer will pay the full amount of accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, due on such Interest Payment Date to the Holder of record at the close of business on the corresponding Regular Record Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Security is redeemed on and after July 1, 2026 (the  Par Call Date ), the Redemption Price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Security being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date. Notice of any optional redemption of any Securities of this series will be given to Holders thereof at their addresses, as shown in the Security Register for the Securities of this series, not more than 60 nor less than 15 days prior to the date fixed for redemption.  The notice of redemption will specify, among other items, the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price and the principal amount of the Securities of this series held by such Holder to be redeemed. 
  The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of all Outstanding Securities affected, evidenced as provided in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) or any installment of interest on, any such Security, (ii) reduce the principal amount of, or the rate or amount of interest on, or any premium payable on redemption of the Notes, or adversely affect any right of repayment of the Holder of any Securities; (iii) change the place of payment, or the coin or currency, for payment of principal or premium, if any, or interest on the Securities; (iv) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the Securities on or after the stated maturity of any such Security; (v) reduce the above-stated percentage in principal amount of outstanding Securities, the consent of whose Holders is necessary to modify or amend the Indenture, for any waiver with respect to the Securities or to waive compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or certain defaults and consequences thereunder or to reduce the quorum or voting requirements set forth in the Indenture; or (vi) modify any of the foregoing provisions or any of the provisions relating to the waiver of certain past defaults or certain covenants, except to increase the required percentage to effect such action or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture may not be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Security. It is also provided in the Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in principal amount outstanding of the Securities of such series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences, or, subject to  

certain conditions, may rescind a declaration of acceleration and its consequences with respect to such Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and any Securities that may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this security or such other securities. 
  No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any interest on this Security in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed. 
  This Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.  Securities may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of other authorized denominations at the office or agency of the Issuer in The Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, but without the payment of any service charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith. 
  Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of Securities at the office or agency of the Issuer in The Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, one or more new Securities of the same series of authorized denominations in an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith. 
  Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner of this Security (whether or not this security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any authorized agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
  The Indenture and each Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 
  Capitalized terms used herein which are not otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto relating to this Security.
