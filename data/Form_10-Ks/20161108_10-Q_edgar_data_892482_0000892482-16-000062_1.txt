QUMU CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 

(1) 
    Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation 
     Qumu Corporation (the "Company") provides the tools businesses need to create, manage, secure, deliver and measure the success of their videos. The Company's innovative solutions release the power in video to engage and empower employees, partners and clients. Organizations around the world realize the greatest possible value from video they create and publish. Whatever the audience size, viewer device or network configuration, the Company's solutions are how business does video. 
  The Company views its operations and manages its business as   one   segment and one reporting unit. Factors used to identify the Company's single operating segment and reporting unit include the financial information available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions about how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company manages the marketing of its products and services through regional sales representatives and independent distributors in the United States and international markets. 
  The Company previously conducted its operations through two businesses consisting of 1) its enterprise video content management software business and 2) its disc publishing business. On June 27, 2014, the Company's shareholders approved the sale of the disc publishing assets and on July 1, 2014, the sale was completed. As a result, effective June 27, 2014, the disc publishing business was classified as held for sale and qualified for presentation as discontinued operations effective with the reporting of the Company's financial results for the second quarter of 2014. Accordingly, effective June 27, 2014, the Company had one remaining reportable segment, the enterprise video content management software business. The operational results of the disc publishing business are presented in the  Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax  line item on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. All remaining amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes reflect the financial results and financial position of the Company's continuing enterprise video content management software business, other than consolidated amounts reflecting operating results and balances for both the continuing and discontinued operations.  
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain financial information and footnote disclosures normally included in a complete set of financial statements have been condensed or omitted. However, in the opinion of management, the financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the interim periods presented. Operating results for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year, due to seasonal, operating and other factors. The operating results for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   reflect the Company's disc publishing business as discontinued operations. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
           (2) 
    Marketable Securities 
     Marketable securities consisted of the following (in thousands):

No   marketable securities were outstanding as of September 30, 2016. 
   
           (3) 
    Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
     Changes in the Company s amortizable intangible assets consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Changes to the carrying amount of net amortizable intangible assets for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Amortization expense of intangible assets consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Changes to the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   consisted of the following (in thousands): 

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company s stock price traded at levels which caused the Company s enterprise value, excluding any control premium, to approximate its book value, resulting in increased risk of a potential impairment of goodwill. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s market capitalization, without a control premium, exceeded its book value by approximately   9%  . Declines in the Company's market capitalization could require the Company to record goodwill and other impairment charges. While a goodwill impairment charge is a non-cash charge, it would have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations.

      Commitments and Contingencies 
     Leases and Other Financing Obligations 
  Balances for assets acquired under capital lease obligations and included in property and equipment were as follows (in thousands): 

The current and long-term portions of capital leases and other financing obligations were as follows (in thousands): 

The Company leases certain of its facilities and some of its equipment under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements. The rental payments under these leases are charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the lease. Future minimum payments under capital lease obligations, other financing obligations, and non-cancelable operating leases, excluding property taxes and other operating expenses, as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands): 

The above schedule excludes future payments associated with the term loan credit agreement the Company entered into on October 21, 2016, described in Note 10 "Subsequent Event." 
  Contingencies 
  The Company is exposed to a number of asserted and unasserted claims encountered in the normal course of business. Legal costs related to loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. In the opinion of management, the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.  
  The Company s standard arrangements include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities if the Company's products infringe a third-party s intellectual property rights. The Company has not incurred any costs in its continuing operations as a result of such indemnifications and has not accrued any liabilities related to such contingent obligations in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

    Stock-Based Compensation 
     The Company granted the following stock-based awards: 

With the exception of an award of non-qualified options to purchase   130,000   shares of the Company's common stock to a newly hired executive management level employee on May 18, 2015, the stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were granted under the Company's Second Amended and Restated 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"), a shareholder approved plan. 
  On May 12, 2016, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the 2007 Plan to increase the number of shares authorized under the plan by   500,000   to a total of   2,730,320   shares. 
  The Company recognized the following expense related to its share-based payment arrangements (in thousands): 

(6) 
    Income Taxes 
     As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled   $1.0 million   and   $970,000  , respectively (excluding interest and penalties). Total accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits amounted to   $3,000   and   $4,000   on a gross basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The change in the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits reflects an increase in reserves established for federal and state research and development credits. The Company does not currently expect significant changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. 
   
           (7) 
      Computation of Net Loss From Continuing Operations Per Share of Common Stock 
     The following table identifies the components of net loss per basic and diluted share (in thousands, except for per share data):

     Table of Contents  

Stock options and restricted stock units to acquire weighted average common shares excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average common shares as their effect is anti-dilutive were as follows (in thousands): 

Restricted stock units to acquire   120,000   common shares were outstanding as of September 30, 2016. 
  As described in Note 10 "Subsequent Event," on October 21, 2016, the Company issued a warrant for the purchase of   314,286   shares of the Company's common stock having an exercise price of   $2.80   per share.  
   
           (8) 
      Investment in Software Company 
     At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company held an investment totaling   $3.1 million   in convertible preferred stock of BriefCam, Ltd. ( BriefCam ), a privately-held Israeli company that develops video synopsis technology to augment security and surveillance systems to facilitate review of surveillance video. The investment is included in other non-current assets. Because the Company's ownership interest is less than   20%   and it has no other rights or privileges that enable it to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of BriefCam, the Company accounts for this equity investment using the cost method. Equity securities accounted for under the cost method are reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events that suggest the Company s investment may not be fully recoverable. If an unrealized loss for the investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the loss will be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period the determination is made. The Company monitors BriefCam's results of operations, business plan and capital raising activities and is not aware of any events or circumstances that would indicate a decline in the carrying value of its investment. 
   
           (9) 
     Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which will simplify the income tax consequences, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases,   which will supersede the existing lease guidance and will require all leases with a term greater than 12 months to be recognized in the statements of financial position and eliminate current real estate-specific lease guidance, while maintaining substantially similar classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements of adopting this standard, which will require right-of-use assets and lease liabilities be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for operating leases. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB voted to amend ASU 2014-09 by approving a one-year deferral of the effective date as well as providing the option to early adopt the standard on the original effective date. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 but may be early adopted effective January 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
   
   As disclosed on the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 21, 2016, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ), under which it borrowed   $8 million   as a term loan on October 21, 2016. The term loan is scheduled to mature on October 21, 2019 and requires payment of interest monthly at the prime rate plus   6%  . The Company may prepay the term loan at any time with the payment of the applicable pre-payment fee, or may be obligated to prepay the term loan, with the payment of the applicable pre-payment fee, with the net proceeds from certain dispositions

     Table of Contents  

(other than the Company s interest in BriefCam, Ltd.), issuances of equity or debt securities, extraordinary transactions and upon a change of control. 
  The Company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the Credit Agreement, including various financial covenants relating to a maximum cumulative net cash operating amount, minimum eligible accounts receivable and cash, minimum cash, minimum core bookings, maximum deferred revenue non-current, minimum subscription, maintenance and support revenue, and renewal rates.  
  In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company granted a first priority security interest in substantially all of its properties, rights and assets and Qumu, Inc. provided a guaranty of the Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement pursuant to a Guaranty and Collateral Agreement dated October 21, 2016 in favor of the administrative agent.  
  In connection with the Credit Agreement, on October 21, 2016, the Company issued a warrant to purchase   314,286   shares of the Company s common stock. The warrant has an exercise price of   $2.80   per share and an expiration date of October 21, 2026, and is transferrable. Upon the occurrence of certain defined events, the warrant holder has the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of the warrant, an amount of securities, cash or property as if the warrant holder had been a holder of the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant, or the warrant holder may require the Company to purchase the warrant from the holder for a cash amount equal to the greater of the original issuance value of   $915,390   and the Black-Scholes value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant.  
  The terms of the warrant require liability classification upon issuance on October 21, 2016. This liability will be remeasured to its fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting date. The change in fair value of the warrant liability during each reporting period will be recorded on our consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense), net, at each reporting date. Management's judgment is used to estimate the fair value of the warrant, which is classified as a Level 3 liability under the fair value hierarchy. Generally, increases (decreases) in the fair value of the underlying stock and estimated term would have a directionally similar impact to the fair value measurement. 
   
  Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the section titled  Financial Information  and our audited financial statements and related notes which are included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in  Risk Factors  included our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  Overview 
  Qumu Corporation ("Qumu" or the "Company") provides the tools businesses need to create, manage, secure, deliver and measure the success of their videos. The Company's innovative solutions release the power in video to engage and empower employees, partners and clients. Organizations around the world realize the greatest possible value from video they create and publish. Whatever the audience size, viewer device or network configuration, the Company's solutions are how business does video. 
  The Company generates revenue through the sale of enterprise video content management software solutions, hardware, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. Software sales may take the form of a perpetual software license, a term software license or a cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS). Software licenses and appliances revenue includes sales of perpetual software licenses and hardware. Service revenue includes term software licenses, SaaS, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company generated revenues of   $22.4 million   and   $24.3 million  , respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company generated revenues of $34.5 million, $26.5 million and $17.7 million, respectively. The Company reduced its expense structure over the past twelve months as it transitions to more recurring revenue and a lower reliance on perpetual license sales over time.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The discussion of the Company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions. Management bases its estimates of the carrying value of certain assets  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. The Company's actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  Management utilizes its technical knowledge, cumulative business experience, judgment and other factors in the selection and application of the Company s accounting policies. The accounting policies considered by management to be the most critical to the presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements because they require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments include revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, investment in nonconsolidated company, stock-based compensation, royalties for third party technology, and deferred tax asset valuation allowances. These accounting policies are discussed in Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
  Management made no significant changes to the Company s critical accounting policies during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Results of Operations 
  The percentage relationships to revenues of certain income and expense items for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the percentage changes in these income and expense items relative to prior year periods, are contained in the following table:

     Table of Contents  

Revenues 
  The Company generates revenue through the sale of enterprise video content management software solutions, appliances, maintenance and support, and professional and other services. Software sales may take the form of a perpetual software license, a term software license or a cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS). Software licenses and appliances revenue includes sales of perpetual software licenses and hardware. Service revenue includes term software licenses, SaaS, maintenance and support, and professional and other services.  
  The table below describes Qumu's revenues by product category (dollars in thousands): 

Revenues can vary period to period based on the type and size of contract the Company enters into with each customer. Contracts for perpetual software licenses, which are included in software licenses and appliances revenues, generally result in revenue recognized closer to the contract commitment date, while contracts for term software licenses and SaaS, which are included in service revenues, result in most of the revenue being recognized over the period of the contract.  
  The decreases in software licenses and appliances revenues in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding   2015   periods were driven by decreases in perpetual software license and appliance sales.  
  The increase in subscription, maintenance and support revenues in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding   2015   period was driven by the timing of customer renewals, whereby the recognition of revenue in some cases was delayed until renewal contracts were finalized. The increase in subscription, maintenance and support revenues in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding   2015   period was primary due to the inclusion of approximately $700,000 of revenue in the first quarter 2016 relating to customer acceptance and contract buyouts, the runoff of approximately $505,000 of the deferred revenue write-down during 2015 relating to the Kulu Valley acquisition, and the balance of the increase was a result of the net impact of customer activity.  
  The decreases in professional services revenues in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding   2015   periods were driven by the impact of decreased perpetual software license and appliance sales and the timing of delivery of professional services.  
  Future consolidated revenues will be dependent upon many factors, including the rate of adoption of the Company's software solutions in its targeted markets and whether arrangements with customers are structured as a perpetual software license, a term software license or a SaaS, which impacts the timing of revenue recognition. Other factors that will influence future consolidated revenues include the timing of customer orders, the impact of changes in economic conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit 
  A comparison of gross profit and gross margin by revenue category is as follows (dollars in thousands): 

The improvements in total gross margin of   10.5%   and   10.9%   in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to the corresponding 2015 periods, were driven by the improvement in service gross margin related to cost savings initiatives implemented beginning in the second half of 2015 with continued declines in service headcount during 2016 and, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , improved economies of scale on increased subscription, maintenance and support revenues. Partially offsetting the improvement in service gross margins were decreases in software license and appliances gross margins in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the corresponding   2015   periods, due primarily to the product mix for the   2016   periods which included a higher percentage of appliance sales, which generally have lower margins than software license revenue. The Company had   28   and   44   service personnel at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Gross margins include   $308,000   and   $320,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $953,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , for the amortization of intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisition of Qumu, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2011 and Kulu Valley in the fourth quarter of 2014. Cost of revenues in 2016 are expected to include approximately $1.3 million of amortization expense for purchased intangibles. 
  Future gross profit margins will fluctuate quarter to quarter and will be impacted by the rate of growth and mix of the Company's product and service offerings and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Research and development 
  Research and development expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Total research and development expenses as a percent of revenues were   28%   and   30%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   30%   and   35%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decreases in expenses in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding   2015   periods were driven primarily by decreased outside services and consulting expense due to cost savings initiatives implemented in the second half of 2015 and decreased compensation and employee-related expenses in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and severance costs incurred during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The Company had   63   and   60   research and development personnel at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Sales and marketing 
  Sales and marketing expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Total sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenues were   34%   and   49%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   40%   and   59%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decreases in expenses in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding   2015   periods were primarily due to lower headcount, compensation, and travel expenses in addition to lower severance expense. The Company had   36   and   63   sales and marketing personnel at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

General and administrative 
  General and administrative expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands): 

Total general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were   30%   and   45%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   33%   and   50%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decreases in expenses in the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding   2015   periods were driven primarily by an equipment operating lease loss of $1 million during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   relating to equipment that the Company no longer planned to utilize as part of its managed services offerings. Also contributing to the decrease were cost reduction activities and executive transition initiatives implemented in   2015  , as well as lower recruiting fees, headcount, and in the nine months ended September 2016, lower long-term incentive expense. The Company had   25   and   27   general and administrative personnel at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Amortization of Purchased Intangibles 
  Operating expenses include   $221,000   and   $200,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $674,000   and   $599,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the Company s acquisition of Qumu, Inc. in October 2011 and Kulu Valley in October 2014. Operating expenses in   2016   are expected to include approximately $0.9 million of amortization expense associated with purchased intangibles, exclusive of the portion classified in cost of revenue. 
  Other Income (Expense), Net 
  The Company recognized interest expense of   $13,000   and   $10,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and interest expense of   $40,000   and interest income of   $21,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Other expense, net, included net losses on foreign currency transactions of   $2,000   and   $89,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $13,000   and   $157,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. See  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below for a discussion of changes in cash levels. 
  Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes represents federal, state, and foreign income taxes or income tax benefit on income or loss. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net income tax benefit amounted to   $39,000   and   $163,000  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net income tax benefit amounted to   $133,000   and   $482,000  , respectively. The income tax benefit for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is primarily attributable to United Kingdom operations, which include refundable research credits. 
  Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 
  The Company closed the sale of its disc publishing business effective July 1, 2014. Net income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was   $79,000   and net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was   $10,000   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. Discontinued operations results include non-recurring expenses incurred by the Company as a result of the sale of the disc publishing business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Company's liquidity and capital resources (in thousands): 

As described in Note 10 "Subsequent Event" in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, on October 21, 2016, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement, under which it borrowed $8 million as a term loan. The term loan is scheduled to mature on October 21, 2019 and requires payment of interest monthly at the prime rate plus 6%. The term loan strengthened the Company's balance sheet and the funds will enable the Company to advance its market leadership as it continues to provide the best enterprise video content management solutions and services to its customers and the Global 5000 market while it transitions to more recurring revenue over time. 
  Due to the timing of expected sales in the fourth quarter 2016 and collection of the related receivables, much of which will occur in the in first quarter 2017, the Company anticipates that, excluding the net proceeds of the $8.0 million term loan obtained in October 2016, it will not be cash flow breakeven the fourth quarter 2016 as previously anticipated. Whether or not the Company achieves its cash flow goal in the fourth quarter 2016, the Company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents, along with the $8.0 million term loan obtained in October 2016 and expected future cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet the Company s expected working capital requirements for the next 12 months. Potential strategies for raising additional capital could include, but are not be limited to, the sale of all or a portion of the Company s BriefCam investment. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had aggregate working capital of   $(1.9) million  , compared to working capital of   $(553,000)   and   $9.5 million   at June 30, 2016 and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Working capital was reduced by current deferred revenue of   $10.0 million  ,   $10.1 million   and   $10.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , June 30, 2016 and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The primary contributor to the change in working capital was the decreased sales volume over the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , which negatively impacted cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.  
  The Company's primary source of cash from operating activities has been cash collections from sales of products and services to customers. The Company expects cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases or decreases in sales and timing of collections. The Company's primary use of cash for operating activities has been for personnel costs, payment of royalties associated with third-party software licenses and purchases of equipment to fulfill customer orders. The Company expects cash flows from operating activities to be affected by fluctuations in revenues, personnel costs and the amount and timing of royalty payments and equipment purchases as the Company continues to support the growth of the business. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's international subsidiaries that is not available to fund domestic operations unless repatriated was $2.1 million as of   September 30, 2016  . The repatriation of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's international subsidiaries would not result in an adverse tax impact on cash due to the Company's net operating loss position with respect to income taxes. 
  Summary of Cash Flows.   A summary of cash flows is as follows (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

Operating activities 
  Net cash used in operating activities was   $8.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $21.7 million   for corresponding   2015   period. The change in operating cash flows for the   2016   period as compared to the   2015   period was favorably impacted by changes in receivables, accrued compensation and income tax receivable, as well as a lower net loss in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The change in operating cash flows for the   2016   period as compared to the   2015   period was unfavorably impacted by the change in deferred revenue balances, which decreased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and increased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , driven by the timing of sales and maintenance renewals, and the timing of delivery of products and services as impacted by the appropriate revenue recognition criteria. Additionally, the change in cash used in operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   2015   period was impacted by a   $715,000   favorable change in cash from discontinued operations in connection with the Company's sale of its discontinued disc publishing business effective July 1, 2014.  
  Investing activities 
  Net cash provided by investing activities totaled, in the aggregate,   $6.2 million   for   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $14.2 million   in the corresponding   2015   period. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 primarily resulted from maturities of marketable securities of   $6.3 million  . The   $14.2 million   cash provided by investing activities in   2015   resulted from maturities of marketable securities, net of related purchases, of   $14.7 million  , partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of   $530,000  . 
  Financing activities 
  Financing activities used net cash of   $404,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   $145,000   in the comparable period in   2015  . Primarily impacting the current period use of cash were principal payments on capital leases and other financing obligations of   $386,000  . 
  Since October 2010, the Company s Board of Directors has approved common stock repurchases of up to   3,500,000   shares. Shares may be purchased at prevailing market prices in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market conditions, share price, trading volume and other factors. The repurchase program has been funded to date using cash on hand and may be discontinued at any time. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock under the repurchase program during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   778,365   shares available for repurchase under the authorizations. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is prohibited from repurchasing or redeeming its stock, subject to certain exceptions for relating to the exercise or vesting of equity awards. 
  The Company did not declare or pay any dividends during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends.

  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Foreign Currency Translation.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is exposed to market risk primarily from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen and Singapore Dollar to the U.S. Dollar as the financial position and operating results of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders  equity. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). The Company's management has evaluated, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,   2015   and described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015   were not effectively remediated as of   September 30, 2016   due to the fact that an insufficient period of time has passed for management to test its implemented remediation plan. Accordingly, based upon their evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Through the Company's on-going remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015   and summarized below, there have been changes to the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  
  Based on our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over (i) financial reporting related to the Company s risk assessment and monitoring processes, (ii) manual journal entries, (iii) account reconciliations and (iv) revenue review. 
  In order to remediate the material weakness related to internal control over financial reporting relating to the Company s risk assessment and monitoring processes, during the first half of 2016 we reviewed our existing processes and engaged a third-party consulting firm that assisted us with implementing process-level controls and monitoring activities that are responsive to

     Table of Contents  

changes in the business and personnel and are aligned with our financial reporting objectives. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2016, we completed the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system and implemented new controls, and enhanced existing controls, that address the completeness and accuracy of underlying data included in system-generated reports. With respect to our monitoring activities, we implemented processes, including a sub-certification process, that assist us in the timely identification, evaluation, communication and remediation of internal control deficiencies.  
  With respect to the material weaknesses over manual journal entries, account reconciliations and revenue review, action was taken by management to enhance the design of existing controls and implement additional controls. The implementation of our new ERP system in 2016 enabled us to obtain a complete population of manual journal entries and enhanced the process for the appropriate review and approval of those entries. Regarding account reconciliations, we implemented procedures to monitor their timely completion and review. The implementation of our new ERP system assisted us in addressing the material weakness over revenue review by providing system-generated reports that are now validated for completeness and accuracy. Additionally, we enhanced our processes over the documentation and review of revenue entries recorded to the general ledger, including the evaluation of the completeness and accuracy of underlying data. 
  A substantial portion of the Company's remediation was completed in conjunction with the third quarter 2016 financial close and financial reporting cycle, with final testing of the effectiveness of the Company's controls scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2016 or in conjunction its fiscal 2016 financial reporting cycle.
