  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  References to  Brinker,  the "Company,   we,   us  and  our  in this Form 10-Q are references to Brinker International, Inc. and its subsidiaries and any predecessor companies of Brinker International, Inc. 
  Our consolidated financial statements as of   September 28, 2016   and   June 29, 2016   and for the   thirteen week   periods ended   September 28, 2016   and   September 23, 2015   have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). We are principally engaged in the ownership, operation, development, and franchising of the Chili s        Grill   Bar ( Chili s ) and Maggiano s Little Italy        ( Maggiano s ) restaurant brands. At   September 28, 2016  , we owned, operated or franchised   1,652   restaurants in the United States and   30   countries and   two   territories outside of the United States. 
  The foreign currency translation adjustment included in comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income represents the unrealized impact of translating the financial statements of our Canadian restaurants and our Mexican joint venture from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars. This amount is not included in net income and would only be realized upon disposition of the businesses. The accumulated other comprehensive loss is presented on the consolidated balance sheets. We reinvest foreign earnings, therefore, United States deferred income taxes have not been provided on foreign earnings.  
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  This update requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, which required us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  Accordingly, we reclassified the debt issuance cost balances associated with the 2.60% notes and 3.88% notes of   $1.0 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively, from other assets to long-term debt, less current installments on the consolidated balance sheet as of June 29, 2016. The reclassification did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. This update provides guidance to companies that purchase cloud computing services to determine whether or not the arrangement includes a software license and the related accounting treatment. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, which required us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We adopted the guidance prospectively and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) which are, in our opinion, necessary to fairly state the interim operating results, financial position and cash flows for the respective periods. However, these operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. The notes to the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the   June 29, 2016   Form 10-K. We believe the disclosures are sufficient for interim financial reporting purposes. 

2.  ACQUISITION OF CHILI'S RESTAURANTS 
    
  On   June 25, 2015  , we completed the stock acquisition of   Pepper Dining Holding Corp. ("Pepper Dining")  , a franchisee of   103   Chili's Grill   Bar restaurants primarily located in the Northeast and Southeast United States.  The purchase price of   $106.5 million  , excluding cash and customary working capital adjustments of   $0.9 million  , was funded with borrowings from our existing credit facility.  The results of operations of these restaurants are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.  The assets and liabilities of the restaurants were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition.

     Table of Contents  

The acquisition of Pepper Dining resulted in the recognition of   $31.9 million   of goodwill and we expect   $12.8 million   of the goodwill balance to be deductible for tax purposes.  The portion of the purchase price attributable to goodwill represents the benefits expected as a result of the acquisition, including sales and unit growth opportunities.  
   
  3. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting periods. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. For the calculation of diluted net income per share, the basic weighted average number of shares is increased by the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted share awards determined using the treasury stock method.  Stock options and restricted share awards with an anti-dilutive effect are not included in the diluted net income per share calculation. 
  Basic weighted average shares outstanding is reconciled to diluted weighted average shares outstanding as follows (in thousands): 

4. LONG-TERM DEBT 
  Long-term debt consists of the following (in thousands): 

During the first two months of fiscal   2017  ,   $70.0 million   was drawn from the $750 million revolving credit facility primarily to fund share repurchases for which we repaid a total of   $20.0 million  . On September 13, 2016, we amended the revolving credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity from   $750 million   to   $1 billion  . We capitalized debt issuance costs of   $4.0 million   associated with the amendment of the revolving credit facility which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2016.  Subsequent to the amendment, we repaid an additional   $13.0 million  . 
  On September 23, 2016, we completed the private offering of $350 million of our   5.0%   senior notes due   October 2024  .  We received proceeds of   $350.0 million   prior to debt issuance costs of   $5.9 million   and utilized the proceeds to fund a $300 million accelerated share repurchase agreement and to repay   $50 million   on the amended $1 billion revolving credit facility.  See Note 8 for additional disclosures related to the accelerated share repurchase agreement. The notes require semi-annual interest payments beginning on April 1, 2017.

     Table of Contents  

Under the amended $1 billion revolving credit facility, the maturity date for $890.0 million of the facility is extended from March 12, 2020 to   September 12, 2021   and the remaining $110.0 million remains due on   March 12, 2020  . The amended  revolving credit facility bears interest of LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which is a function of our credit rating and debt to cash flow ratio, but is subject to a maximum of LIBOR plus   2.00%  . Based on our current credit rating, we are paying interest at a rate of LIBOR plus   1.38%   for a total of   1.90%  .   One month LIBOR   at   September 28, 2016   was approximately   0.52%  . As of   September 28, 2016  ,   $482.8 million   of credit is available under the revolving credit facility. 
   Our debt agreements contain various financial covenants that, among other things, require the maintenance of certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The financial covenants were not significantly changed as a result of the new and amended debt agreements.   We are currently in compliance with all financial covenants.    

5.  OTHER GAINS AND CHARGES 
    
  Other gains and charges consist of the following (in thousands): 

Fiscal 2017 
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded restaurant closure charges of   $2.5 million   primarily related to lease termination charges for restaurants closed during the quarter.  Additionally, we incurred   $2.5 million   of professional fees and severance associated with the information technology restructuring. 
  Fiscal 2016 
  During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we incurred   $2.2 million   in severance and other benefits related to organizational changes.  Additionally, we recorded a   $1.8 million   gain on the sale of property. 

6.  ACCRUED AND OTHER LIABILITIES 
  Other accrued liabilities consist of the following (in thousands):

Other liabilities consist of the following (in thousands): 

7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In determining fair value, the accounting standards establish a three level hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, as follows: 
             
    Level 1   inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2   inputs are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 3   inputs are unobservable and reflect our own assumptions. 
       
           (a) 
    Non-Financial Assets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis 
       
  We review the carrying amounts of property and equipment, reacquired franchise rights and transferable liquor licenses semi-annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the fair value may not exceed the carrying amount. We record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. No impairment charges were recorded in the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. 
    
  We review the carrying amount of goodwill annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the fair value may not exceed the carrying amount. We record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.  No impairment charges were recorded in the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 and no indicators of impairment were identified through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017.   
    
           (b) 
    Other Financial Instruments 
     Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts because of the short maturity of these items. The carrying amount of debt outstanding related to the amended revolving credit facility approximates fair value as the interest rate on this instrument approximates current market rates (Level 2). The fair values of the   2.60%   notes,   3.88%   notes and   5.00%   notes are based on quoted market prices and are considered Level 2 fair value measurements. 
  The carrying amounts, which are net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and fair values of the 2.60% notes, 3.88% notes and 5.00% notes are as follows (in thousands):

8. SHAREHOLDERS  DEFICIT 
  In August 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a   $150.0 million   increase to our existing share repurchase program resulting in total authorizations of   $4.3 billion  .  In September 2016, we entered into a $300.0 million accelerated share repurchase agreement ("ASR Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. ( BofA ).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, we paid BofA   $300.0 million   in cash, and on   September 26, 2016  , we received an initial delivery of approximately   4.6 million   shares of common stock. Additional shares may be received prior to and/or at final settlement, based generally on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the Company s common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount.  Final settlement of the ASR Agreement will occur no later than March 31, 2017, although the settlement may be accelerated at BofA s option. We also repurchased approximately   1.0 million   additional shares of common stock for a total of   5.6 million   shares repurchased during the   first quarter   of fiscal   2017   for   $350.0 million  .  The repurchased shares included shares purchased as part of our share repurchase program and shares repurchased to satisfy team member tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted shares.  As of   September 28, 2016  , approximately   $135.8 million   was available under our share repurchase authorizations. Our stock repurchase plan has been and will be used to return capital to shareholders and to minimize the dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards. We evaluate potential share repurchases under our plan based on several factors, including our cash position, share price, operational liquidity, proceeds from divestitures, borrowings, and planned investment and financing needs. The accelerated share repurchase transaction qualifies for equity accounting treatment.  Shares that have been paid for but not yet delivered are reflected as a reduction of additional paid-in capital while other repurchased common stock is reflected as an increase in treasury stock within shareholders  deficit.  
  During the   first quarter   of fiscal   2017  , we granted approximately   481,000   stock options with a weighted average exercise price per share of   $54.33   and a weighted average fair value per share of   $9.65  , and approximately   214,000   restricted share awards with a weighted average fair value per share of   $54.33  .  Additionally, during the   first quarter   of fiscal   2017  , approximately   127,000   stock options were exercised resulting in cash proceeds of approximately   $3.4 million  .  We received an excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation of approximately   $1.0 million  , net of a   $0.5 million   tax deficiency, during the   first quarter   primarily as a result of the vesting and distribution of restricted stock grants and performance shares and stock option exercises. The excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation represents the additional income tax benefit received resulting from the increase in the fair value of awards from the time of grant to the exercise date. 
  During the   first quarter   of fiscal   2017  , we paid dividends of   $18.3 million   to common stock shareholders, compared to   $18.1 million   in the prior year. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a   6.25%   increase in the quarterly dividend from   $0.32   to   $0.34   per share effective with the dividend declared in August 2016 of   $18.6 million   which was paid on   September 29, 2016  . The dividend accrual was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of   September 28, 2016  . 

9. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION 
  Cash paid for income taxes and interest in the   first quarter   of fiscal   2017   and   2016   are as follows (in thousands): 

Non-cash investing and financing activities for the   first quarter   of fiscal   2017   and   2016   are as follows (in thousands): 

10. CONTINGENCIES 
  In connection with the sale of restaurants to franchisees and brand divestitures, we have, in certain cases, guaranteed lease payments. As of   September 28, 2016   and   June 29, 2016  , we have outstanding lease guarantees or are secondarily liable for   $79.9 million   and   $72.9 million  , respectively. These amounts represent the maximum potential liability of future payments under  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

the guarantees. These leases have been assigned to the buyers and expire at the end of the respective lease terms, which range from fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2027. In the event of default, the indemnity and default clauses in our assignment agreements govern our ability to pursue and recover damages incurred.   No material liabilities have been recorded   as of   September 28, 2016  .  
  We provide letters of credit to various insurers to collateralize obligations for outstanding claims.  As of   September 28, 2016  , we had   $28.1 million   in undrawn standby letters of credit outstanding.  All standby letters of credit are renewable annually.  
  Evaluating contingencies related to litigation is a complex process involving subjective judgment on the potential outcome of future events, and the ultimate resolution of litigated claims may differ from our current analysis.  Accordingly, we review the adequacy of accruals and disclosures pertaining to litigated matters each quarter in consultation with legal counsel, and we assess the probability and range of possible losses associated with contingencies for potential accrual in the consolidated financial statements. 
  We are engaged in various legal proceedings and have certain unresolved claims pending.  Reserves have been established based on our best estimates of our potential liability in certain of these matters.  Based upon consultation with legal counsel, management is of the opinion that there are   no   matters pending or threatened which are expected to have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.   
   
  11. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
    
    Our operating segments are Chili's and Maggiano's. The Chili s segment includes the results of our company-owned Chili s restaurants in the U.S. and Canada as well as the results from our domestic and international franchise business. The Maggiano s segment includes the results of our company-owned Maggiano s restaurants.  
    
  Company sales are derived principally from the sales of food and beverages. Franchise and other revenues primarily includes royalties, development fees, franchise fees, banquet service charge income, gift card breakage and discounts, tabletop device revenue, Chili's retail food product royalties and delivery fee income. We do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales, and the customers and long-lived assets of our operating segments are predominantly in the U.S. There were no material transactions amongst our operating segments.  
    
  Our chief operating decision maker uses operating income as the measure for assessing performance of our segments. Operating income includes revenues and expenses directly attributable to segment-level results of operations. Operational expenses include food and beverage costs, restaurant labor costs and restaurant expenses. The following tables reconcile our segment results to our consolidated results reported in accordance with GAAP (in thousands):

12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
  Subsequent to the end of the quarter, and pursuant to the ASR Agreement, we received   483,423   shares of our common stock from BofA on the   October 31, 2016   scheduled interim delivery date.  

13.  EFFECT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230).  This update provides clarification regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The update will be applied on a retrospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718).  This update was issued as part of the FASB s simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the  
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. This update will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a cumulative effect transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. We have not yet determined the effect of this update on our ongoing financial reporting.     
    
    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  This update requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a corresponding right-of-use asset. The update also requires additional disclosures about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. This update will be applied on a modified retrospective basis. We have not yet determined the effect of this update on our ongoing financial reporting.     
    
    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The FASB has subsequently amended this update by issuing additional ASU's that provide clarification and further guidance around areas identified as potential implementation issues.  These updates provide a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. These updates also require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 delaying the effective date of adoption.  These updates are now effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early application in fiscal 2018 is permitted. These updates permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We do not believe the standard will impact our recognition of revenue from company-owned restaurants or our recognition of royalty fees from franchisees. We are continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions.

GENERAL 
  The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is intended to help the reader understand Brinker International, Inc., our operations, and our current operating environment. For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the quarters ended   September 28, 2016   and   September 23, 2015  , the MD A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this quarterly report. 

OVERVIEW 
  We are principally engaged in the ownership, operation, development, and franchising of the Chili s Grill   Bar ( Chili s ) and Maggiano s Little Italy ( Maggiano s ) restaurant brands. At   September 28, 2016  , we owned, operated, or franchised   1,652   restaurants. 
  We are committed to strategies and initiatives that are centered on long-term sales and profit growth, enhancing the guest experience and team member engagement. These strategies are intended to differentiate our brands from the competition, reduce the costs associated with managing our restaurants and establish a strong presence for our brands in key markets around the world. 
  Growing sales and traffic continues to be a challenge with increasing competition and heavy discounting in the casual dining industry along with recent economic pressures resulting from low oil prices and increasing health care costs.  U.S. economic growth has been steady in recent years, but wage growth in the higher paying sectors has been slow. This wage pressure has challenged both casual dining restaurant operators and consumers as discretionary income available for restaurant visits has been limited.  In response to these economic factors, we have developed both short and long-term strategies that we believe are appropriate for all operating conditions and will provide a solid foundation for future earnings growth. 
  We have completed a number of significant initiatives in recent years which we believe will help us drive profitable sales and traffic growth and improve the guest experience in our restaurants.  Investments in restaurant reimages, new kitchen equipment and operations software have improved the relevance of our brands and the efficiency of our restaurants.  We believe that these initiatives have positively impacted the guest perception of our restaurants in both the dining room and bar areas and provide us with a foundation for continued success.   We plan to build on this foundation with new initiatives designed to further leverage technology in a manner that we believe will enhance the guest experience and drive sales.  
  The Chili s brand has leveraged technology initiatives to create a digital guest experience that we believe will help us engage our guests more effectively.  All domestic Chili s restaurants with the exception of airport and college locations are now outfitted with tabletop devices, which gives us one of the largest networks of tabletop devices in the country. The Ziosk branded tabletop device is a multi-functional device which provides ordering, guest survey and pay-at-the-table capabilities, as well as loyalty program and entertainment functionality. We also plan to leverage our tabletop devices to enable our partnership with Plenti, a consumer rewards program comprised of a coalition of major national brands.  We believe the integration of the My Chili s Rewards program with Plenti will allow us to drive sales and profits by allowing us to create more relevant and customized incentives for our guests.  We are also investing in a new online ordering system that expands our current capabilities and gives our guests greater control of their experience.  We plan to launch the Plenti and online ordering platforms in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Our Nowait application allows our hosts to provide more accurate wait times when a guest arrives and provides a text message to guests when their table is ready.  Guests can also add themselves to the wait list via the Chili s mobile app.  This technology allows us to better control the optimization of our seating capacity and to reduce wait times in our restaurants.   
  We continually evaluate our menu at Chili's to identify opportunities to improve quality, freshness and value by introducing new items and improving existing favorites. Our Fresh Mex platform has been successful and includes Fresh Mex bowls, mix and match fajitas,  tableside guacamole and Top-Shelf Tacos. Our Texas themed Fresh Tex platform features ribs, steaks and burgers, and our traditional burger menu now features craft burgers with fresh potato buns and house made garlic pickles.  
  We refreshed our value proposition to drive sales and traffic in the first quarter with our new "3 for Me " limited time offer for a classic burger, salad and mini molten dessert for just $10.00. We are also promoting happy hour offerings with margaritas and will fully launch our new line of craft beers featuring regional and national favorites in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  We continually seek opportunities to reinforce value and create interest for the Chili's brand with new and varied offerings to further enhance sales and drive incremental traffic. We are committed to offering a compelling everyday menu that provides items our guests prefer at a solid value. 
  We expect that improvements at Chili's will have the most significant impact on the business; however, our results will also benefit through additional contributions from Maggiano's and our global business. Maggiano's opened one restaurant this quarter, a new prototype with a flexible dining area that may be used for banquets or opened up for general seating. This new  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

prototype allows the brand to enter new markets for which the prior model was not suited, but still accommodate smaller banquets. Maggiano's is committed to delivering high quality food and a dining experience in line with this brand's heritage. We plan to continue to strengthen this brand s business model with kitchen efficiency and inventory controls that we believe will continue to enhance profitability.  
  Our global Chili's business continues to grow with locations in 30 countries and two territories outside of the United States.  Our international franchisees opened 4 new restaurants this quarter with plans to open 35-40 new restaurants this year. 
   
  REVENUES 
  Total revenues for the   first quarter   of fiscal   2017   decreased to   $758.5 million  , a 0.5% decrease from the   $762.6 million   generated for the same quarter of fiscal   2016   driven by a 0.4% decrease in company sales.  The decrease in company sales for the first quarter was driven by a decline in comparable restaurant sales, partially offset by an increase in restaurant capacity (see table below). 

(1) 
    Comparable restaurant sales includes all restaurants that have been in operation for more than 18 months. 
              (2) 
    Mix shift is calculated as the year-over-year percentage change in company sales resulting from the change in menu items ordered by guests. 
              (3) 
    Revenues generated by franchisees are not included in revenues on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income; however, we generate royalty revenue and advertising fees based on franchise sales, where applicable. We believe including franchise comparable restaurant sales provides investors information regarding brand performance that is relevant to current operations and may impact future restaurant development. 
              (4) 
    Domestic comparable restaurant sales percentages are derived from sales generated by company-owned and franchise operated Chili's restaurants in the United States. 
              (5) 
    System-wide comparable restaurant sales are derived from sales generated by company-owned Chili s and Maggiano s restaurants in addition to the sales generated at franchise operated restaurants. 
              (6) 
    Reclassifications have been made between pricing impact, mix-shift and traffic in the prior year to conform with current year classification. 
     Chili s company sales decreased 0.7% to $648.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $653.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in comparable restaurant sales, partially offset by an increase in restaurant capacity. Chili's comparable restaurant sales decreased 1.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Company-owned  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

restaurant capacity increased 0.6% for the first quarter (as measured by sales weeks) compared to the prior year period due to three net restaurant openings since the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  
  Maggiano s company sales increased 1.5% to $88.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $87.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily driven by increased restaurant capacity, partially offset by a decline in comparable restaurant sales. Maggiano's capacity increased 3.0% (as measured by sales weeks) compared to the prior year period due to two net restaurant openings since the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  Comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
  Franchise and other revenues decreased 4.5% to   $21.1 million   in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to   $22.1 million   in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Our franchisees generated approximately $331 million in sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  
   
  COSTS AND EXPENSES 
  Cost of sales, as a percent of company sales, decreased to 26.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 26.6% for the prior year period. Cost of sales, as a percent of company sales, was positively impacted by increased menu pricing and favorable commodity pricing related to poultry and burger meat, partially offset by unfavorable menu item mix and commodity pricing primarily related to avocados.  
  Restaurant labor, as a percent of company sales, increased to 34.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 33.3% for the prior year period primarily due to increased wage rates. 
  Restaurant expenses, as a percent of company sales, increased to 26.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 25.5% for the prior year period primarily due to higher advertising and repairs and maintenance expenses, partially offset by lower workers' compensation insurance expenses. 
  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to an increase in fully depreciated assets and restaurant closures, partially offset by depreciation on asset replacements and new restaurant openings. 
  General and administrative expense decreased approximately $0.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower payroll and legal expenses, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation.  
  In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, other gains and charges were $6.1 million.  We recorded restaurant closure charges of $2.5 million primarily related to lease termination charges for restaurants closed during the quarter.  Additionally, we incurred $2.5 million of professional fees and severance associated with information technology restructuring. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, other gains and charges were $1.7 million consisting primarily of severance charges and transaction costs, partially offset by a gain on the sale of property.  
  Interest expense increased approximately $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the respective prior year period primarily due to higher average borrowing balances. 

INCOME TAXES 
  The effective income tax rate decreased to 29.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 31.9% in the prior year comparable period primarily due to lower profits and the extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit ("WOTC"). The extension of the WOTC legislation was not enacted until December 2015, and as a result, was not considered in our estimated tax provision  until the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Cash Flows 
  Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
  During the   first three months   of fiscal   2017  , net cash flow provided by operating activities was   $66.2 million   compared to   $45.9 million   in the prior year.  First quarter fiscal 2016 cash from operations was negatively impacted by the settlement of liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition of Pepper Dining. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, cash flow from operations increased due to a lower pay-out of performance-based compensation, partially offset by decreased earnings in the current year.

     Table of Contents  

Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities 

Capital expenditures increased to approximately   $27.1 million   for the   first three months   of fiscal   2017   compared to   $23.7 million   for the prior year primarily due to new restaurant construction.  
  On June 25, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Pepper Dining, a franchisee of 103 Chili's Grill   Bar restaurants, for $105.6 million.   
  Cash Flow (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities for the   first three months   of fiscal   2017   increased to   $36.4 million   from net cash provided by financing activities of   $91.6 million   in the prior year primarily due to increases in spending on share repurchases and net payment activity on the revolver, payment of debt issuance costs, and a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and an increase in proceeds from issuance of treasury stock.  
  In September 2016, we entered into a $300.0 million accelerated share repurchase agreement ("ASR Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. ( BofA ).  Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, we paid BofA $300.0 million in cash, and on September 26, 2016, we received an initial delivery of approximately 4.6 million shares of common stock. Additional shares may be received at final settlement and/or on a monthly basis prior to final settlement, based generally on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the Company s common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount.  Final settlement of the ASR Agreement will occur no later than March 31, 2017, although the settlement may be accelerated at BofA s option. We also repurchased approximately 1.0 million additional shares of common stock for a total of   5.6 million   shares repurchased during the   first quarter   of fiscal   2017   for   $350.0 million  .  The repurchased shares included shares purchased as part of our share repurchase program and shares repurchased to satisfy team member tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted shares. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, and pursuant to the ASR Agreement, we received 483,423 shares of our common stock from BofA on the October 31, 2016 scheduled interim delivery date.   The initial shares received pursuant to the ASR Agreement had no material impact on diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the timing of the 
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

initial delivery, but will have a beneficial impact on diluted earnings per share for the remaining quarter and year-to-date periods of fiscal 2017. 
  During the first two months of fiscal   2017  ,   $70.0 million   was drawn from the $750 million revolving credit facility primarily to fund share repurchases for which we repaid a total of   $20.0 million  . On September 13, 2016, we amended the revolving credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity from $750 million to $1 billion. We capitalized debt issuance costs of   $4.0 million   associated with the amendment of the revolving credit facility which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2016.  Subsequent to the amendment, we repaid an additional   $13.0 million  . 
  On September 23, 2016, we completed the private offering of $350 million of our   5.0%   senior notes due   October 2024  .  We received proceeds of   $350.0 million   prior to debt issuance costs of   $5.9 million   and utilized the proceeds to fund a $300 million accelerated share repurchase agreement and to repay   $50 million   on the amended $1 billion revolving credit facility.  The notes require semi-annual interest payments beginning on April 1, 2017. 
  Under the amended $1 billion revolving credit facility, the maturity date for $890.0 million of the facility is extended from March 12, 2020 to September 12, 2021 and the remaining $110.0 million remains due on March 12, 2020. The amended  revolving credit facility bears interest of LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which is a function of our credit rating and debt to cash flow ratio, but is subject to a maximum of LIBOR plus   2.00%  . Based on our current credit rating, we are paying interest at a rate of LIBOR plus   1.38%   for a total of   1.90%  .   One month LIBOR   at   September 28, 2016   was approximately   0.52%  . As of   September 28, 2016  ,   $482.8 million   of credit is available under the revolving credit facility. As of   September 28, 2016  , we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. 
  As of   September 28, 2016  , our credit rating by Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") and Standard and Poor s ( S P ) was BB+ (non-investment grade) and our Corporate Family Rating by Moody's was Ba1 (non-investment grade), all with a stable outlook.  In August 2016, Fitch downgraded Brinker from BBB- (investment grade) to BB+ (non-investment grade) with a stable outlook and in September confirmed the rating. In September 2016, S P downgraded Brinker's corporate credit rating from BBB- (investment grade) to BB+ (non-investment grade) with a stable outlook and Moody's downgraded Brinker's Corporate Family Rating from Baa3 (investment grade) to Ba1 (non-investment grade) with a stable outlook. Our goal is to maintain strong free cash flow to support leverage that we believe is appropriate to allow ongoing investment in the business and return of capital to shareholders. 
  We paid dividends of   $18.3 million   to common stock shareholders in the   first quarter   of fiscal   2017   compared to   $18.1 million   in dividends paid in the same period of fiscal 2016. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a 6.25% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.32 to $0.34 per share effective with the dividend declared in August 2016 of   $18.6 million   which was paid on   September 29, 2016  .  We will continue to target a 40 percent dividend payout ratio to provide additional return to shareholders through dividend payments. 
  In August 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a   $150.0 million   increase to our existing share repurchase program resulting in total authorizations of $4.3 billion. As of   September 28, 2016  , approximately $  135.8 million   was available under our share repurchase authorizations. Our stock repurchase plan has been and will be used to return capital to shareholders and to minimize the dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards. Repurchased common stock is reflected as an increase in treasury stock within shareholders  deficit. 
  During the   first three months   of fiscal   2017  , approximately   127,000   stock options were exercised resulting in cash proceeds of   $3.4 million  .      We received an excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation of approximately   $1.0 million  , net of a   $0.5 million   tax deficiency, during the   first three months   of fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the normally scheduled vesting and distribution of restricted stock grants and performance shares and stock option exercises. The excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation represents the additional income tax benefit received resulting from the increase in the fair value of awards from the time of grant to the exercise date. 

Cash Flow Outlook 
  We believe that our various sources of capital, including future cash flow from operating activities and availability under our existing credit facility are adequate to finance operations and the repayment of current debt obligations for the foreseeable future. We are not aware of any other event or trend that would potentially affect our liquidity. In the event such a trend develops, we believe that there are sufficient funds available under our credit facility and from our internal cash generating capabilities to adequately manage our ongoing business. We periodically evaluate ways to monetize the value of our owned real estate and should alternatives become available that are more cost effective than our financing options currently available, we will consider execution of those alternatives.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230).  This update provides clarification regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The update will be applied on a retrospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718).  This update was issued as part of the FASB s simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. This update will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a cumulative effect transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. We have not yet determined the effect of this update on our ongoing financial reporting.  
    
    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  This update requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a corresponding right-of-use asset. The update also requires additional disclosures about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This update is effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. This update will be applied on a modified retrospective basis. We have not yet determined the effect of this update on our ongoing financial reporting.       
    
    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The FASB has subsequently amended this update by issuing additional ASU's that provide clarification and further guidance around areas identified as potential implementation issues.  These updates provide a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. These updates also require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 delaying the effective date of adoption.  These updates are now effective for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early application in fiscal 2018 is permitted. These updates permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We do not believe the standard will impact our recognition of revenue from company-owned restaurants or our recognition of royalty fees from franchisees. We are continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions.

Additional shares may be received prior to and/or at final settlement, based generally on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the Company s common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount.

  (b)        Administrative Agent s Fees.    The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its sole account, the fees separately agreed upon with the Administrative Agent in the Bank of America Fee Letter.

  (b)        All interest and fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of   Section 2.07(b)  , by a Bank) of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent error. 
  
   31 

(c)        Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be,   provided  ,   however  , that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. 
  (d)        Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due by the Borrower to any Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing.

If (a) any payment (or purchase pursuant to   Section 2.13  ) of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Advance made to the Borrower is made other than on an Interest Payment Date relating to such Advance, as a result of a prepayment pursuant to   Section 2.06(b)   or   2.14   or acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to   Section 8.01   or for any other reason or as a result of any such purchase; (b) a Eurodollar Rate Advance is converted pursuant to   Section 2.04   at a time other than the end of an Interest Period; or (c) the Borrower fails to make a principal or interest payment with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advance on the date such payment is due and payable, the Borrower shall, upon demand by any Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank any amounts required to compensate such Bank for any additional losses, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of any such payment or purchase, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of reasonably anticipated profits, except in the case of such a purchase pursuant to   Section 2.13  ), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to fund or maintain such Advance. 
  Section 2.12.            Increased Costs.      (a)    If, due to any Change in Law, there shall be any increase in the cost to any Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Advance to the Borrower, then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost.  A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Bank, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of such increased cost.  Promptly after any Bank becomes aware of any such introduction, change or proposed  
  
   32 

compliance, such Bank shall notify the Borrower thereof,   provided   that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect such Bank s rights hereunder, except that such Bank s right to recover such increased costs from the Borrower for any period prior to such notice shall be limited to the period of ninety (90) days immediately prior to the date such notice is given to the Borrower. 
  (b)        If any Bank determines that any Change in Law affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased by or based upon the existence of such Bank s Advances or commitment to lend to the Borrower hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon receipt of a demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall, within ten (10) days of such demand, notify such Bank and the Administrative Agent if the Borrower desires to replace such Bank in accordance with   Section 2.13  .  If the Borrower either fails to notify such Bank and the Administrative Agent in accordance with the prior sentence or fails to replace such Bank within the time periods specified in   Section 2.13  , the Borrower shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such Bank s commitment to lend hereunder.  A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Bank shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent error. 
  Section 2.13.            Replacement of Banks  .  In the event that (a) any Bank makes a demand for payment under   Section 2.07(b)     or   Section 2.12  , (b) the Borrower is required to make any payment in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to   Section 2.15   or (c) any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank, the Borrower may within ninety (90) days of the applicable event, if no Default then exists, replace such Bank with another commercial bank, financial institution or other Person in accordance with all of the provisions of   Section 10.06(a)   (including execution of an appropriate Assignment),   provided   that (i) all obligations of such Bank to lend hereunder shall be terminated and the Advances payable to such Bank and all other obligations owed to such Bank hereunder shall be purchased in full without recourse at par plus accrued interest at or prior to such replacement, (ii) such replacement shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (iii) if such replacement bank is not already a Bank hereunder, the Borrower (and, for avoidance of doubt, not the replacement bank) shall pay to the Administrative Agent an assignment fee of $3,500 in connection with such replacement, (iv) such replacement shall, from and after such replacement, be deemed for all purposes to be a  Bank  hereunder with a Commitment in the amount of the respective Commitment of the assigning Bank immediately prior to such replacement (plus, if such replacement bank is already a Bank prior to such replacement, the respective Commitment of such Bank prior to such replacement), as such amount may be changed from time to time pursuant hereto, and shall have all of the rights, duties and obligations hereunder of the Bank being replaced, and (v) such other actions shall be taken by the Borrower, such Bank and such replacement bank as may be appropriate to effect the replacement of such Bank with such replacement bank on terms such that such replacement bank has the same rights, duties and obligations hereunder as such Bank (including, without limitation, execution and delivery of new Notes to such replacement bank if such replacement bank shall so  
  
   33 

request, redelivery to the Borrower in due course of any Notes payable to such Bank and specification of the information contemplated by   Schedule I   as to such replacement bank). 
  Section 2.14.            Illegality and Unavailability.      (a)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority shall assert that it is     unlawful, for such Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to make any Eurodollar Rate Advance or to continue to fund or maintain any Eurodollar Rate Advance hereunder, then, on notice thereof to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent, 
  (i)        the obligation of such Bank to make any Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Bank that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and 
  (ii)        the Eurodollar Rate Advances then outstanding of such Bank, together with all accrued interest thereon and all amounts payable pursuant to   Section 2.11  , shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Advances, or, at the option of the Borrower, prepaid in full, unless such Bank shall determine in good faith in its sole opinion that it is lawful to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Advances made by such Bank to the end of the Interest Period then applicable thereto. 
  (b)        If, with respect to any conversion of a Base Rate Advance to a Eurodollar Rate Advance or the continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Advance pursuant to   Section 2.04  : 
  (i)        the Administrative Agent is unable to determine the Eurodollar Rate for the applicable Eurodollar Rate Advance as a result of one or more of the circumstances provided in   Section 2.03(d)(iii)  ; or 
  (ii)        the Majority Banks advise the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of maintaining the applicable Eurodollar Rate Advance; 
  then the Administrative Agent forthwith shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of the Banks to convert or continue after the current Interest Period(s) any Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. 
  Section 2.15.            Taxes.      (a)    Any and all payments by the Borrower or   the  a   Guarantor hereunder or under the Notes or any other Credit Document shall be made in accordance with   Section 2.10  , and subject to applicable law and   Sections 2.15(c)  ,   2.15(e)   and   2.16  , free and clear of and without deduction for any and all taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect thereto, and all liabilities with respect thereto, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto (all such taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as    Taxes   ).  If the Borrower or   the  a   Guarantor shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable by it hereunder or under any Note or other Credit Document to any Bank or the Administrative Agent, (y) the Borrower or   the  such   Guarantor, as the case may be, shall make such deductions and (z) the Borrower or   the  such   Guarantor,  
  
   34 

as the case may be, shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations, and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower or   the  such   Guarantor, as the case may be, shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
  (b)        In addition, the Borrower or   the  a   Guarantor, as the case may be, agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made by the Borrower or   the  such   Guarantor hereunder or under any Note or other Credit Document executed by it or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note or other Credit Document (hereinafter referred to as    Other Taxes   ). 
  (c)        Within thirty (30) days after the date of the payment of Taxes by or at the direction of the Borrower or   the  such   Guarantor, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in   Section 10.02  , the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.  If a Bank receives from the relevant jurisdiction imposing such Tax a refund of a specific Tax item for which it has been indemnified by the Borrower with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 2.15  , it shall pay the Borrower an amount equal to such refund, together with any interest paid by such jurisdiction with respect to such refund,   provided   that the Borrower, upon the request of such Bank, agrees to promptly repay the amount (or portion thereof) paid over to the Borrower by such Bank in the event such Bank is required to repay the refund (or portion thereof) to such jurisdiction. 
  (d)        Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower or the   Guarantor  Guarantors   hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the parties contained in this   Section 2.15   shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under the Notes and other Credit Documents. 
  (e)        Each Bank that is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America or any state or political subdivision thereof (for purposes of this   Section 2.15(e)  , each a    Non-U.S. Bank   ) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to Effective Date or upon the effectiveness of any Assignment, or at such other times prescribed by applicable law, (i) two (2) properly completed and signed originals of United States of America Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN-E, W-BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying that such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party that eliminates or reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, or (ii) if such Non-U.S. Bank is not a  bank  or other Person described in Code Section 881(c)(3), two properly completed and signed originals of a statement substantially in the form of   Exhibit E   hereto, together with two properly completed and signed originals of Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN-E (or W-BEN if applicable), upon which the Borrower is entitled to rely, from any such Non-U.S. Bank or any successor applicable form, together with any other certificate or statement of exemption or reduction required under the  
  
   35 

Code, in order to establish that such Non-U.S. Bank is entitled to treat the interest payments under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as portfolio interest that is exempt from withholding tax under the Code.  Thereafter, upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each such Non-U.S. Bank shall (A) upon the obsolescence of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Bank, promptly submit to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower such additional properly completed and signed originals of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United States laws and regulations to qualify for a deduction in United States withholding taxes, or such evidence as is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of an available exemption from United States withholding taxes, in respect of all payments to be made to such Non-U.S. Bank by the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Documents, and (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption.  If a payment made to a Bank hereunder or under any Note or other Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Bank shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Bank has complied with such Bank s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this   paragraph (e)  ,  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  A Non-U.S. Bank shall not be required to deliver any form or statement pursuant to this   Section 2.15   that such Non-U.S. Bank is not legally able to deliver.  The Borrower shall not be required to pay additional amounts to any Bank pursuant to this   Section 2.15   to the extent that such Bank did not qualify for a complete exemption from United States withholding taxes at the time such Bank became a party to this Agreement and to the extent that the obligation to pay additional amounts would not have arisen but for the failure of such Bank to comply with this paragraph (e), except to the extent such Bank is not able to comply as a result of a change in law.  Any assignee of all or any portion of any Bank s rights and obligations under this Agreement shall be subject to this   Section 2.15(e)  .  For purposes of this   Section 2.15  , applicable law includes FATCA. 
  (f)        Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower, any Bank claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this   Section 2.15   shall use its reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policies and requirements of law) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if such a change would reduce any such additional amounts (or any similar amount that may thereafter accrue) and would not, in the sole determination of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. 
  (g)        The Borrower or the   applicable     Guarantor shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as applicable, or required  
  
   36 

to be withheld or deducted from a payment to the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as applicable, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Bank, shall be conclusive absent error. 
  (h)        Each Bank shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Bank (but only to the extent that the Borrower or the   applicable     Guarantor has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower and   the  such   Guarantor to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Bank s failure to comply with the provisions of   Section 10.06(e)    relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Bank, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Credit Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Bank by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent error.

This Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas (except that Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code, which regulates certain revolving credit loan accounts, shall not apply to this Agreement or any other Credit Document). 
  Section 10.08.            Interest.      (a)    It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Administrative Agent and each Bank shall conform strictly to Applicable Usury Laws from time to time in effect.  Accordingly, if the transactions with the Administrative Agent or any Bank contemplated hereby would be usurious under Applicable Usury Laws, then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Notes, or any other agreement entered into in connection with or as security for this Agreement or the Notes, it is agreed as follows:  (i) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under Applicable Usury Laws that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, under this Agreement, the Notes, or under any other agreement entered into in connection with or as security for this Agreement or the Notes shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by such Applicable Usury Laws and any excess shall be canceled automatically and, if theretofore paid, shall at the option of the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, be credited by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, on the principal amount of the obligations owed to the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, by the Borrower or refunded by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, to the Borrower, and (ii) in the event that the maturity of any Advance or other obligation payable to the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, is accelerated or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest under Applicable Usury Laws, may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by such Applicable Usury Laws and excess interest, if any to the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall, at the option of the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, be credited by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, on the principal amount of the obligations owed to the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, by the Borrower or refunded by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, to the Borrower. 
  (b)        In the event that at any time the rate of interest applicable to any Advance made by any Bank would exceed the Maximum Rate, thereby causing the interest payable under this Agreement or the Notes to be limited to the Maximum Rate, then any subsequent reductions in the applicable rate of interest hereunder or under the Notes shall not reduce the rate of interest charged  
  
   68 

hereunder or under the Notes below the Maximum Rate until the total amount of interest accrued under this Agreement and the Notes from and after the date hereof equals the amount of interest that would have accrued hereon or thereon if the rates of interest otherwise applicable to this Agreement and the Notes (without limitation by the Maximum Rate) had at all times been in effect.  In the event that upon the final payment of all of the Advances made by any Bank and termination of all of the Commitments of such Bank, the total amount of interest paid to such Bank hereunder and under the Notes is less than the total amount of interest which would have accrued if the interest rates applicable to such Advances pursuant to   Sections 2.07(a)   and   (b)   had at all times been in effect, then the Borrower agrees to pay to such Bank, to the extent permitted by Applicable Usury Laws, an amount equal to the excess of (a) the lesser of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on such Advances if the Maximum Rate had at all times been in effect or (ii) the amount of interest rates applicable to such Advances pursuant to   Sections 2.07(a)   and   (b)   had at all times been in effect over (b) the amount of interest otherwise accrued on such Advances in accordance with this Agreement. 
  (c)        The maximum non-usurious rate of interest shall be determined, subject to any applicable Federal law to the extent that it permits Banks to contract for, charge, reserve or receive a greater amount of interest than under the Texas Finance Code or other laws of the State of Texas, by utilizing the applicable weekly ceiling from time to time in effect pursuant to Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code.  Pursuant to Section 346.004 of the Texas Finance Code, the parties hereto agree that in no event will the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code be applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents. 
  Section 10.09.            Execution in Counterparts.    This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 
  Section 10.10.            Survival of Agreements, Representations and Warranties, Etc.    All warranties, representations and covenants made by the Borrower or the   Guarantor  Guarantors   or any officer of the Borrower or the   Guarantor  Guarantors   herein or in any certificate or other document delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Banks and shall survive the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the making of the Advances regardless of any investigation.  The indemnities and other obligations of the Borrower contained in this Agreement, and the indemnities by the Banks in favor of the Agent and its officers, directors, employees and agents, will survive the repayment of the Advances and the termination of this Agreement. 
  Section 10.11.            The Borrower s Right to Apply Deposits.    In the event that any Bank is placed in receivership or enters a similar proceeding, the Borrower may, to the full extent permitted by law, make any payment due to such Bank hereunder, to the extent of finally collected unrestricted deposits of the Borrower in U.S. Dollars held by such Bank, by giving notice to the Administrative Agent and such Bank directing such Bank to apply such deposits to such indebtedness.  If the amount of such deposits is insufficient to pay such indebtedness then due and owing in full, the Borrower shall pay the balance of such insufficiency in accordance with this Agreement.

As to matters of fact material to our opinion, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon certificates of representatives of the Borrower and the   Guarantor  Guarantors   and upon representations and warranties set forth in the     Amended   Credit Agreement, and have not conducted any special inquiry or investigation in respect of such matters.

  ASSUMPTIONS 
  In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, with your consent and without any independent investigation, all of the following: 
  
   D-  2

  (C)    that all of the Documents will be performed strictly in accordance with the terms thereof; and 
  (D)    that the representations and warranties as to factual matters contained in the Documents are true and correct. 
  OPINION 
  Based upon the foregoing and having due regard for the legal considerations we deem relevant, and subject to the further qualifications and limitations hereinafter set forth, we are of the opinion that: 
  1.    Each of the Borrower and the   Guarantor  Guarantors   is a corporation     duly incorporated,   validly existing and in good standing under the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the    DGCL   ), and has the corporate power and authority under the DGCL to enter into and perform the     Amended   Credit Agreement and the Notes. 
  2.    The execution and delivery by the Borrower of each of the   Amended     Credit Agreement and the Notes issued on the date hereof and the performance by the Borrower of its obligations thereunder have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Borrower; each of the   Amended     Credit Agreement and the Notes issued on the date hereof has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower; and each of the   Amended     Credit Agreement and the Notes issued on the date hereof constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, in each case except as enforcement of the     Amended   Credit Agreement or the Notes may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,  
  
   D-  3 

reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors  rights generally, and subject to general equity principles and to limitations on availability of equitable relief, including specific performance. 
  3.    The execution and delivery by the   Guarantor  Guarantors   of the     Amended   Credit Agreement and the performance by the   Guarantor  Guarantors   of   its  their respective   obligations thereunder have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate   action  actions   of the   Guarantor  Guarantors  ; the     Amended   Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the   Guarantor  Guarantors  ; and the     Amended   Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the   Guarantor  Guarantors   enforceable against the   Guarantor  Guarantors   in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors  rights generally, and subject to general equity principles and to limitations on availability of equitable relief, including specific performance. 
  4.    Neither the execution and delivery of the   Amended     Credit Agreement or the Notes issued on the date hereof nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein will violate any provision of the Borrower Certificate of Incorporation,   any of     the   Guarantor Certificate  Guarantors Certificates   of Incorporation, the Borrower Bylaws or   any of     the   Guarantor  Guarantors   Bylaws, or to our Knowledge, conflict with or violate any statute, judgment, order, decree or regulation or rule of any court, governmental authority or arbitrator applicable or relating to the Borrower or   any of     the   Guarantor  Guarantors  . 
  5.    To our Knowledge and except as Disclosed, there are  no actions, suits, proceedings or claims or investigations pending or threatened against or affecting the Borrower or   any of     the   Guarantor  Guarantors   or any of their respective properties before any court, governmental agency or regulatory authority which would (i) have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) impair the ability of the Borrower or the   Guarantor  Guarantors   to perform their obligations under the     Amended   Credit Agreement or the Notes issued on the date hereof. 
  6.    Neither the Borrower nor   any of     the   Guarantor  Guarantors   is an  investment company  or a company  controlled  by an  investment company  within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
  FURTHER QUALIFICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS 
  The opinions expressed above are expressly subject to the following qualifications and limitations: 
  (a)    We express no opinion as to (i) the specific remedy that any court or other authority or body might grant in connection with the enforcement of rights under any of the Documents, as to the availability of equitable remedies, as such, in connection with the enforcement of such rights, or as to the effects of the application of principles of equity (regardless of whether  
  
   D-  4 

enforcement is considered in proceedings in law or in equity), (ii) the application of any securities laws to any of the transactions contemplated by any of the Documents, or (iii) the effect of any environmental, antitrust or tax laws of the United States of America or of the State of Texas. 
  (b)    We express no opinion as to the validity or enforceability of (i) any provisions purporting to entitle a party to indemnification or release from liability in respect of any matters arising in whole or in part by reason of any illegal, wrongful, knowing or negligent act or omission of such party, (ii) any provisions that purport to restrict access to or waive remedies or defenses, to waive any rights to notices or to establish evidentiary standards, (iii) any provisions relating to liquidated damages, set-offs, waivers, releases, suretyship defenses, delays or omissions of enforcement of rights or remedies, severability, consent judgments or summary proceedings, (iv) any provisions purporting to irrevocably appoint attorneys-in-fact or other agents, (v) any provisions purporting to restrict or limit transfer, alienation or encumbrancing of property, (vi) any provisions that relate to submissions to jurisdiction, waivers or ratifications of future acts, the rights of, third parties or transferability of assets which by their nature are nontransferable, (vii) provisions that contain any agreement to agree, or (viii) provisions that purport to negate or control over present or future laws which are contrary to such provisions. 
  (c)    To the extent that the opinions given in Sections 2, 3 and 4 constitute opinions with respect to laws relating to usury, such opinions are expressly limited to the opinion that the     Amended   Credit Agreement and the Notes do not require the payment of interest at a rate which is usurious.  In rendering such opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the applicability of Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, as currently in effect, and have assumed that (i) there are no fees, points or other charges or forms of compensation to the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, or any Bank in respect of the   Amended     Credit Agreement or the issuance of the Notes or any commitment to pay any such charges or other forms of compensation, other than those specifically disclosed in the     Amended   Credit Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the Bank of America Fee Letter, the JPMCB Fee Letter,   the Regions Fee Letter,     the Wells Fargo Fee Letter and the Upfront Fee Letter, (ii) all fees and charges provided for in the     Amended   Credit Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the Bank of America Fee Letter, the JPMCB Fee Letter,   the Regions Fee Letter,     the Wells Fargo Fee Letter and the Upfront Fee Letter to be paid by Borrower or   Guarantor  the Guarantors   to the Administrative Agent, Joint Lead Arrangers and Book Runners, the Syndication Agents or any Bank constitute bona fide commitment fees, arrangement fees, or administrative agent s fees, as applicable, and not interest, (iii) all charges for reimbursement of services paid to third parties will be for actual out-of-pocket expenses paid to third parties for services actually rendered by such parties, (iv) the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Banks, the Borrower and the   Guarantor  Guarantors   will comply with the  usury savings clause  and other provisions of the   Amended     Credit Agreement to the effect that the Borrower and the   Guarantor  Guarantors   will never be required to pay interest (including all compensation that constitutes interest under applicable law) on the Notes or otherwise in respect of the     Amended   Credit Agreement in excess of the maximum rate or amount of interest that may lawfully be contracted for, charged or collected thereon or in connection therewith under applicable Texas law  
  
   D-  5 

(collectively, the    Savings Clauses   ), and (v) in complying with the provisions of the Saving Clauses, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and such Bank will give due consideration to all fees, charges or other compensation which under applicable Texas law may be or is deemed to be interest. 
  (d)    We are members of the Bar of the State of Texas. This opinion relates only to the Federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of Texas and the DGCL as currently in effect, and we express no opinion with regard to any matters that may be governed or affected by any other laws. 
  (e)    This opinion is limited solely to the matters stated herein and no opinion is to be inferred or may be implied beyond the matters expressly stated herein. 
  The opinions expressed herein are solely for the benefit of you and your counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by the     Amended   Credit Agreement and may not be used or relied upon by any other person or entity or for any other purpose whatsoever.  The opinions expressed herein are as of the date first set forth above, and we do not assume or undertake any responsibility or obligation to supplement or to update such opinions to reflect any facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in the laws which may hereafter occur.   11

  CERTIFICATIONS 
  I,   Wyman T. Roberts,   certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Brinker International, Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              A. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              B. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally acceptable accounting principles; 
              C. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              D. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              A. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              B. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
