Note 1   Background and Basis of Presentation  
    
  The Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago is a federally chartered corporation and one of 11 Federal Home Loan Banks (the FHLBs) that, with the Office of Finance, comprise the Federal Home Loan Bank System (the System).  The FHLBs are government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) of the United States of America and were organized under the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, as amended (FHLB Act), in order to improve the availability of funds to support home ownership.    We are supervised and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), an independent federal agency in the executive branch of the United States (U.S.) government.  
    
  Each FHLB is a member-owned cooperative with members from a specifically defined geographic district.  Our defined geographic district is Illinois and Wisconsin.   All federally-insured depository institutions, insurance companies engaged in residential housing finance, credit unions and community development financial institutions located in our district are eligible to apply for membership with us.   All our members are required to purchase our capital stock as a condition of membership.  Our capital stock is not publicly traded, and is issued, repurchased or redeemed at par value, $100 per share, subject to certain statutory and regulatory limits.  As a cooperative, we do business with our members, and former members (under limited circumstances).  Specifically, we provide credit principally in the form of secured loans called advances.  We also provide liquidity for home mortgage loans to members approved as Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) through the Mortgage Partnership Finance        (MPF       ) Program.   
    
  Our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP).  Amounts in prior periods may be reclassified to conform to the current presentation and if material are disclosed in the following notes. 
    
  In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information.  These unaudited financial statements and the following footnotes should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (  2015   Form 10-K) starting on page F-1, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
    
  Unless otherwise specified, references to we, us, our, and the Bank are to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago.   
    
   Mortgage Partnership Finance ,  MPF ,  MPF Xtra , and "Community First" are registered trademarks of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. 
    
  Refer to the   Glossary of Terms   starting on page 63 for the definitions of certain terms used herein. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make assumptions and estimates that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expense. The most significant of these assumptions and estimates applies to fair value measurements and allowance for credit losses.   Actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates.   
    
  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities 
    
  We would consolidate a variable interest entity if we determine that we are its primary beneficiary, which occurs when both conditions shown below are met. 

We have the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance. 

We have the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. 
       
  We did not consolidate any of our investments in variable interest entities since we are not the primary beneficiary. We classify variable interest entities as investment securities in our statements of condition.  Such investment securities include, but are not limited to, senior interests in private-label mortgage backed securities (MBS) and Federal Family Education Loan Program asset backed securities (FFELP ABS).  Our maximum loss exposure for these investment securities is limited to their carrying amounts.  We have no liabilities related to these investments in variable interest entities. We have not provided financial or other support (explicitly or implicitly) to these investment securities that we were not previously contractually required to provide, nor do we intend to provide such support in the future.

Gross versus Net Presentation of Financial Instruments 
    
  We present derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis in our statements of condition on the basis that our right to net amounts due to our clearing agents and/or our counterparties is enforceable at law upon early termination. We include accrued interest receivable/payable and cash collateral, including initial and variation margin, in the carrying amount of a derivative. Derivatives are netted by contract (e.g., master netting agreement), to discharge all or a portion of the amounts that would be owed to our counterparty by applying them against the amounts that our counterparty owes to us. Additionally, we clear certain derivatives transactions with clearinghouses classified as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO), through Futures Commission Merchants (FCM). If these netted amounts are positive, they are classified as a derivative asset and if negative, they are classified as a derivative liability.  
    
  The net exposure for these financial instruments can change on a daily basis; therefore, there may be a delay between the time this exposure change is identified and additional collateral is requested, and the time when this collateral is received or pledged. Likewise, there may be a delay for excess collateral to be returned. For derivative instruments that meet the netting requirements, any excess cash collateral received or pledged is recognized as a derivative liability or asset. 
    
  Refer to   Note 9 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities   for further details. 
    
  Our policy is to report securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, if any, and securities borrowing transactions, if any, on a gross basis. 

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
    
  Our   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   through December 31, 2015, can be found in   Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   to the financial statements in our 2015 Form 10-K.    We adopted the following policies in 2016: 
    
  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost (i.e., Concession Fees) 
    
  In April of 2015, the FASB issued new guidance requiring any concession fee to be presented as a direct deduction from the debt it relates to rather than separately presented as a deferred cost in Other Assets. We retrospectively adopted the new guidance January 1, 2016 by reclassifying deferred concession fees from Other Assets to its related debt, which at the time of adoption included our Consolidated obligation discount notes, Consolidated obligation bonds and Subordinated notes.  This reclassification did not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or percentage net interest yield on our consolidated obligations at the time of adoption. 
    
  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships 
    
  In March of 2016, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying that a change in counterparty (novation) to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument in an existing hedging relationship would not, in and of itself, be considered a termination of  the derivative instrument or be considered a change in the critical term of the hedging relationship.   We early adopted this new guidance on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2016.  The new guidance had no effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows at the time of adoption. 

Note 3   Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments in the Statement of Cash Flows 
    
  I  n August of 2016, the FASB issued statement of cash flows classification guidance governing certain cash receipts and cash payments. The new guidance becomes effective January 1, 2018, with earlier adoption permitted.  The new guidance must be applied retrospectively to each period our statements of cash flows are presented at the time of adoption.  Key provisions relevant to us are outlined below.  Our existing practice is consistent with the provisions of the guidance outlined below pertaining to debt prepayment or extinguishment costs and the classification of accreted interest expense.  We are in the process of reviewing the expected effect of the remaining provisions of the guidance on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Cash payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs are classified as cash outflows for financing activities.

  Notes to Financial Statements - (Unaudited) 
  (Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated) 

At settlement, the portion of the cash payment attributable to accreted interest expense is classified as cash outflows for operating activities, and the portion of the cash payment attributable to the principal would be classified as cash outflows for financing activities.  The cash paid attributable to accreted interest expense also needs to be included in the supplemental disclosure of the amount of interest expense paid. 

A transferor s beneficial interest obtained in a securitization of financial assets is disclosed as a noncash activity.   

Additional guidance is provided to clarify when an entity should separate cash receipts and cash payments and classify them into more than one class of cash flows and when an entity should classify the aggregate of those cash receipts and payments into one class of cash flows on the basis of predominance.    
       
  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
    
  In June of 2016, the FASB amended existing GAAP guidance applicable to measuring credit losses on financial instruments. The amendments are expected to result in recognizing credit losses in the financial statements on a timelier basis by utilizing forward looking information.   Key provisions of the amendments relevant to us are outlined below. 

Replaces the  incurred loss  impairment methodology applied under current GAAP with an  expected credit losses  methodology.   

The expected credit losses methodology requires us to estimate all credit losses on financial instruments carried on an amortized cost basis and off-balance-sheet credit exposures over their contractual term.  On balance sheet financial instruments include, but are not limited to, advances, MPF Loans held in portfolio, and Held-to-maturity (HTM) securities. Off-balance-sheet credit exposure refers to unfunded credit exposures, such as standby letters of credit.  

The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial instrument s reported amount.     

Aligns the income statement recognition of credit losses for securities with the reporting period in which changes in collectability occur by recording credit losses (and subsequent reversals) through an allowance rather than a write-down as currently required under GAAP.   

Requires recognition of a credit loss on available-for-sale (AFS) securities into the income statement if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected on the security is less than its amortized cost basis.  Additionally, the allowance on AFS debt securities will be limited to the amount by which fair value is less than the amortized cost. 

Expands upon the current credit quality disclosures by requiring further disaggregation of financial instruments by their year of origination.  This disclosure is expected to help financial statement users better understand credit quality trends of asset portfolios.  
       
  The amendments become effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted effective January 1, 2019.  We plan to implement the expected credit loss methodology through a cumulative-effect adjustment to our beginning retained earnings as of the first reporting period in which the new guidance becomes effective for us. The cumulative effect adjustment will equal the amount required to adjust our existing allowance for credit losses for our on balance-sheet financial instruments and other liabilities for our off-balance sheet financial instruments to the amounts determined under the expected credit losses methodology.  A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before our effective date.  This means write-downs recognized prior to our effective date on securities may not be reversed at the time of our adoption.  Instead, improvements in expected cash flows that exist at the time we adopt will continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the security.  Additionally, recoveries of amounts previously written off prior to the date of adoption will be recorded in earnings when received.  We are in the process of reviewing the expected effect of this guidance on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
    
  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments 
    
  In March of 2016, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying the requirements for assessing whether a contingent call (put) option embedded in a debt instrument is clearly and closely related to that debt instrument, which is referred to as the "host contract". Specifically, entities no longer will be required to assess whether the event triggering the acceleration of an embedded contingent call (put) option within a debt instrument is clearly and closely related to its host contract.  We plan to adopt the new guidance using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2017.  The new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows at the time of adoption.

Leases 
    
  In February of 2016, the FASB issued new guidance pertaining to lease accounting. Key lessee accounting provisions relevant to us are outlined below.   Our existing practice is to record our operating leases off-balance sheet. 

Recognize operating leases and right-to-use assets in our statements of condition; however, we would be permitted to elect off-balance sheet recognition of such leases having a term of 12 months or less.  

Recognize a single lease cost over the lease term on a straight-line basis. 

Classify all cash payments within operating activities in our statement of cash flows. 
       
  The new guidance becomes effective January 1, 2019.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required to be applied to leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  We do not expect the new guidance to have a significant effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows since our existing off-balance sheet operating leases are not material.  
    
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
    
  In January of 2016, the FASB issued new guidance governing recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.  The key provisions applicable to us include, but are not limited to, the following: 

The ability to elect the fair value option will continue to be permitted. 

Requires recognizing the portion of the total change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income when we elect to carry that liability at fair value under the fair value option. 

Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category, such as amortized cost, and form, such as securities or loans, on our statements of condition or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.   

The new guidance becomes effective January 1, 2018.  We are in the process of reviewing its expected effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
    
  In May of 2014, the FASB issued new guidance governing revenue recognition from contracts with customers. In August of 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of this new guidance until January 1, 2018.  Subsequently, the FASB has issued several pronouncements that provide additional guidance and clarifications to the revenue recognition guidance issued in May of 2014.   The new revenue recognition guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows at the time of adoption because the majority of our financial instruments and other contractual rights are within the scope of other GAAP guidance; and accordingly, are excluded from the scope of this new revenue recognition guidance.

Aging of Unrealized Temporary Losses 
    
  The following tables present unrealized temporary losses on our AFS and HTM portfolio for periods less than 12 months and for 12 months or more. We recognized   no   OTTI charges on these unrealized loss positions because we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, we do not intend to sell these securities, and we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell them prior to recovering their amortized cost basis.  In the tables below, in cases where the gross unrealized losses for an investment category are less than $1 million, the losses are not reported.

Contractual Maturity Terms 
    
  The following table primarily presents the amortized cost basis and fair value of U.S. Government   other government related AFS and HTM securities by contractual maturity.   ABS and MBS securities are excluded since their expected maturities may differ from their contractual maturities if borrowers of the underlying loans elect to prepay their loans.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis 

We had   no   OTTI for the periods presented based on the significant inputs, key modeling assumptions, and methodologies outlined below. 
    
  We assess an HTM or AFS private-label MBS security for OTTI whenever its fair value is less than its amortized cost basis as of the reporting date.  Specifically, we determine OTTI, if any, by performing a cash flow analysis for substantially all of these private-label MBS securities utilizing two independent third party models, which are described further below. Our analysis generates cash flow projections utilizing significant inputs, key modeling assumptions, and methodologies provided by the FHLB System OTTI Committee, which was established to achieve consistent OTTI analyses for private-label MBS among FHLBs.  We are still responsible, however, for making our own OTTI determination, which involves determining the reasonableness of these significant inputs, assumptions, and methodologies, as well as performing the required present value calculations using appropriate historical cost bases and yields.  We then utilize these cash flow projections to determine if OTTI exists on our private-label MBS. 

First model.  This model considers borrower characteristics and the particular attributes of the loans underlying the securities, in conjunction with assumptions about future changes in home prices and interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, and loss severities.  A significant input to the first model is the forecast of future housing price changes for the relevant states and core based statistical areas (CBSAs), which are based upon an assessment of the individual housing markets. Outputs from this first model are then used as inputs by the second model as follows. 

Second model.  This model uses the month-by-month projections of future loan performance derived from the first model and allocates the projected loan level cash flows and losses to the various security classes in the securitization structure in accordance with its prescribed cash flow and loss allocation rules.  
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a short-term housing price forecast over all markets with projected changes ranging from   -1.0%   to   +10.0%   over the twelve month period beginning July 1, 2016.  For the vast majority of markets, the short-term forecast has changes ranging from   +3.0%   to   +6.0%  .   
    
  The following table presents the changes in the cumulative amount of previously recorded OTTI credit losses (recognized into earnings) on investment securities for the reporting periods indicated. 

Ongoing Litigation 
    
  On October 15, 2010, we instituted litigation relating to   64   private-label MBS bonds we purchased in an aggregate original principal amount of   $4.29 billion  .  In April 2016, we received a payment of   $37.5 million   (partially offset by   $5.0 million   of related legal fees and other expenses) resulting from a settlement with some of the defendants.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining litigation covers   four   private-label MBS bonds in the aggregate original principal amount of   $77.5 million  .

  We offer a wide range of fixed- and variable-rate advance products with different maturities, interest rates, payment characteristics and optionality.  
    
  The following table presents our advances by terms of maturity.  Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay advances with or without penalties. 

a   
    The weighted average interest rate is relatively lower when compared to other categories due to a majority of advances in this category consisting of variable rate advances which reset periodically at current interest rates.

Note 7   MPF Loans Held in Portfolio 
    
  We acquire MPF Loans from PFIs to hold in our portfolio, and in some cases we purchased participations in pools of eligible mortgage loans from other FHLBs (MPF Banks).  MPF Loans that are held in portfolio are fixed-rate conventional and government mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties with maturities ranging from 5 years to 30 years or participations in pools of similar eligible mortgage loans from other MPF Banks.   
    
  The following table presents information on MPF Loans held in portfolio by contractual maturity at the time of purchase.   

See   Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses     to the financial statements for information related to our credit losses on MPF Loans held in portfolio.  
    
  In addition to our portfolio MPF Products, PFIs sell eligible MPF Loans to us through the MPF Program infrastructure and we concurrently sell them to third party investors or hold MPF Loans in our held for sale portfolio in other assets for a short period of time until such loans are pooled into MBS.

Note 8   Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  See   Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   to the financial statements in our 2015 Form 10-K for further details pertaining to the methodologies and factors we consider when determining the amount to recognize as an allowance for credit losses, if any, for each portfolio segment identified below. 
    
  We have identified our portfolio segments as shown below: 
    
     Member credit products (advances, letters of credit and other extensions of credit to borrowers);  
     Conventional MPF Loans held in portfolio; 
     Government Loans held in portfolio; and 
     Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell. 
    
  Member Credit Products 
    
  We have not recorded any allowance for credit losses for our member credit products portfolio segment based upon our credit analysis and the repayment history on member credit products.  We had no member credit products that were past due, on nonaccrual status, involved in a troubled debt restructuring or otherwise considered impaired.  We have not recorded a separate liability to reflect credit losses on our member credit products with off-balance sheet credit exposure.  
    
  Conventional MPF Loans Held in Portfolio 
    
  For further detail of our   MPF Risk Sharing Structure   see page F-14 in our 2015 Form 10-K.  There has been   no   material activity in our allowance for credit losses since   December 31, 2015  .  The following table presents the recorded investment and the allowance for credit losses in conventional MPF Loans by impairment methodology.  Recorded investment in a conventional MPF Loan is its amortized cost basis plus related accrued interest receivable, if any.  Recorded investment is not net of its allowance for credit losses but is net of any direct charge-off on the conventional MPF Loan. 

Government Loans Held in Portfolio 
    
  Servicing PFIs are responsible for absorbing any losses incurred on Government Loans held in portfolio that are not recovered from the government insurer or guarantor.  We did not establish an allowance for credit losses on our Government Loans held in portfolio for the reporting periods presented based on our assessment that our servicing PFIs have the ability to absorb such losses.  Further, Government Loans were not placed on nonaccrual status or disclosed as troubled debt restructurings for the same reason.

Credit Quality Indicators - MPF Loans Held in Portfolio 
    
  The following table summarizes our recorded investment in MPF Loans by our key credit quality indicators, which include: 

"Serious delinquency rate" consists of MPF Loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure, as a percentage of the total recorded investment. MPF Loans that are both 90 days or more past due and in the process of foreclosure are only included once in our serious delinquency rate calculation. 
                
    "Past due 90 days or more still accruing interest" consists of MPF Loans that are either insured or guaranteed by the government or conventional mortgage loans that are well secured (by collateral that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt or by the guarantee or insurance, such as Primary Mortgage Insurance, of a financially responsible party) and in the process of collection. 

Individually Evaluated Impaired MPF Loans 
    
  The following table summarizes the recorded investment, unpaid principal balance, and related allowance for credit losses attributable to individually evaluated impaired conventional MPF Loans.  Conventional MPF Loans are individually evaluated for impairment when they are adversely classified.  There is   no   allowance for credit losses attributable to conventional MPF Loans that are individually evaluated for impairment, since the related allowance for credit losses have been charged off.  

The following table summarizes the average recorded investment of impaired conventional MPF Loans.  We do not recognize interest income on impaired loans. 

Term Federal Funds Sold and Term Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell 
    
  We only had credit risk exposure to overnight Federal Funds sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .  We did not have any term Federal Funds sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell arrangements. We did not establish an allowance for credit losses for our overnight Federal Funds sold since all Federal Funds sold were repaid according to their contractual terms.  We also did not establish an allowance for credit losses for overnight Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell since all payments due under the contractual terms have been received and we hold sufficient underlying collateral.

Note 9   Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
    
  Refer to   Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   in our 2015 Form 10-K for our accounting policies for derivatives.   
    
  We transact most of our derivatives with large banks and major broker-dealers.  Some of these banks and broker-dealers or their affiliates buy, sell, and distribute consolidated obligations.  Derivative transactions may be entered into through an over-the-counter bilateral agreement with an individual counterparty.  Additionally, we clear some derivatives transactions with clearinghouses classified as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) through a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), a clearing member of the DCO.  We are not a derivatives dealer and do not trade derivatives for speculative purposes. 

Managing Credit Risk on Derivative Agreements 
    
  We are subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative agreements.  For bilateral derivative agreements, the degree of counterparty risk depends on the extent to which master netting arrangements, collateral requirements and other credit enhancements are included in such contracts to mitigate the risk.  We manage counterparty credit risk through credit analysis, collateral requirements and adherence to the requirements set forth in our policies and FHFA regulations.  We require collateral agreements on all derivatives that establish collateral delivery thresholds.  Additionally, collateral related to derivatives with member institutions includes collateral assigned to us, as evidenced by a written security agreement, and held by the member institution for our benefit.  Based on credit analyses and collateral requirements, we do not anticipate any credit losses on our derivative agreements.  See     Note 16 - Fair Value   to the financial statements in our 2015 Form 10-K for discussion regarding our fair value methodology for derivative assets and liabilities, including an evaluation of the potential for the fair value of these instruments to be affected by counterparty credit risk. 
    
  Our over-the-counter bilateral derivative agreements may contain provisions that require us to post additional collateral with our counterparties if there is deterioration in our credit rating, except for those derivative agreements with a zero unsecured collateral threshold for both parties, in which case positions are required to be fully collateralized regardless of credit rating.  If our credit rating is lowered by a major credit rating agency, such as Standard and Poor's or Moody s, we would be required to deliver additional collateral on derivatives in net liability positions.  If our credit rating had been lowered from its current rating to the next lower rating, we would have been required to deliver up to an additional   $43 million   of collateral at fair value to our derivatives counterparties at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Cleared swaps are subject to variation and initial margin requirements established by the DCO and its clearing members.  We post variation and initial margin through the FCM, on behalf of the DCO, which could expose us to institutional credit risk in the event that an FCM or the DCO fail to meet their obligations.  Clearing derivatives through a DCO mitigates counterparty credit risk exposure because the DCO is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through an FCM.  The DCO determines initial margin requirements for cleared derivatives.  In this regard, an FCM may require additional initial margin to be posted based on credit considerations, including but not limited to, credit rating downgrades.  We had   no   requirement to post additional initial margin by our FCMs at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We present our derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis in our statements of condition.  Refer to   Note 1 - Background and Basis of Presentation   for further discussion.  In addition to the cash collateral as noted in the following table, we also pledged   $90 million   of investment securities that can be sold or repledged, as part of our initial margin related to cleared derivative transactions at   September 30, 2016  .

a   
    Amounts represent the application of the netting requirements that allow us to settle positive and negative positions and also cash collateral and related accrued interest held or placed by us with the same FCM and/or counterparty. Cash collateral posted was   $910 million   and   $793 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , and cash collateral received was   $29 million   and   $25 million  .

  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $19 million   of additional net credit exposure on cleared derivatives due to our pledging of non-cash collateral to a DCO for initial margin, which exceeded our net derivative liability position.  We had   $50 million   comparable exposure at   December 31, 2015  .

Note 10   Consolidated Obligations 
    
  The FHLBs issue consolidated obligations through the Office of Finance as their agent. Consolidated obligations consist of discount notes and consolidated obligation bonds.  Consolidated discount notes are issued to raise short-term funds, are issued at less than their face amount and redeemed at par value when they mature.  The maturity of consolidated bonds may range from less than   one year   to over   20 years  , but they are not subject to any statutory or regulatory limits on maturity.  
    
  The following table presents our consolidated obligation bonds, for which we are the primary obligor, including callable bonds that are redeemable in whole, or in part, at our discretion on predetermined call dates.

Note 11   Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) 
    
  Under our Capital Plan our stock consists of two sub-classes of stock, Class B1 activity stock and Class B2 membership stock (together, Class B stock), both with a par value of   $100   and redeemable on   five years  ' written notice, subject to certain conditions.  Under the Capital Plan, each member is required to own capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement or an activity stock requirement.  Class B1 activity stock is available for purchase only to support a member  '  s activity stock requirement.  Class B2 membership stock is available to be purchased to support a member  '  s membership stock requirement and any activity stock requirement.   
    
  Minimum Capital Requirements 
    
  For details on our minimum capital requirements, including how the ratios below were calculated, see   Minimum Capital Requirements   on page F-42 of our 2015 Form 10-K.  We complied with our minimum regulatory capital requirements as shown below. 

Total regulatory capital and leverage capital includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock (MRCS) but does not include AOCI. Under the FHFA regulation on capital classifications and critical capital levels for the FHLBs, we are adequately capitalized. 
    
  The following members' regulatory capital stock exceeded 10% of our total regulatory capital stock outstanding: 

a   
    One Mortgage Partners Corp. is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank NA. 

Transfer of Capital Stock to Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS) 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, we transferred   $294 million   of our captive insurance company members' capital stock from equity to MRCS in liabilities on our statement of condition.  The transfer was triggered by the issuance of the final FHFA rule on FHLB membership making captive insurance companies ineligible for FHLB membership, which was issued on January 20, 2016 and became effective February 19, 2016.  Under this rule, our three captive insurance company members will have their memberships terminated by February 2021.  The transfer from equity to MRCS in liabilities was required because the new rule creates an unconditional obligation requiring us to redeem our capital stock from our captive insurance company members after their membership terminates.  We reclassify our capital stock from equity to MRCS in liabilities at fair value, which is its par value plus any dividends related to the capital stock.  Par value represents fair value since our capital stock can only be acquired and redeemed or repurchased at par value. Further, our capital stock is not traded and no market mechanism exists for the exchange of stock outside our cooperative structure.  Upon reclassification to MRCS, subsequent dividends are accrued at the expected dividend rate and reported as a component of interest expense in our statements of income. 
    
  Excess Capital Stock 
    
  In February 2016, we announced significant reductions in our membership stock and activity stock requirements, which went into effect on April 1, 2016. As a result of these changes, we held   $593 million   of excess capital stock on April 1, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, we held excess capital stock of   $419 million  .  The reduction was a result of members requesting repurchase of their excess stock and members utilizing excess stock to support new advance borrowing activities.

  The following tables are a summary of the fair value estimates and related levels in the fair value hierarchy.  The carrying amounts are as recorded in the statements of condition.  These tables do not represent an estimate of our overall market value as a going concern; as they do not take into account future business opportunities and future net profitability of assets and liabilities.  We had   no   transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy for the periods shown. 
    
  The following table shows the fair values of financial instruments that are measured at amortized cost on our statements of condition, unless we elect the fair value option for such instruments, in which case, such instruments are measured at fair value on our statements of condition.

Fair Value Option 
    
  We elect the fair value option for financial instruments, such as advances, MPF Loans held for sale, discount notes, and consolidated obligation bonds, in cases where hedge accounting treatment may not be achieved. Specifically, hedge accounting may not be achieved in cases where it may be difficult to pass prospective or retrospective effectiveness testing under derivative hedge accounting guidance even though the derivatives used to hedge these financial instruments have matching terms.  Accordingly, electing the fair value option allows us to better match the change in fair value of these financial instruments with the derivative economically hedging them. 

The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate unpaid principal balance (UPB) outstanding and the aggregate fair value for our long term financial instruments for which the fair value option has been elected.    None   of the advances were 90 days or more past due and   none   were on nonaccrual status.

Executive Summary 
    
  Third Quarter 2016 Financial Highlights 

Net interest income for the third quarter of 2016 was $113 million, which included $9 million of income from investment security prepayments during the period. For the third quarter of 2015, net interest income was $122 million, which included $11 million of income from investment security prepayments during the period. While our legacy investment portfolio continues to pay down, investments that were indexed to three-month LIBOR benefited from the increase in three-month LIBOR rates. Separately, debt hedged with three-month LIBOR swaps was negatively impacted by higher three-month LIBOR rates. In addition, we have issued more long term debt at higher rates.   
                
    Noninterest gain (loss) for the third quarter of 2016 was $14 million, up from a loss of $6 million for the third quarter of 2015 as we experienced increased gains on our balance sheet hedging activities. 
                
    Noninterest expense increased to $42 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $35 million for the third quarter of 2015, with the increase driven mainly by an increase in compensation and benefits.  
                  
    MPF Loans held in portfolio remained relatively flat from December 31, 2015, to September 30, 2016, as new MPF Loan volume helped offset paydown and maturity activity during the period. 
                  
    We remained in compliance with all of our regulatory capital requirements as of September 30, 2016. 
       
  Summary and Outlook  
    
  Third Quarter 2016 Dividend 
    
  On October 27, 2016, the Bank's Board of Directors maintained the dividend levels for the third quarter of 2016.  The Board again recognized our members that borrow from the Bank by declaring a dividend of 2.80% (annualized) for Class B1 activity capital stock, based on the Bank s preliminary financial results for the third quarter of 2016. The Board also declared a 0.60% dividend (annualized) for Class B2 membership capital stock.  
  Member Owned and Member Focused 
    
  At September 30, 2016, advances were $43.1 billion, up 17% from December 31, 2015, and letters of credit were $10.4 billion, up 56% from December 31, 2015. As the Bank s members seek ways to increase their non-interest income, the volume in the traditional MPF products has continued to grow as well.  
    
  The Bank continues to focus on its members by striving to understand what members need from the Bank beyond serving as a reliable source of liquidity. The Bank continues to evaluate its performance by measuring how well it is enhancing the value of membership in the Bank.  
    
  The Bank s Community First        Disaster Relief Program is one way in which the Bank is supporting its members and their needs. In late September, the Bank funded the program with $500,000 to help northern Wisconsin communities hit by the severe storms and flooding that occurred on July 11-12, 2016.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income is the difference between the amount we recognize into interest income on our interest earning assets and the amount we recognize into interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities.  These amounts were determined in accordance with GAAP and were based on the underlying contractual interest rate terms of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as the following items: 

Net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps that are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges; 
                
    Amortization of premiums; 
                
    Accretion of discounts and OTTI reversals; 
                
    Amortization of hedge adjustments; 
                
    Advance and investment prepayment fees; and 
                
    MPF credit enhancement fees. 

The tables on the following page present the increase or decrease in interest income and expense due to volume or rate variances.  The calculation of these components includes the following considerations: 

Amortized cost basis is used to compute average daily balances for most of our financial instruments, including available for sale securities.  Fair value is used to compute average daily balances for our trading securities and financial instruments carried at fair value under the fair value option. 

MPF Loans held in portfolio that are on nonaccrual status are included in average daily balances used to determine the effective yield/rate.  Amounts included in interest income on MPF Loans held in portfolio are presented as detailed in   MPF Loans Held in Portfolio, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses   on page 46. 

Interest and effective yield/rate includes all components of net interest income as discussed above.  Yields/rates are calculated on an annualized basis. 

Any changes due to the combined volume/rate variance have been allocated ratably to volume and rate.

     Table of Contents  
  
  (Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated) 

Net interest income changed mainly due to the following: 

Interest income from investment securities declined primarily due to the decline in average investment balances as securities matured or paid down during the periods.  Although we are no longer required to obtain FHFA approval for any new investments that have a term to maturity in excess of 270 days, we are currently unable to make additional investments in MBS/ABS under FHFA regulatory limits as discussed in   Investments   on page 12 in our 2015 Form 10-K.  This decline in interest income was also negatively impacted by declines in accretion into interest income of expected improvements in future cash flows on securities that were previously charged with credit related OTTI.  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded accretion of   $11 million   compared to   $12 million   for the same period in 2015; and   $37 million   and   $41 million   for the comparable year to date periods ended September 30.  Accretion is dependent upon how estimated market conditions impact future cash flows, and may vary from past experience. 

Interest income from advances increased due to higher member demand for advances along with increases in interest rates, primarily as a result of the Federal Reserve Bank's actions at year end 2015. The key factor resulting in the increased demand for advances was the result of our continuing the Reduced Capitalization Advance Program (RCAP), which is designed to make the net cost of borrowing through advances more attractive to members by allowing members to borrow new advances using less activity based capital stock.  

Interest income from MPF Loans held in portfolio declined due to the decrease in our outstanding MPF Loans held in portfolio.  Though we have recently resumed purchasing MPF Loans, our purchases were not large enough to offset our loan paydown activity year over year.

     Table of Contents  
  
  (Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated) 

Interest income from other interest bearing assets comes primarily from interest bearing deposits, Federal Funds sold and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.  The increase is primarily due to increases in rates as a result of the Federal Reserve Bank's actions at year end 2015 to raise short term interest rates by 25 bps. 

Interest expense increased, primarily due to higher volume outstanding on our consolidated obligations used to fund the growth in our assets.  Rates overall on our consolidated obligations did not change materially during the periods presented.   

Our hedging activities also contributed a net reduction to net interest income.  The low interest rate environment resulted in negative net interest settlements on derivative contracts in active hedge accounting relationships.  For further details see   Trading Securities, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, and Instruments Held at Fair Value Option   in the following table. 

Non-Interest Gain (Loss)    

Trading Securities, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, and Instruments Held Under Fair Value Option 
    
  Gains or (losses) on these activities have generally stabilized in recent years primarily as a result of less volatile hedging costs, which is consistent with the hedging strategies for our more simplified balance sheet, along with a more stable economy. However, most of our total net effect from hedging activities was recorded as a component of net interest income, not in the above non-interest gain (loss) line items.  The low interest rate environment resulted in significant negative net interest settlements on derivative contracts.  Details are in the table on the following page. 

Litigation settlement awards 
    
  On October 15, 2010, we instituted litigation relating to   64   private-label MBS bonds we purchased in an aggregate original principal amount of   $4.29 billion  .  In April 2016, we received a payment of   $37.5 million   (partially offset by   $5.0 million   of related legal fees and expenses recorded in Noninterest expense) resulting from a settlement with some of the defendants.  We continue to pursue litigation related to these matters.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining litigation covers   four   private-label MBS bonds in the aggregate original principal amount of   $77.5 million  .  We cannot predict to what extent we will be successful in this remaining litigation.  See   Legal Proceedings   on page 60 for further details. 

Other gain (loss), net 
    
  Other gain (loss), net, consists primarily of income from the sale of MPF Loans to third party investors and fees other FHLBs pay us to support their participation in the MPF Program, which offsets a portion of the expenses we incur.

The following table shows the impact of Trading Securities, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, and Instruments Held Under Fair Value Option on our results of operations.  The largest contributor to the total net effect gain (loss) of hedging activities is net interest settlements.    Net interest settlements are attributable to open derivative hedging instruments and are included in the interest income/expense line item of the respective fair value or cash flow hedged item type.      The amortization/accretion amount pertains to both closed fair value and cash flow hedging adjustments, which are included in the interest income/expense line item of the respective hedged item type.

Noninterest Expense 

Compensation and benefits increased primarily due to defined benefit pension costs and other post retirement benefit related expenses (driven in part by the continued low interest rate environment and a change in the mortality tables used to calculate the estimated pension liability), and increased headcount and incentive compensation expenses.  We had   443   employees as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   410   as of   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Other consists of legal fees and expenses related to litigation settlements and costs related to our share of funding the Office of Finance and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 

Assessments 
    
  We fund the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) program at a calculated rate of 10% of income before assessments.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

Net unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities 
    
  Our available-for-sale portfolio securities are in a net unrealized gain position (net of any offsetting related fair value hedge losses) as market interest rates have declined since we acquired these securities. As these securities mature, the net unrealized gain position gradually reverses to zero as we will only collect the face value at their maturity.  Such reversals result in periodic net unrealized losses as individual securities mature.  Our unrealized net gain position related to our available-for-sale securities portfolio in AOCI was   $545 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Non-credit OTTI on held-to-maturity securities 
    
  We accrete the non-credit related OTTI amount in AOCI to the carrying amount of each related held-to-maturity security over its remaining life. The decrease in the periods presented resulted from a decline in our outstanding non-credit OTTI balance, which drove a reduction in the accretion amounts.  Our remaining non-credit OTTI amount on held-to-maturity securities in AOCI was   $(187) million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  We expect this remaining amount to continue to decline as our OTTI held-to-maturity securities approach maturity. 
    
  Net unrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges 
    
  Our cash flow hedges are more sensitive to changes in longer-term market interest rates than to changes in shorter-term market interest rates.  The net unrealized gains during 2016 resulted from an increase in interest rates compared to the beginning of the year, especially in the third quarter of 2016, offsetting losses recorded in earlier quarters when rates declined.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a net unrealized (loss) of   $(425) million   in AOCI related to our cash flow hedges. 
    
  Post-retirement plans 
    
  In the first quarter of 2015, we recorded an unrealized loss in OCI of $(8) million due to a revision to the mortality tables used for our post-retirement healthcare and supplemental defined benefit equalization plan. This loss is being amortized into compensation and benefits expense over the average number of years of employment remaining before retirement.  The annual amount of amortization is expected to be no more than $1 million.

Cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits, Federal Funds sold, and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
    
  Amounts held in these accounts will vary each day based on the following: 

Interest rate spreads between Federal Funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and our debt; 
                
    Liquidity requirements;

     Table of Contents

Advances 
    
  Advances increased in 2016 primarily due to our members' interest in the benefits we offer our members through our continuing Reduced Capitalization Advance Program (RCAP), which is designed to make the net cost of borrowing through advances more attractive to members and allows members to borrow new advances using less activity stock. 
    
  While our advances increased, it is possible that member demand for our advances could decline in future periods should their funding needs change, or to the extent they elect alternative funding resources.  In addition, as our advances with captive insurance companies mature, our total advance levels could decrease as further discussed in   Legislative and Regulatory Developments   on page 54 in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 

MPF Loans Held in Portfolio, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  We had a small net decrease in our outstanding MPF Loans from year end, as we resumed purchasing a higher volume of new loans during 2016 to help offset maturities and paydowns experienced in our MPF Loan portfolio.  In the third quarter of 2016, our purchases were slightly greater than our current loan paydowns in the quarter.  A portion of our new loans were refinancings, and this activity is dependent upon interest rates.  If rates were to rise significantly, our refinancings may decline. For the year to date period ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired   $759 million   in new MPF Loans to our portfolio, compared to   $117 million   in the same period in 2015.    
    
  In addition to our MPF Loans held in portfolio, we have MPF off-balance sheet products, where we buy and concurrently resell MPF Loans to Fannie Mae or other third party investors or pool and securitize them into Ginnie Mae MBS.

Liquidity, Funding,   Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity 
  For the period ending   September 30, 2016  , we have maintained a liquidity position in accordance with FHFA regulations and guidance, and policies established by our Board of Directors.  Based upon our excess liquidity position described below, we anticipate remaining in compliance with our liquidity requirements.  See   Liquidity, Funding,   Capital Resources   on page 48 in our 2015 Form 10-K for a detailed description of our liquidity requirements.  We use different measures of liquidity as follows: 
  Overnight Liquidity   Our policy requires us to maintain overnight liquid assets at least equal to 3.5% of total assets.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our overnight liquidity was   $9.0 billion   or   12%   of total assets, giving us an excess overnight liquidity of   $6.3 billion  . 
  Deposit Coverage   To support our member deposits, FHFA regulations require us to have an amount equal to the current deposits invested in obligations of the U.S. Government, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, or advances with maturities not exceeding five years.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had excess liquidity of   $43.7 billion   to support member deposits. 
    
  Contingency Liquidity   The cumulative five business day liquidity measurement assumes there is a localized credit crisis for all FHLBs where the FHLBs do not have the ability to issue new consolidated obligations or borrow unsecured funds from other sources (e.g., purchasing Federal Funds or customer deposits).  Our net liquidity in excess of our total uses and reserves over a cumulative five-business-day period was   $16.4 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In addition to the liquidity measures discussed above, FHFA guidance requires us to maintain daily liquidity through short-term investments in an amount at least equal to our anticipated cash outflows under two different scenarios. One scenario assumes that we cannot access the capital markets for 15 days and that during that time members do not renew any maturing, prepaid, and called advances. The second scenario assumes that we cannot access the capital markets for 5 days and that during that period we will automatically renew maturing and called advances for all members except for very large, highly rated members. These additional requirements are more stringent than the Contingency Liquidity requirement discussed above and are designed to enhance our protection against temporary disruptions in access to the FHLB debt markets in response to a rise in capital markets volatility. As a result of this guidance, we maintain increased balances in short-term investments. In addition, we fund certain overnight or shorter-term investments and advances with debt that has a maturity that extends beyond the maturities of the related investments or advances.  For a discussion of how this may impact our earnings, see page 22 in the   Risk Factors   section of our 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  We are sensitive to maintaining an appropriate liquidity and funding balance between our financial assets and liabilities, and we measure and monitor the risk of refunding such assets as liabilities mature (refunding risk).  In measuring the level of assets requiring refunding, we take into account their contractual maturities, as further described in the notes to the financial statements.  In addition, we make certain assumptions about their expected cash flows.  These assumptions include: calls for assets with such features, projected prepayments and scheduled amortizations for our MPF Loans held in portfolio, MBS and ABS investments.  The following table presents the unpaid principal balances of (1) MPF Loans held in portfolio, (2) AFS securities, and (3) HTM securities (including ABS and MBS investments), by expected principal cash flows. The table is illustrative of our assumptions about the expected cash flow of our assets, including prepayments made in advance of maturity. 

We consider our liabilities available to fund assets until their contractual maturity.  For further discussion of the liquidity risks related to our access to funding, see page 24 of the   Risk Factors   section in our 2015 Form 10-K.

Funding 
    
  Conditions in Financial Markets 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) delayed further interest rate hikes due to fragile economic growth and tepid inflation.  Market indicators suggest a 25 basis point interest rate hike in December 2016 by the FOMC, one year after its last rate increase.  The 10 year Treasury Note rose 13 basis points over the quarter ending at 1.60 percent. 
    
  We maintained ready access to funding during the quarter. 
    
  Cash flows from operating activities with significant changes 

Our operating assets and liabilities support our mission to provide our member shareholders competitively priced funding, a reasonable return on their investment in our capital stock, and support for community investment activities.  Operating assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by member-driven activities and market conditions.  We believe cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.  The   $(191) million   change in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities primarily resulted from the following: 

The non-cash adjustment attributable to the unrealized net changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments. 
       
  Cash flows from investing activities with significant changes 

Our investing activities predominantly include advances, MPF Loans held in portfolio, investment securities, and other 
  short-term interest-earning assets.  The   $(6.9) billion   change in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities primarily resulted from the following: 

The increase in net cash (used in) funding advances reflects our objective to make advances to our members our  
     primary business; 

48 

     Table of Contents  
  
  (Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated) 

The increase in net cash (used in) acquiring Federal Funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell reflects our objective to invest in liquid assets to meet the needs of our members; and 

The decrease in net cash (used in) purchasing MPF Loans Held in Portfolio reflects our decision in mid 2015 
      to resume these purchases. 

Cash flows from financing activities with significant changes 

Our financing activities primarily reflect cash flows related to issuing and repaying consolidated obligations.  The proceeds from the net increases in our consolidated obligation discount notes and consolidated obligations bonds were primarily utilized to fund the net increases in our investing activities as noted above.  The   $6.3 billion   change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities primarily resulted from the following: 

A net increase in our consolidated obligation debt outstanding, with a shift in funding from our consolidated obligation discount notes to consolidated obligation bonds; and  

The retirement of our subordinated notes.  

Capital Resources 
    
  Capital Rules 
    
  Under our Second Amended and Restated Capital Plan of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, effective October 1, 2015 (Capital Plan), our stock consists of two sub-classes of stock, Class B1 activity stock and Class B2 membership stock (together, Class B stock), both with a par value of $100 and redeemable on five years' written notice, subject to certain conditions.  Each member is required to own capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement or an activity stock requirement.  Class B1 activity stock is available for purchase only to support a member's activity stock requirement.  Class B2 membership stock is available to be purchased to support a member's membership stock requirement and any activity stock requirement. 
    
  Under our Capital Plan, our Board of Directors may set a threshold of between $10,000 and $75 million on the amount of Class B2 membership stock that would otherwise be held for membership if a member has advances outstanding that have an activity stock requirement in excess of the threshold amount.  In that case, the amount of Class B2 membership stock that exceeds such threshold and is necessary to support advance activity is automatically converted into Class B1 activity stock.  That threshold is currently set at $10,000, which means that we will convert to Class B1 activity capital stock any capital stock supporting advances that exceeds the lesser of the member's membership requirement or $10,000.   
    
  The Board of Directors may periodically adjust members' activity stock requirement for certain new advances within a range of 2% and 6% of a member's outstanding advances.  Our Board implemented this provision through RCAP as further discussed below.  In addition, our Board reduced each member's activity stock requirement from 5% to 4.5% for non-RCAP advances, effective April 1, 2016. 
    
  Our Capital Plan allows for an activity stock requirement for MPF Loans acquired for our portfolio within a range of 0% and 6%, which our Board has set at 0%. Should the Board decide to introduce this capital requirement, we intend to notify members sufficiently in advance of the change and apply that change only to future acquisitions.

The Board may periodically adjust members  membership stock requirement within a range of 0.20% to 2% of a member s mortgage assets.   In February 2016, our Board reduced the membership stock requirement to the greater of either $10,000 or 0.40% of a member's mortgage assets.  A member s investment in membership stock is subject to a cap equal to the lesser of (1) a dollar cap set by the Board within a range of $10,000 and $75 million, and (2) 9.9% of our total capital stock outstanding as of the prior December 31.  Also in February 2016 , the Board reduced the dollar cap on membership stock from $25 million to $5 million, which is less than 9.9% of the Bank s total capital stock at December 31, 2015, and thus the operative cap during the remainder of 2016 unless the Board sets a new cap. 
    
  Membership stock requirements will continue to be recalculated annually, whereas the activity stock requirement and any automatic conversion of Class B2 membership stock to Class B1 activity stock related to the threshold will apply on a daily basis.  The revised membership stock and activity stock requirements discussed above went into effect on April 1, 2016.  As a result of these changes, we held $593 million of excess capital stock on April 1, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, we held excess capital stock of   $419 million  .  The reduction was a result of members requesting repurchase of their excess stock and members utilizing excess stock to support new advance borrowing activities.  
    
  We may only redeem or repurchase capital stock from a member if, following the redemption or repurchase, the member continues to meet its minimum investment requirement and we remain in compliance with our regulatory capital requirements discussed below. 
    
  Members that withdraw from membership must wait at least five years after their membership was terminated and all of their capital stock was redeemed or repurchased before being readmitted to membership in any FHLB. 
    
  Under the terms of our Capital Plan, our Board of Directors is authorized to amend the Capital Plan, and the FHFA must approve all such amendments before they become effective. 
    
  Reduced Capitalization Advance Program 
    
  RCAP allows members to borrow one or more advances with an activity stock requirement of only 2% for the life of the advance instead of the 4.5% requirement under our Capital Plan s general provisions.  Since June 1, 2016, we have offered a more flexible version of RCAP, under which members can borrow both short- and long-term funding, including overnight advances, with the reduced activity stock capital requirement. 
  Capital Amounts 
    
  The following table reconciles our capital reported in our statements of condition to the amount of capital stock reported for regulatory purposes.  MRCS is included in the calculation of the regulatory capital and leverage ratios but is recorded in Other liabilities in our statements of condition. 

Although we have had   no   OTTI in   2016  , credit deterioration may negatively impact our remaining private-label MBS portfolio.  We believe that future impairments of this portfolio are possible if unemployment rates, default, delinquency, or loss rates on mortgages were to increase, or there is a further decline in residential real estate value.  We cannot predict if or when such impairments will occur, or the impact such impairments may have on our retained earnings and capital position.  See page 28 of the   Risk Factors   section of our 2015 Form 10-K.

We may not pay dividends if we fail to satisfy our minimum capital and liquidity requirements under the FHLB Act and FHFA regulations.  
    
  On October 27, 2016, our Board of Directors approved maintaining the dividend levels for the third quarter of 2016 and declared a 2.80% dividend (annualized) for Class B1 activity stock and a 0.60% dividend (annualized) for Class B2 membership stock based on our preliminary financial results for the third quarter of 2016. This dividend, including dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock, totaled   $11 million   and will be paid on November 14, 2016.  With this action, the Board continues the practice of rewarding members that use the Bank s advances and support the financial health of the entire cooperative.  Although we continue to work to maintain our financial strength to support a reasonable dividend, any future dividend determination by our Board will be at our Board's sole discretion and will depend on future operating results, our Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy and any other factors the Board determines to be relevant.  For further information about our Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy, see Retained Earnings and Dividend Policy on page 57 in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  We continue to allocate 20% of our net income each quarter to a restricted retained earnings account in accordance with the Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement that we entered into with the other FHLBs, as further discussed in   Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement   on page F-43 in our 2015 Form 10-K  . 
  The increase in MRCS and decrease in Capital Stock in the above table is mostly due to the transfer in the first quarter of 2016 of   $294 million   of our captive insurance company members' capital stock from equity to MRCS in liabilities on our statement of condition.  For further details see   Note 11 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS)   to the financial statements.

Risk Management - Credit Risk 
    
  Managing Our Credit Risk Exposure Related to Member Credit Products 
    
  Our credit risk rating system focuses primarily on our member's overall financial health and takes into account the member's asset quality, earnings, and capital position.  For further information please see   Member Credit Risk Ratings   on page 63 in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  The following table presents the number of members and related credit outstanding to them by credit risk rating.  Credit outstanding c  onsists primarily of outstanding advances and letters of credit.  MPF credit enhancement obligations, member derivative exposures, and other obligations make up the rest.    Of the total credit outstanding,   $42.8 billion   were advances (par value) and   $10.4 billion   were letters of credit at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $36.6 billion   and   $6.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . 

MPF Loans and Related Exposures 
    
  For details on our allowance for credit losses on MPF Loans, please see   Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses   to the financial statements. 
    
  Mortgage Repurchase Risk 
    
  We are exposed to mortgage repurchase risk in connection with our sale of MPF Loans to third party investors and MPF Loans securitized into MBS when a loan eligibility requirement or other warranty is breached.  We may require the PFI from which we purchased the ineligible MPF Loan to repurchase that loan from us or indemnify us for related losses.   
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we have repurchased   $2 million   and   $8 million   of unpaid principal balances related to MPF Loans.  Due to recoveries from PFIs, we incurred   no   material losses on these loans.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   $21 million   of unpaid principal with respect to mortgage loans that represent unresolved claims with investors in which a repurchase demand may occur, compared to $38 million at December 31, 2015.

Investment Securities 
    
  We hold a variety of investment securities, mostly government backed or insured securities such as GSE debt and FFELP ABS, and we believe these investments are low risk.  There was no material change in the credit ratings of these AA or better rated securities since   December 31, 2015  , and except for private-label MBS as noted below, we have never taken an impairment charge on these securities.  For further details see page 69 in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Our private-label MBS are predominantly variable rate securities rated below investment grade (BBB).  There was no material change in overall credit quality since   December 31, 2015  , nor have we acquired any new private-label MBS.  We last had an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) loss on private-label MBS in 2012.  We currently have unrealized gains on these securities as their market values have improved from the impaired values and subsequent to 2012 we have begun recording accretion gains on these securities back into income.  For further details see   Note 5 - Investments Securities   to the financial statements in this Form 10-Q as well as pages F-27 and F-28 in our 2015 Form 10-K.   

Unsecured Short-Term Investments Credit Exposure 
    
  For further details on our unsecured short-term investments as well as policies and procedures to limit and monitor our unsecured credit risk exposure, see page 72 in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  The following table presents the credit ratings of our unsecured investment credit exposures by the domicile of the counterparty or the domicile of the counterparty's parent for U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks.

Managing Our Credit Risk Exposure Related to Derivative Agreements 
    
  Refer to   Note 9 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities   to the financial statements for a discussion of how we manage our credit risk exposure related to derivative agreements.  We have credit exposure on net asset positions where we have not received adequate collateral from our counterparties.  We also have credit exposure on net liability positions where we have pledged collateral in excess of our liability to a counterparty. 
    
  The following table presents our derivative positions where we have such credit exposures.  The rating used was the lowest rating among the three largest Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations.  Non-cash collateral pledged consists of initial margin we posted through our FCMs, on behalf of the DCOs for cleared derivatives and is included in our derivative positions with credit exposure.

Legislative and Regulatory Developments  
    
  Significant regulatory actions and developments are summarized below. 
    
  Minority and Women Inclusion 
  On October 27, 2016, the FHFA proposed amendments to its Minority and Women Inclusion regulations that, if adopted, would clarify the scope of the FHLBs  obligation to promote diversity and ensure inclusion.  These proposed amendments update existing FHFA regulations aimed at promoting diversity and the inclusion and utilization of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities in all Bank business and activities, including management, employment and contracting.     
  The proposed amendments would: 
             
    require the FHLBs to develop standalone diversity and inclusion strategic plans or incorporate diversity and inclusion into their existing strategic planning processes and adopt strategies for promoting diversity and ensuring inclusion; 
                
    encourage the FHLBs to expand contracting opportunities for minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities through subcontracting arrangements; 
                
    require the FHLBs to amend their policies on equal opportunity in employment and contracting by adding sexual orientation, gender identity, and status as a parent to the list of protected classifications; and 
                
    require the FHLBs to provide information in their annual reports to the FHFA about their efforts to advance diversity and inclusion through capital market transactions, affordable housing and community investment programs, initiatives to improve access to mortgage credit, and strategies for promoting the diversity of supervisors and managers.  
       
  Comments on the proposed amendments are due by December 27, 2016. We are currently assessing the effect the proposed amendments would have on us if adopted. 
    
  FHLB Membership for Non-Federally-Insured Credit Unions 
    
  On September 28, 2016, the FHFA proposed amendments to regulations governing FHLB membership that would implement statutory amendments to the FHLB Act authorizing FHLBs to accept applications for membership from state-chartered credit unions without Federal share insurance, provided that certain prerequisites have been met. The new rule, if adopted, would generally treat these credit unions the same as other depository institutions with an additional requirement that they obtain an affirmative statement from their state regulator that they meet the requirements for Federal insurance as of the date of their application for FHLB membership; a written statement from the state regulator that it cannot or will not make any determination regarding eligibility for Federal insurance; or if the regulator fails or refuses to respond to the credit union s request within six months, confirmation of the failure to receive a response. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by November 28, 2016. We are currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule but do not anticipate that, if adopted, it would materially impact us.  
  Indemnification Payments 
    
  On September 20, 2016, the FHFA issued a re-proposed rule that, if adopted, would establish standards for identifying whether an indemnification payment by a FHLB or the Office of Finance to an officer, director, employee, or other entity-affiliated party in connection with an administrative proceeding or civil action instituted by the FHFA is prohibited or permissible. Under the proposed rule, those payments with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by the FHFA are only permitted if they relate to: 
             
    premiums for professional liability insurance or fidelity bonds for directors and officers, to the extent that the insurance or fidelity bond covers expenses and restitution, but not a judgment in favor of the FHFA or a civil money penalty; 
                
    expenses of defending an action, subject to an agreement to repay those expenses in certain instances; and 
                
    amounts due under an indemnification agreement entered into on or prior to September 20, 2016. 
       
  The proposed rule also outlines the process a board of directors must undertake prior to making any permitted indemnification payment for expenses of defending an action instituted by the FHFA. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by December 21, 2016. We are currently assessing the effect the proposed rule would have on us if adopted.

FRB Framework for Implementing the U.S. Basel III Countercyclical Capital Buffer   
    
  On September 8, 2016, the FRB adopted a final policy statement ( Policy Statement ) describing the framework that the FRB will follow in setting the countercyclical capital buffer ( CCyB ) for banking organizations that are subject to the advanced approaches capital rules, generally those with more than $250 billion in assets or $10 billion in on-balance-sheet foreign exposures, and to any depository institution subsidiary of such banking organizations. The CCyB supplements the minimum capital requirements and other capital buffers included in existing regulations, which were designed to provide resilience to unexpected losses created by normal fluctuations in economic and financial conditions.  
    
  Although the Policy Statement does not directly impact us, the potential impact on borrowings by our few larger members is uncertain.  
    
  FHLB New Business Activities 
    
  On August 23, 2016, the FHFA proposed a rule that, if adopted, would reduce the scope of new business activities ( NBAs ) for which a FHLB must seek approval from the FHFA and would establish more certain timelines for FHFA review and approval of NBA notices. The proposed rule also would clarify the protocol for FHFA review of NBAs. Under the proposed rule, acceptance of new types of legally permissible collateral by the FHLBs would not constitute a new business activity or require approval from the FHFA prior to acceptance. Instead, the FHFA would review new collateral types as part of the annual exam process.  
    
  On October 24, 2016, the FHLBs provided comments to the proposed rule, which primarily relate to certain procedures under the proposed rule. We do not anticipate that the proposed rule, if adopted, would materially impact us. 
  Mandatory Contractual Stay Requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts ( QFCs )    
    
  On August 19, 2016, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) issued a proposed rule, which, if adopted, would require certain systemically important financial institutions ( SIFI ) regulated by the OCC to amend their covered qualified financial contracts ( QFCs ) to limit a counterparty s immediate termination or exercise of default rights in the event of bankruptcy or receivership of the SIFI or an affiliate of the SIFI. Covered QFCs include derivatives, repurchase agreements (known as  repos ) and reverse repos, and securities lending and borrowing agreements. On May 3, 2016, the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ) issued a substantively identical proposed rule with respect to QFCs entered into with globally systemically important banking organizations ( GSIBs ) and their affiliates that are subject to regulation in the U.S. Further, on October 26, 2016, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") issued a substantively identical proposed rule with respect to QFCs entered into with certain FDIC-supervised institutions.  
    
  The FHLBs provided comments on the FRB proposed rule on August 5, 2016 and to the OCC proposed rule on October 18, 2016, which primarily seek clarification of an exemption and the recognition of a safe harbor. The FHLBs are considering whether to comment on the FDIC's proposed rule. We do not anticipate that the proposed rules, if adopted, would materially impact us. 
    
  European Union ( EU ) Market Abuse Regulation     
    
  The EU issued updated Market Abuse Regulations ( MAR ) that became effective July 3, 2016 which contain rules on insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information and market manipulation for debt and equity securities on European securities exchanges, which differ in certain respects from U.S. regulations. MAR applies to issuers with securities admitted to trading on the EU exchanges, including EU exchanges on which FHLB consolidated obligations are listed. MAR contains an exemption to its requirements for certain public bodies and central banks of third countries. The OF and the FHLBs are examining whether this exemption applies. If the exemption does not apply, we anticipate that the most significant impact of the MAR on us will be more stringent and detailed recordkeeping, creation of detailed lists on parties who have access to inside information, and notification requirements.  
    
  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) Rule 4210 establishing margin requirements for the TBA Market 
    
  On June 15, 2016, the SEC approved a proposed rule by FINRA to require the margining of certain  to-be-announced  ( TBA ) transactions. Specifically, the approved FINRA Rule 4210 will require FINRA members to collect from, but not post to, their customers maintenance margin (i.e. initial margin) and variation margin on transactions that are "Covered Transactions" (as defined in FINRA rules), subject to certain exemptions. Under the rule, we are exempt from posting initial margin but would be required to post variation margin to our FINRA-member counterparty in connection with covered transactions, provided we have more than $10 million in gross open positions with the counterparty. 
    
  FINRA members will be required to comply with the new margin requirements beginning in December 2017. We are currently assessing the financial and operational impacts of this rule.

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
    
  Measurement of Market Risk Exposure 
  To measure our exposure, we discount the cash flows generated from modeling the terms and conditions of all interest rate-sensitive securities using current interest rates to determine their fair values or spreads to the swap curve for securities where third party prices are used. This includes considering explicit and embedded options using a lattice model or Monte Carlo simulation. We estimate yield curve, option, and basis risk exposures by calculating the fair value change in relation to various parallel changes in interest rates, implied volatility, prepayment speeds, spreads to the swap curve and mortgage rates. 
    
  The table below summarizes our sensitivity to various interest rate risk exposures in terms of changes in market value. 

n/m 
    Spread movements to the swap curve within each category are independent of the other categories and therefore a total is not meaningful. 
       
  Yield curve risk     Change in market value for a one basis point parallel increase in the swap curve. 
  Option risk (implied volatility)     Change in market value for a one percent parallel increase in the swaption volatility. 
  Option risk (prepayment speeds)     Change in market value for a one percent increase in prepayment speeds. 
  Basis risk (spread to swap curve)     Change in market value for a one basis point parallel increase in the spread to the swap curve. 
  Basis risk (mortgage spread)     Change in market value for a one basis point increase in mortgage rates. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our sensitivity to changes in implied volatility was   zero  .  At   December 31, 2015  , our sensitivity to changes in implied volatility was   $(1) million  .  These sensitivities are limited in that they do not incorporate other risks, including but not limited to, non-parallel changes in yield curves, and basis risk related to differences between the swap and the other curves.  Option positions embedded in our mortgage assets and callable debt impact our yield curve risk profile, such that swap curve changes significantly greater than one basis point cannot be linearly interpolated from the table above.

  (Dollars in tables in millions except per share amounts unless otherwise indicated) 

Duration of equity is another measure to express interest rate sensitivity.  We report the results of our duration of equity calculations to the FHFA each quarter.  We measure duration of equity in a base case using the actual yield curve as of a specified date and then shock it with an instantaneous shift of the entire curve.  The following table presents the duration of equity reported by us to the FHFA in accordance with the FHFA's guidance, which prescribes that down and up interest-rate shocks equal 200 basis points. The results are shown in years of duration equity.   

Duration gap is another measure of interest rate sensitivity.  Duration gap is calculated by dividing the dollar duration of equity by the fair value of assets.  A positive duration gap indicates an exposure to rising interest rates.    As of September 30, 2016  , our duration gap was   0.9   months, compared to 0.5 months as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  As of September 30, 2016  , on a U.S. GAAP basis, our fair value surplus (relative to book value) was   $399 million  , and our market value of equity to book value of equity ratio was   108%  , compared to $351 million and 108% at   December 31, 2015  .  Our market to book value of total capital for regulatory risk-based capital purposes differs from this GAAP calculation,     as discussed in   Note 11 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS)   to the financial statements. 
  Our Asset/Liability Management Committee provides oversight of market risk management practices and policies.  This includes routine reporting to senior management and the Board of Directors, as well as maintaining the Income and Market Value Risk Policy, which defines our interest rate risk limits.  The table below reflects the change in market risk limits under the Income and Market Value Risk Policy.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date).  Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that information relating to us that is required to be disclosed in reports filed with the SEC (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  For the most recent quarter presented in this Form 10-Q, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Consolidated Obligations 
    
  Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures for accumulating and communicating information relating to our joint and several liability for the consolidated obligations of other FHLBs.  For further information, see   Item 9A. Controls and Procedures   on page 82 of our 2015 Form 10-K.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
    
  On October 15, 2010, the Bank instituted litigation relating to 64 private-label MBS bonds purchased by the Bank in an aggregate original principal amount of $4.29 billion.  Of the three cases that were filed by the Bank, only the action filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois remains active.  As of   September 30, 2016  , this litigation covers   four   private-label MBS bonds in the aggregate original principal amount of   $77.5 million  . 
  In this action, the Bank asserts claims for untrue or misleading statements in the sale of securities, signing or circulating securities documents that contained material misrepresentations, and negligent misrepresentation.  The Bank seeks the remedies of rescission, recovery of damages, and recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit.  As of September 30, 2016, Morgan Stanley   Co., Incorporated, and certain of its affiliates, remain as the sole defendants in the Illinois action. 
  The Bank may also be subject to various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.  After consultation with legal counsel, management is not aware of any other proceedings that might have a material effect on the Bank's financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
    
  In addition to the information presented in this report, readers should carefully consider the factors set forth in the   Risk Factors   section on page 19 in our 2015 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. These risks are not the only risks facing us.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also severely affect us.

Item 5. Other Information. 
    
  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) serves as the independent registered public accounting firm for us and the other FHLBs. Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (the Loan Rule) prohibits an accounting firm, such as PwC, from having certain financial relationships with their audit clients and affiliated entities. Specifically, the Loan Rule provides, in the relevant part, that an accounting firm generally would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a  record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client s equity securities.    
    
  PwC has advised the Bank that as of September 30, 2016 it has borrowing relationships with one Bank member (referred to below as the  Lender ) who owns more than ten percent of the Bank s capital stock, which could call into question PwC s independence with respect to the Bank.  The Bank is providing this disclosure to explain the facts and circumstances as well as PwC s and the Audit Committee s conclusions concerning PwC s objectivity and impartiality with respect to the audit of the Bank.   
    
  PwC advised the Audit Committee of the Bank that it believes that, in light of the facts of the borrowing relationship, its ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment on all matters encompassed within PwC s audit engagement have not been impaired and that a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same conclusion.  PwC has advised the Audit Committee that this conclusion is based in part on the following considerations: 

the borrowings are in good standing and the Lender does not have the right to take action against PwC, as borrower, in connection with the financings; 
                
    the debt balances outstanding are immaterial to PwC and to the Lender; 
                
    PwC has borrowing relationships with a diverse group of lenders, therefore PwC is not dependent on any single lender or group of lenders; and  
                
    the PwC audit engagement team has no involvement in PwC s treasury function and PwC s treasury function has no oversight or ability to influence the PwC audit engagement team. 
       
  Additionally, the Audit Committee of the Bank assessed PwC s ability to perform an objective and impartial audit, including consideration of the ownership and governance structure of the Bank, the limited voting rights of the Bank s members and the composition of the board of directors.  In addition to the above listed considerations, the Audit Committee considered the following: 

although the Lender owned more than ten percent of the Bank s capital stock, the voting power of the Lender's capital stock is less than ten percent;  
                
    no individual officer or director of a member or independent director that serves on the board of directors has the ability to significantly influence the Bank based on the composition of the board of directors; and 
                
    as of September 30, 2016, no officer or director of the Lender serves on the board of directors of the Bank. 
       
  Based on the Audit Committee s evaluation, the Audit Committee has concluded that PwC s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within PwC s audit engagement has not been impaired.  
    
  If in the future, however, PwC is ultimately determined under the Loan Rule not to be independent with respect to the Bank, or permanent relief regarding this matter is not granted by the SEC, the Bank may need to take other actions and incur other costs in order for the Bank s previously filed Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be deemed compliant with applicable securities laws. Such actions may include, among other things, obtaining a new audit of our historical financial statements by another independent registered public accounting firm. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on the Bank.   
    
  For further discussion of Bank members owning more than ten percent of the Bank s capital stock at September 30, 2016, please see   Note 11 - Capital and Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock (MRCS)   to the financial statements in this Form 10-Q.  For a discussion of the voting rights of our members, please see   Item 10 - Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance - 2015 Director Election   on page 84 in our 2015 Form 10-K.

MPF        CONSOLIDATED INTERBANK AGREEMENT 
  This MPF Consolidated Interbank Agreement is entered into this 22   nd    day of July, 2016, (the    Effective Date   ) by and among each of the Federal Home Loan Banks that execute this Agreement (each an    MPF Bank    and collectively the    MPF Banks   ) and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago in its capacity as the    MPF Provider   .  Each of the MPF Banks and the MPF Provider shall hereinafter be referred to as a    Party    and collectively the    Parties   . 
    RECITALS       
  WHEREAS, the MPF Program is a program under which MPF Banks purchase residential mortgage loans originated pursuant to the requirements of the Guides from PFIs; 
  WHEREAS, each MPF Bank has entered into a separate Services Agreement, with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, in its capacity as the MPF Provider;   
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks entered among themselves and with the MPF Provider into a Liquidity Option and Master Participation Agreement; 
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks also entered among themselves and with the MPF Provider into Servicing Transfer Agreements; 
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks desire to continue their participation in the MPF Program and to consolidate the MPF Agreements into this Agreement, to amend the provisions of the MPF Agreements in part and to transfer certain provisions of the MPF Agreements relating to operating and support procedures to the FHLB Guide, with the intention that this Agreement and the FHLB Guide supersede the MPF Agreements; and 
  WHEREAS, the MPF Banks intend that each Federal Home Loan Bank that desires to participate in the MPF Program become a Party to this Agreement. 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual promises and agreements herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as follows: 
  ARTICLE I.            DEFINITIONS 
  Section 1.1.        Certain Definitions  .  
  All capitalized terms used in this Agreement, which includes the recitals, shall have the meanings set forth in the Glossary of the FHLB Guide or in the Guides or as defined in this Agreement. In case of any conflict as to the meaning of a capitalized term, the definition in the Glossary of the FHLB Guide shall control. 
  ARTICLE II.        FHLB PARTICIPATION IN THE MPF PROGRAM 
  Section 2.1.        Participation in the MPF Program  .  
  
   Page   1   of 31 

Each Federal Home Loan Bank that executes this Agreement hereby agrees to participate in the MPF Program as an MPF Bank and to offer, at its election, Program Loan products to its PFIs under the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the FHLB Guide. 
  Section 2.2.        Applicability of Agreement  . 
  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the terms of this Agreement and the FHLB Guide shall apply to all prior, existing and future Program Loans, Master Commitments, Delivery Commitments, participation rights and obligations and any Servicing transfer rights and obligations unless specified otherwise. 
  Section 2.3.        FHLB Guide  . 
  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the terms of the FHLB Guide, as amended, restated, replaced or otherwise modified from time to time as specified in the FHLB Guide, are incorporated herein by reference and are made an integral part of this Agreement. 
  (a)        Amendments or Supplements  . The FHLB Guide may be amended or supplemented from time to time as follows: 
    
  (1)        Non-Substantive Revisions  .  Prior to issuing any non-Substantive Revisions to the FHLB Guide, the MPF Provider will consult with the Active MPF Banks after distributing a draft of the proposed non-Substantive Revisions to the Active MPF Banks for review. The MPF Provider will use commercially reasonable best efforts to balance differences of opinions among the Active MPF Banks, taking into account the direction or purpose of the overall MPF Program as established by the MPF Governance Committee, and abide by any additional obligation of the MPF Provider in determining whether and how to incorporate or address any comments from the Active MPF Banks concerning any non-Substantive Revisions.  Upon receipt of any draft non-Substantive Revisions to the FHLB Guide, the Active MPF Bank must respond within fifteen (15) Business Days unless a longer time for review and approval is allowed in the transmittal of the draft revisions, or otherwise approved by the MPF Provider in writing; provided, however, that non-Substantive Revisions which must be made to the FHLB Guide to comply with FHFA rules or regulations, third-party investors requirements, Applicable Law, or external matters beyond the control of the MPF Provider, may have a shorter review period, if needed to achieve compliance, but not less than two (2) Business Days (and, for the avoidance of doubt the MPF Provider shall be permitted to make any such revision notwithstanding whether the consent of the Active MPF Banks is obtained). An Active MPF Bank s review of draft FHLB Guide non-Substantive Revisions and opportunity to comment will be considered completed if there is no response from the Active MPF Bank within the time period specified herein, in the transmittal or otherwise specified in writing by the MPF Provider.  The MPF Provider may elect to publish the non-Substantive Revisions without additional review by the Active MPF Banks or, if the MPF Provider deems it appropriate, to provide the MPF Banks an additional review period.  Any comments sent by any MPF Bank after publication of any revisions to the FHLB Guide will be logged in by the MPF Provider and considered for inclusion when future revisions are made to the FHLB Guide. If an Active MPF Bank determines the proposed revision should be classified as a Substantive Revision, that Active MPF Bank must object to the non-Substantive Revision classification within two (2) Business Days from receipt of the proposed  
  
   Page   2   of 31 

revision. The MPF Provider shall then (i) request the Active MPF Banks to review the proposed revision as a Substantive Revision pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(2) or (ii) refer the proposed revision to the MPF Governance Committee for further action. If the MPF Provider elects a Substantive Revision review, two (2) Business Days will be deducted from the review time provided in Section 2.3(a)(2). 
    
    (2)        Substantive Revisions  .

Article and Section captions used in this Agreement are for convenience only, and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement. 
  Section 14.11.        Specific Performance  .   
  The Parties hereto recognize and agree that it may be impossible to measure in money the damages which will accrue to any Party hereto or its successors or assigns by reason of a failure to perform any of the obligations arising under this Agreement.

  Section 14.12.        Mediation of Disputes; Jurisdiction and Venue  .   
  (a)        No Party shall institute a proceeding before any tribunal to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (a    Dispute   ), before such Party has sought to resolve the dispute through mediation.  If the applicable Parties do not promptly agree on a mediator, any such Party may request the Director of the FHFA to appoint a mediator.  All mediation proceedings under this Agreement shall be held in Washington, D.C. or such other location as the applicable Parties may agree upon.  If the mediator is unable to facilitate a settlement of the Dispute within a reasonable time, as determined by the mediator, the  
  
   Page   27   of 31 

mediator shall issue a written statement to the applicable Parties to that effect and the complaining Party may then pursue any other remedy available to it at law or in equity.  The fees and expenses of the mediator shall be paid by the Party initiating mediation, unless the applicable Parties agree otherwise, but the paying Party shall be entitled to a judgment for reimbursement of such fees and expenses if it prevails against any other Party on all material issues in a judicial proceeding. 
  (b)        Each Party consents to the exercise of jurisdiction over its person and its property by any court of competent jurisdiction situated in the City of Chicago, State of Illinois (whether it be a court of the State of Illinois or a court of the United States of America situated in Illinois) for the enforcement of this Agreement or in any other controversy, dispute or question arising hereunder, and such Party waives any and all personal or other rights to object to such jurisdiction for such purposes.  Each Party, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives any objection which it may have to the laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding in any such court; provided, that the provisions of this paragraph shall not be deemed to preclude any other appropriate forum.  If such litigation is commenced at any time, the applicable Parties agree that service of process may be made, and personal jurisdiction over the other Party obtained, by service of a copy of the summons, complaint and other pleadings required to commence such litigation by United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed to such Party at its address for notices as provided in this Agreement.  The applicable Parties waive all claims of lack of effectiveness or error by reason of any such service. 
  Section 14.13.        No Joint and Several Liability; Necessary Parties  . 
  No Party to this Agreement shall be jointly and severally liable for any breach of any other Party under this Agreement. No Party to this Agreement shall be deemed a necessary party to any proceeding or litigation simply by reason of being a Party of this Agreement. The Parties agree that in the event of any dispute or disagreement among Parties relating to this Agreement that require any type of proceeding or litigation to resolve the dispute or disagreement, only the Parties among whom such dispute has arisen shall be made a party to any proceeding or litigation. 
  Section 14.14.        Amendment and Restatement 
  This Agreement amends, restates, replaces and supersedes in their entirety the MPF Agreements.  Each Party to this Agreement (a) agrees that all references to the MPF Agreements that are included in any other agreement or other document executed or delivered by any Party in connection with the MPF Program shall be deemed to be references to this Agreement, as amended from time to time, and (b) hereby amends all such MPF Agreements and other documents to the extent necessary or appropriate to reflect such changed references.   
  Section 14.15.        Equal Treatment of MPF Banks  .  
  
   Page   28   of 31 

The MPF Program is a cooperative program among the MPF Banks and the MPF Provider.  Consequently, the MPF Provider and each MPF Bank agree that any amendment or modification to this Agreement offered by or to any Active MPF Bank shall be promptly offered to all other Active MPF Banks.

           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluations; and 
       
           d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5.

           a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
