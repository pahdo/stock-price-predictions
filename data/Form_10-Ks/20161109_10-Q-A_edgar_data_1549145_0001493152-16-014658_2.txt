NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS DESCRIPTION   

Alliance
Bioenergy Plus, Inc (the  Company ) is a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy,
biofuels and new technologies sectors. From inception through December 5, 2014, the Company was known as Alliance Media Group
Holdings, Inc. At inception (March 28, 2012), the Company was organized as a vehicle to engage in the commercial production, distribution
and exploitation of Motion Pictures and other Entertainment products. However, in December 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, AMG Renewables, LLC ( AMG Renewables ), acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group,
LLC ( AMG Energy ), which owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC ( Carbolosic ), which
holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428)
known as  CTS  . The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material
into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company s goal in acquiring
the interest in AMG Energy is to develop the CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective
licensees. In September 2014, the Company determined to focus all of the Company s resources and personnel on the Company s
renewable energy holdings and future energy technologies and to divest the Company of its entertainment-related assets and subsidiaries.
The principal reason for such action was the recognition that the Company s entertainment-related assets were generating
substantial losses and contributing little value compared to the potential management saw in the energy-related activities and
to provide a clear focus and direction to the Company moving forward. The Company therefore determined at that time to divest
and sell off, close down or discontinue the operations of its entertainment-related subsidiaries. Subsequently, the Company determined
that the name Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. was no longer relevant to the new business direction of the Company and, effective
December 5, 2014, amended the Company s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Alliance Bioenergy
Plus, Inc., which is more appropriately descriptive of the new business direction of the Company.  

Plan
of Operation   

The
Company is focused on one industry   Renewable Energy. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AMG Renewables, LLC, which in
turn owns controlling interests in AMG Energy Group, LLC, and Ek Laboratories, Inc., the Company has a strategy that includes
growth in its energy-related activities as well as mergers and acquisitions and start-up activities which are focused on development
of an increasing revenue stream, secure market share and enhancement of shareholder value.  

AMG
RENEWABLES, LLC    

AMG
Renewables, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Renewables ), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
created for the purpose of managing and developing the Company s renewable energy technology enterprises. AMG Renewables
had one wholly-owned subsidiary, Carbolosic Plant 1, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( Carbolosic Plant 1 ),
and two majority owned subsidiaries, AMG Energy Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Energy ) and
Ek Laboratories, Inc., a Florida corporation ( EK ) formerly known as Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology,
Inc.  

On
    December 26, 2013, AMG Renewables acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group from certain related parties
    for a consideration comprising $2,200,000 cash and delivery of 7,266,000 shares of Company Common Stock. In connection with
    the transaction, an amount which the Company owed to AMG Energy ($214,894) for various loans and consulting fees was eliminated
    in the acquisition. On December 26, 2013, 7,000,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered to AMG Energy Solutions,
    Inc. (a related party) and the remaining 266,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered on June 18, 2014 to Wellington
    Asset Holdings, Inc. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has paid $168,742 of the $2,200,000 cash payable on account of this
    transaction, and as of such date, the Company has not paid the remaining amount, which amount has been recorded on the books
    of the Company as a related party payable relating to an acquisition.   

AMG
    Energy owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Carbolosic ),
    which holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428)
    known as  CTS  . The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material
    into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company s goal is to develop
    this CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective licensees.    

On
    May 13, 2015, AMG Energy entered into a series of agreements with various unrelated third parties, wherein AMG Energy sublicensed
    the CTS technology to Naldogen (Pty) Ltd., an existing South African company, which has been renamed Carbolosic Energy SA
    PTY LTD ( Carbolosic SA ). Carbolosic SA shall be solely devoted to exploitation of the CTS technology in South
    Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana and the term of the sublicense is coterminous with the master license (i.e. through
    July 1, 2032). The consideration for the grant of the sublicense is $25,000,000 ( License Fee ), which was to
    be paid or guaranteed by March 1, 2016. In addition to the license fee, the sublicense holder will pay AMG Energy a royalty
    of 3.5% of the revenues on the first CTS plant developed and a 5.0% royalty on the revenues of additional plants developed.
    Until the $25,000,000 payment has been received, the Company does not consider all of the events required under the agreement
    to have been completed. Therefore the Company has not recorded and of the fee in the accompanying financial statements.   

Contemporaneously,
    Carbolosic SA s shareholders entered into an agreement whereby, among other matters, it was agreed that ownership of
    Carbolosic SA shall be 43.5% for Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd, a South African company ( Tes ), 24.5 % for Spearhead
    Capital Ltd, a Seychelles company ( Spearhead ), 7.5% for Jupiter Trust, a South African Trust ( Jupiter )
    and 24.5% for Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. TES, Spearhead and Jupiter are all unrelated to the Company. The interests of
    Tes and Jupiter are delivered in consideration of the funding or guarantee of funding of the License Fee; Spearhead s
    interest is in consideration of facilitating the Sublicense transaction; and the Company s interest is in exchange for
    the delivery to Carbolosic SA of a 24.5% interest in one of the Company s CTS sugar extracting plants to be developed
    in the United States.   

In
    February 2016, due to economic and political turmoil in South Africa, members of Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd and Jupiter Trust
    resigned from management and from the Board of Carbolosic SA and returned all ownership interest in Carbolosic SA to the Carbolosic
    SA treasury. Spearhead Capital intends to continue operations of Carbolosic SA but at this time there is no guarantee that
    they will be successful in securing the needed funds or contracts to do so. The Company will evaluate its position in Africa
    in the coming months and decide on a path forward.   

Carbolosic
    Plant 1 was created in October 2014 for the purpose of being a full scale facility for converting cellulose material into
    sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing located in Palm Beach County, FL. In March
    2016, Carbolosic Plant 1 was sold to Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP, a non-related third party, in exchange for satisfaction of
    the outstanding $1,250,000 loan and accrued interest between Carbolosic Plant 1 and Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP.    

EK,
    was created in December 2014 under the name Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology, Inc. and changed its name
    to Ek Laboratories, Inc. on June 05, 2015. EK was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMG Energy, to serve as a demonstration
    and research facility to further develop the CTS process, its uses, and develop new technologies.    

The
Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the bio-fuels, renewable energy and chemical
manufacturing industries. As of the date of filing, the Company has not generated any revenues from its renewable energy business.  

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern, which assumes the Company will realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated any revenue, has incurred losses since inception,
has a working capital deficiency of $1,936,451 and may be unable to raise further equity. At June 30, 2016 the Company had incurred
accumulated losses of $19,189,898 since its inception. The Company expects to incur significant additional liabilities in connection
with its start-up activities. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient revenues
from its operations to pay its operating expenses. These Financial Statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability
and classifications of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
There are no assurances that the Company will continue as a going concern.  

Management
believes that the Company s future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations, generate cash
from operating activities and obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient
cash from operations, sell additional shares of stock or borrow additional funds. The Company s inability to obtain additional
cash could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, and its ability to continue in existence.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty  

The
Company intends to raise additional capital, sell licenses to its CTS technology and continue constructing its full scale demonstration
facility which, once operational, is expected to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to cover the Company s operating
expenses and debt service.  

Through
its private offerings, the Company raised $3,730,390 from inception through December 31, 2015 and raised an additional $2,216,994
in the six months ended June 30, 2016.  

NOTE
3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company s majority-owned
subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. Intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, after elimination of
intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in business entities in which the Company lacks control but has the ability
to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method. The Company s
proportionate share of net income or loss of the entity is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the dates presented and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented.
Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates of impairment
assessment of identifiable intangible assets and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Estimates are based on past experience
and other considerations reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

All
highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.  

Stock
Compensation   

The
Company recognizes the cost of all share-based payments under the relevant authoritative accounting guidance. Share-based payments
include any remuneration paid by the Company in shares of the Company s common stock or financial instruments that grant
the recipient the right to acquire shares of the Company s common stock. For share-based payments to employees, which consist
only of awards made under the stock option plan described below, the Company accounts for the payments in accordance with the
provisions of ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation  (formerly referred to as SFAS No. 123(R)). Share-based payments
to consultants, service providers and other non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 718, ASC Topic 505,  Equity
Payments to Non-Employees  or other applicable authoritative guidance.  

Stock-based
Compensation Valuation Methodology   

Stock-based
compensation resulting from the issuance of common stock is calculated by reference to the valuation of the stock on the date
of issuance, the expense being recognized as the compensation is earned. Stock-based compensation expenses related to employee
options and warrants granted to non-employees are recognized as the stock options and warrants are earned. The fair value of the
stock options or warrants granted is estimated at the grant date, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the expense
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the life of the
option or warrant. The grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments is estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model on the basis of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the measurement date, adjusted for the unique
characteristics of those equity instruments, using the assumptions noted in the table below. The fair value of the common stock
is determined by the then-prevailing closing market price. Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company s
closing day market price per share. The expected term of options and warrants was based upon the life of the option, and the risk-free
rate used was based on the U.S. Treasury Daily Yield Curve Rate.  

The
stock compensation issued for services during the six months ended June 30, 2016, was valued on the date of issuance. The following
assumptions were used in calculations of the Black-Scholes option pricing models for warrant-based stock compensation issued in
the six months ended June 30, 2016:  

Accounting
and Reporting of Discontinued Operations   

As
required by the FASB ASC Subtopic 205.20, per ASU 2014-08, Discontinued Operations, a component of an entity or a group of components
of an entity, or a business or nonprofit activity can be classified as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic
shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results when any of the following occurs:
(i) the criteria in paragraph 205.20.45.1E to be classified as held for sale is met (ii) the component is disposed of by sale,
or (iii) the component is disposed of other than by sale in accordance with paragraph 360.10.45.15 (for example, by abandonment
or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff). Certain components to be disposed of other than by sale shall continue to be classified
as  held and used  until it is disposed of, per the requirements of ASC Subtopic 360.10. Depreciation on these assets
ceases upon their classification as  held and used.  The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-08 effective September 1, 2014.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis over the
useful lives of the assets, generally 5 to 7 years. Expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance
are expensed as incurred.  

Convertible
Instruments    

The
Company evaluates and account for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives
and Hedging Activities .  

Applicable
GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative
financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics
and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks
of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate
instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.  

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when we have determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) as follows: The Company records when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic
value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common
stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under
these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption.  

Common
Stock Purchase Warrants and Other Derivative Financial Instruments   

The
Company classifies as equity any contracts that require physical settlement or net-share settlement or provide it with a choice
of net-cash settlement or settlement in the Company s own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) provided
that such contracts are indexed to its own stock as defined in ASC 815-40 ( Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ).
The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net
cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the Company s control) or give the counterparty
a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company assesses the
classification of its common stock purchase warrants and other free-standing derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether
a change in classification between assets and liabilities is required.  

Non-controlling
interest in consolidated subsidiaries   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. and those subsidiaries that
the Company has the ability to control either through voting rights or means other than voting rights. For these subsidiaries,
the Company records 100% of the revenues, expenses, cash flows, assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements.
For subsidiaries that the Company controls but hold less than 100% ownership, a non-controlling interest is recorded in the consolidated
income statement to reflect the non-controlling interest s share of the net income (loss), and a non-controlling interest
is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet to reflect the non-controlling interest s share of the net assets of the subsidiary.  

Investments
in non-consolidated affiliates   

Investments
in non-consolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and/or
the Company s ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. When
the equity method is used, investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize the Company s
proportionate share of the investees  net income or losses after the date of investment. When net losses from an investment
are accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying amount, the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional
losses are not provided for. The Company resumes accounting for the investment under the equity method if the entity subsequently
reports net income and the Company s share of that net income exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the
period the equity method was suspended. Investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value
that is other than temporary has occurred.  

The
Company s investment in Carbolosic, LLC is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company monitors its
investment for impairment at least annually and make appropriate reductions in the carrying value if it determines that an impairment
charge is required based on qualitative and quantitative information.  

Impairment
of Long Lived Assets    

Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group
may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable,
the Company compares the carrying amount of the asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows, excluding interest costs, expected
to be generated by the asset group and their ultimate disposition. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the
carrying value, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds
the fair value of the asset group. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less
costs to sell.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes. 
Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and
(ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s
financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available
positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  

ASC
Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a
tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions
for any of the reporting periods presented.  

Profit
(Loss) per Common Share:   

Basic
profit (loss) per share amounts have been calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each
reporting period. Diluted loss per share has been calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares plus the potentially
dilutive effect of securities such as outstanding options and warrants. The computation of potential common shares has been performed
using the treasury stock method. The warrants and options are antidilutive for all periods presented. When net loss is reported,
diluted and basic net loss per share amounts are the same as the impact of potential common shares is antidilutive.  

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value
as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair
value measurements.  

The
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, payables to related parties, and accounts payable and accrued expenses
are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.  

ASC
820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may
be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  

Level
2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable  

Level
3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on
its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows when implemented.

Business
Overview   

Alliance
Bioenergy Plus, Inc (the  Company ) is a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy,
biofuels and new technologies sectors. From inception through December 5, 2014, the Company was known as Alliance Media Group
Holdings, Inc. At inception (March 28, 2012), the Company was organized as a vehicle to engage in the commercial production, distribution
and exploitation of Motion Pictures and other Entertainment products. However, in December 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, AMG Renewables, LLC ( AMG Renewables ), acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group,
LLC ( AMG Energy ), which owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC ( Carbolosic ), which
holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428)
known as  CTS  . The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material
into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company s goal in acquiring
the interest in AMG Energy is to develop the CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective
licensees. In September 2014, the Company determined to focus all of the Company s resources and personnel on the Company s
renewable energy holdings and future energy technologies and to divest the Company of its entertainment-related assets and subsidiaries.
The principal reason for such action was the recognition that the Company s entertainment-related assets were generating
substantial losses and contributing little value compared to the potential management saw in the energy-related activities and
to provide a clear focus and direction to the Company moving forward. The Company therefore determined at that time to divest
and sell off, close down or discontinue the operations of its entertainment-related subsidiaries. Subsequently, the Company determined
that the name Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. was no longer relevant to the new business direction of the Company and, effective
December 5, 2014, amended the Company s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Alliance Bioenergy
Plus, Inc., which is more appropriately descriptive of the new business direction of the Company.  

Plan
of Operation   

The
Company is focused on one industry   Renewable Energy. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AMG Renewables, LLC, which in
turn owns controlling interests in AMG Energy Group, LLC, and EK Laboratories, Inc., the Company has a strategy that includes
growth in its energy-related activities as well as mergers and acquisitions and start-up activities which are focused on development
of an increasing revenue stream, secure market share and enhancement of shareholder value.  

AMG
RENEWABLES, LLC    

AMG
Renewables, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Renewables ), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
created for the purpose of managing and developing the Company s renewable energy technology enterprises. AMG Renewables
has two majority owned subsidiaries, AMG Energy Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ( AMG Energy ) and
Ek Laboratories, Inc, a Florida corporation ( EK ).  

On
    December 26, 2013, AMG Renewables acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group from certain related parties
    for a consideration comprising $2,200,000 cash and delivery of 7,266,000 shares of Company Common Stock. In connection with
    the transaction, an amount which the Company owed to AMG Energy ($214,894) for various loans and consulting fees was eliminated
    in the acquisition. On December 26, 2013, 7,000,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered to AMG Energy Solutions,
    Inc. (a related party) and the remaining 266,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered on June 18, 2014 to Wellington
    Asset Holdings, Inc. As of the date of filing, the Company has paid $168,742 of the $2,200,000 cash payable on account of
    this transaction, and as of such date, has not yet paid the remaining amount, which amount has been recorded on the books
    of the Company as a related party payable relating to an acquisition.   

Carbolosic
    Plant 1, LLC was created in October 2014 as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMG Renewables for the purpose of being a full scale
    facility for converting cellulose material into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing.
    In March 2016, Carbolosic Plant 1 was sold to Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP, a non-related third party, in exchange for satisfaction
    of the outstanding $1,250,000 loan and $36,488 interest between Carbolosic Plant 1 and Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP. In connection
    with the transaction, an amount which the Company had prepaid to Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP ($122,879) for future marketing
    and interest was eliminated in the sale.   

AMG
    Energy owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Carbolosic ),
    which holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428)
    known as  CTS  . The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material
    into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company s goal is to develop
    this CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective licensees.   

On
    May 13, 2015, AMG Energy entered into a series of agreements with various unrelated third parties, wherein AMG Energy sublicensed
    the CTS technology to Naldogen (Pty) Ltd., an existing South African company, which will be renamed Carbolosic Energy SA PTY
    LTD ( Carbolosic SA ). Carbolosic SA shall be solely devoted to exploitation of the CTS technology in South Africa,
    Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana and the term of the sublicense is coterminous with the master license (i.e. through July 1,
    2032). The consideration for the grant of the sublicense is $25,000,000 ( License Fee ), which was to be paid
    or guaranteed by March 1, 2016. In addition to the license fee, the sublicense holder will pay AMG Energy a royalty of 3.5%
    of the revenues on the first CTS plant developed and a 5.0% royalty on the revenues of additional plants developed. Until
    the $25,000,000 payment has been received, the Company does not consider all of the events required under the agreement to
    have been completed. Therefore the Company has not recorded and of the fee in the accompanying financial statements.   

Contemporaneously,
    Carbolosic SA s shareholders entered into an agreement whereby, among other matters, it was agreed that ownership of
    Carbolosic SA shall be 43.5% for Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd, a South African company ( Tes ), 24.5 % for Spearhead
    Capital Ltd, a Seychelles company ( Spearhead ), 7.5% for Jupiter Trust, a South African Trust ( Jupiter )
    and 24.5% for Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. TES, Spearhead and Jupiter are all unrelated to the Company. The interests of
    Tes and Jupiter are delivered in consideration of the funding or guarantee of funding of the License Fee; Spearhead s
    interest is in consideration of facilitating the Sublicense transaction; and the Company s interest is in exchange for
    the delivery to Carbolosic SA of a 24.5% interest in one of the Company s CTS sugar extracting plants to be developed
    in the United States.   

In
    February 2016, due to economic and political turmoil in South Africa, members of Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd and Jupiter Trust
    resigned from management and from the Board of Carbolosic SA and returned all ownership interest in Carbolosic SA to the Carbolosic
    SA treasury. Spearhead Capital intends to continue operations of Carbolosic SA but at this time there is no guarantee that
    they will be successful in securing the needed funds or contracts to do so. The Company will evaluate its position in Africa
    in the coming months and decide on a path forward.   

On
    July 29, 2015, Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. (the  Company ) entered into two agreements with Renewable Resources
    Development of America, LLC ( RRDA ) related to the development of facilities by RRDA in North and South America
    which will utilize the Company s Cellulose to Sugar ( CTS ) technology. RRDA is engaged in construction
    and finance of facilities for municipal solid waste recovery and plastics, metals and paper recycling, chemical extraction
    from ore for manufacturing and cellulose material conversion into sugars for manufacture of bio-fuels, bio-plastics and other
    products. In connection with its business plan, RRDA is developing facilities using cellulose conversion technology.   

In
    this regard, the Company and RRDA entered into a Non-Exclusive Development Agreement ( Development Agreement )
    pursuant to which RRDA will utilize the CTS technology in the plants it develops. Under the Development Agreement, the Company
    would license its intellectual property to RRDA and provide certain consulting and educational services to RRDA. The specific
    terms of the license have yet to be determined. It is currently RRDA s plan to develop up to 56 plants.   

In
    addition, the Company and RRDA simultaneously entered into a Finance Agreement ( Finance Agreement ) pursuant
    to which the Company would receive $4 million cash in exchange for the following: (a) RRDA shall receive a number of shares
    of Company Common Stock such that at the closing of the financing RRDA would own ten percent (10%) of the number of issued
    and outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company; (b) RRDA would receive a Warrant to purchase two (2) million shares
    of Company Common Stock on terms to be agreed; (c) the license fee payable to the Company on account of the first plant being
    developed by RRDA in Georgia would be waived and (d) RRDA will designate two (2) persons to be appointed to the Company s
    Board of Directors.   

In
    March 2016, the Company canceled the Finance Agreement with RRDA due to a lack of funding in a timely manner. The Development
    Agreement remains in effect and any opportunities brought to the Company under this agreement will be subject to the same
    terms and conditions as any other license opportunity, including the proposed plant in Vidalia, Georgia.   

EK,
    was created in December 2014 under the name Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology, Inc. and changed its name
    to Ek Laboratories, Inc. on June 05, 2015. EK was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMG Energy, to serve as a demonstration
    and research facility to further develop the CTS process, its uses, and develop new technologies.    

The
Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the bio-fuels, renewable energy and chemical
manufacturing industries. As of this date, the Company has not generated any revenues from its renewable energy business.  

Capital
Formation   

From
January 1, 2016 through the date of filing, the Company has issued 1,260,000 shares of Company common stock for services valued
at $532,050.   

From
January 1, 2016 through the date of filing, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,700,000 warrants for services. Using a Black-Scholes
asset pricing model, these warrants were valued at $954,193. These warrant agreements have terms of five years (5) with exercise
prices ranging from forty-five cents ($0.45) to two dollars ($2.00) per share.  

From
January 1, 2016 through the date of filing, the Company issued options to its independent directors to purchase an aggregate of
65,228 shares of common stock for a period of three (3) years at an average exercise price of $0.45. In addition, the Company
also approved employee stock options to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at an average exercise price of $0.35 and a five
year (5) term. In addition, 333,334 options became fully vested during the period. Using a Black-Scholes asset pricing model,
these agreements were valued at $200,720.  

In
November 2015, the Company commenced a new offering of units valued at eight-five (85%) percent of the average of the last three
days closing market share price. Each unit consists of one (1) share of common stock, one (1) three-year Series C warrant convertible
to .5 common share at an exercise price of $0.45 and one (1) three-year series D warrant convertible to .5 common share at an
exercise price of $0.65. From January 1, 2016 through the date of filing, the company has sold 500,000 units for aggregate proceeds
of $89,000. The offering is ongoing.  

In
January 2016, the Company commenced a new offering of units valued at $0.24 per share. Each unit consist of one (1) share of common
stock and one (1) five-year Series E warrant convertible to one (1) common share at an exercise price of $0.45. As of the date
of filing, the Company has sold 3,085,517 units for aggregate proceeds of $740,524. The offering is ongoing.   

In
March 2016, the Company commenced a new offering of units valued at $765,735. Each unit consists of three million seven hundred
seventeen thousand seven hundred eighty-five (3,717,785) shares of common stock and four million five hundred thousand (4,500,000)
five-year series F warrants convertible to one (1) share of common stock each at an exercise price of $0.25. As of the date of
filing, the Company has sold 2 units totaling 7,435,570 shares of common stock and 9,000,000 warrants for aggregate proceeds of
$1,531,470.  

From
January 1, 2016 through the date of filing, $115,000 of the Company s convertible debt converted to 1,048,460 shares of
common stock. The company assesses the value of the beneficial conversion feature of its convertible debt by determining the intrinsic
value of such conversions, under ASC 470, at the time of issuance. At the time of issuance of the convertible debt instruments
set out above, the fair value of the stock was greater than the conversion price, and therefore a total value of $218,301 was
attributed to the beneficial conversion feature.  

In
April 2016, the Company issued 1,388,886 warrants to acquire a convertible note. Each warrant is convertible into one (1) share
of common stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share or the lowest trade price in the preceding 10 trading days. The term on
these warrants is 5 years. Using a Black-Sholes asset pricing model, the warrants were valued at $471,303.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company has incurred losses since inception, has a working capital deficiency, and may be unable to raise further equity. At June
30, 2016 the Company had a working capital deficiency of $1,936,451 and had incurred accumulated losses of $19,189,898 since its
inception. The Company expects to incur significant additional losses in connection with its continued start-up activities. As
a result, the report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm on the Company s financial statements
for the period ended December 31, 2015 contains an emphasis of matter paragraph regarding the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern based upon recurring operating losses and its need to obtain additional financing to sustain operations. The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet
its obligations and repay its liabilities when they become due and to generate sufficient revenues from its operations to pay
its operating expenses. Furthermore, these Financial Statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and
classifications of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.  

Through
its private offerings, the Company raised $1,162,209 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and an additional $2,216,994 in the
six months ended June 30, 2016.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of the period ended June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2015     

For
the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company s general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $721,288
to $1,461,881 from $740,593 in the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase is primarily the result of a $507,869 increase
in loan fees, $73,917 increase in payroll and 119,662 increase in professional fees. Of the $1,461,881 general and administrative
expense, approximately 62% or $911,775 is non-cash equity compensation.  

During
the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company s general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $983,657
to $2,743,504 from $1,759,847 in the six months ended June 30, 2015. This increase is primarily the result of a $588,217 increase
in loan fees and a $411,592 increase in professional fees, while simultaneously decreasing payroll by $76,699. Of the $2,743,504
general and administrative expense, approximately 61% or $1,675,764 is non-cash equity compensation.  

Interest
expense increased in the three months ended June 30, 2016 by approximately $39,294 to $56,441 from $17,147 during the three months
ended June 30, 2015. The increase was the result of a convertible note received in April 2016.  

During
the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company s interest expense increased by approximately $453,306 to $485,426 from
$32,120 during the six months ended June 30, 2015. This increase is the result of 10 notes having been repaid, with early payment
penalties, during the six months ended June 30 2016 and zero notes repaid during the six months ended June 30, 2015.  

For
the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company s equity loss in its unconsolidated affiliates decreased $337 to $42,347
from $42,684 during the three months ended June 30, 2015.  

During
the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company s equity loss in its unconsolidated affiliate increased $1,403 to $83,677
from $82,274 during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase is primarily attributed to the addition of the 24.5% ownership
interest in Carbolosic SA.  

The
Company s discontinued operations showed a gain of $73 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to a $7,377 loss
incurred in the three months ended June 30, 2015. This gain was the result of a utility refund received during the period. During
the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company s discontinued operations decreased $25,893 to 3,125 from $29,018 during
the six months ended June 30, 2015. These amounts are the result of the Company s decision in September 2014 to divest the
Company of its entertainment-related assets and subsidiaries and to focus all of the Company s resources and personnel on
the Company s renewable energy holdings and future energy technologies.  

Research
and development (R D) expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $2,897 as opposed to $18,463 for the three months
ended June 30, 2015 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016, R D expenses were $7,131 as opposed to $18,463 during the
six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in R D expenses is the result of the opening of Ek Laboratories, Inc. in June
2015 and its initial bulk purchases of gasses and other fine grade materials used in the CTS process.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity   

As
of June 30, 2016 the Company had $105,842 in cash and total stockholders  equity was $6,638,079. Total debt from continuing
operations, including advances, accounts payable and other notes payable at June 30, 2016, together with interest payable thereon,
was $3,107,376 a decrease of $1,989,306 from $5,096,682 at December 31, 2015. This decrease is attributable to the satisfaction
of $1,250,000 in long term debt, the repayment of $1,264,000 in convertible debt and the recent addition of a $555,556 convertible
note.  

During
the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company s continuing operating activities used $1,412,959 in cash. This use can
be attributed to the sale of Carbolosic Plant 1 which resulted in an aggregate net amount of $1,163,609.  

During
the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company s investing activities used $170,204 in cash, which $94,662 was advanced
to Carbolosic, LLC mainly for payment of the minimum annual royalty and $58,476 was used towards capitalized engineering and development
plans.  

During
the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company generated $1,630,076 through its financing activities. This can primarily be attributed
to the retirement of $884,000 in convertible debt and $265,000 in notes payable, while simultaneously raising $2,216,994 through
its ongoing offerings and securing $555,556 in convertible debt.  

Capital
Resources   

At
this time, the Company has limited liquidity and capital resources. To continue funding the Company s operations, the company
will need to generate revenue and/or will require additional funding for ongoing operations and to finance such projects it may
identify. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has raised $2,216,994 in addition to $3,730,390 raised through December 31, 2015 for
a total of $5,947,384 through its private placement offerings. However, there is no guarantee that the company will be able to
raise any additional capital on terms acceptable to the Company.  

The
inability to obtain this funding either in the near term and/or longer term will materially affect the ability of the Company
to implement its business plan of operations and jeopardize the viability of the Company. In that case, the Company may need to
reevaluate and revise its operations.

accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information set forth in Regulation S-X and include the assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses of the Company s majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. Intercompany
transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been
included. Operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the year ending December 31, 2016 or any other period. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes
thereto for the period ended December 31, 2015.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
Company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, after elimination
of intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in business entities in which the Company lacks control but has the ability
to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method. The Company s
proportionate share of net income or loss of the entity is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the dates presented and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented.
Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates of impairment
assessment of identifiable intangible assets and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Estimates are based on past experience
and other considerations reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

Stock
Compensation   

The
Company recognizes the cost of all share-based payments under the relevant authoritative accounting guidance. Share-based payments
include any remuneration paid by the Company in shares of the Company s common stock or financial instruments that grant
the recipient the right to acquire shares of the Company s common stock. For share-based payments to employees, which consist
only of awards made under the stock option plan described below, the Company accounts for the payments in accordance with the
provisions of ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation  (formerly referred to as SFAS No. 123(R)). Share-based payments
to consultants, service providers and other non-employees are accounted for under in accordance with ASC Topic 718, ASC Topic
505,  Equity Payments to Non-Employees  or other applicable authoritative guidance  

Convertible
Instruments    

The
Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives
and Hedging Activities .  

Applicable
GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative
financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics
and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks
of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate
instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.  

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when we have determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) as follows: The Company records when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic
value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common
stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under
these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
that may have an impact on the Company s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future either will not have an impact on
its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows when implemented.  

In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this
Update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification,
thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from GAAP.
In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information
in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development
stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose
in the first year in which the entity is no longer in a development stage that in prior years it had been in the development stage.  

The
amendments also clarify that the guidance in Topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties, is applicable to entities that have not commenced
planned principal operations. Finally, the amendments remove paragraph 810-10-15-16. Paragraph 810-10-15-16 states that a development
stage entity does not meet the condition in paragraph 810-10-15-14(a) to be a variable interest entity if (1) the entity can demonstrate
that the equity invested in the legal entity is sufficient to permit it to finance the activities that it is currently engaged
in and (2) the entity s governing documents and contractual arrangements allow additional equity investments. The amendments
in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining
whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments
to eliminate that exception simplify GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance
of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting
entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements
for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of
inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except
for the clarification to Topic 275, which shall be applied prospectively. For public business entities, those amendments are effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early application of each of the
amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity s financial statements have
not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Upon adoption, entities will no
longer present or disclose any information required by Topic 915. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-10 effective July 31, 2014.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that is material to investors.  

Seasonality   

The
Company s operating results are not affected by seasonality.  

Inflation   

The
Company s business and operating results are not affected in any material way by inflation.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this report, have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to reasonably ensure that material information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Rules and forms and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The principal basis for this conclusion is the lack of segregation of duties within
our financial function and the lack of an operating Audit Committee.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM
1.       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

The
Company is subject, from time to time, to litigation, claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date
of filing, the only material litigation, claims or suits whose outcomes could have a material effect on the Company s financial
statements are as follows:  

Creative
Licensing Litigation .   

During
2013, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, AMG Television, LLC ( AMG Television ), had entered into agreements
(collectively, the  Creative Licensing Agreement ) to acquire (i) the partially completed American Idol style reality
series World Star (formerly Recreating A Legend) for a $600,000 cash payment plus 1,600,000 shares of Company Common Stock and
(ii) the completed documentary Making of a Saint: The Journey to Sainthood for a $100,000 cash payment plus 267,000 shares of
Company Common Stock. Subsequently, on April 25, 2014, the Company and AMG Television notified the sellers that it was rescinding
both transactions due to a breach of the Creative Licensing Agreement in that the sellers misled AMG Television regarding the
status and ownership of the rights and failed to provide agreed documentation required in order to permit exploitation of the
projects. In the legal action filed in the Circuit Court of the 15th Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach County Florida (Alliance Media
Group Holdings, Inc. and AMG Television, LLC v. Creative Licensing International, LLC, et. al. case no. 502014CA005033XXXXMBAF),
the Company and AMG Television allege that Creative Licensing International, LLC and 28 individual defendants (including Roy A.
Sciacca and Lisa Colletti) breached the Creative Licensing Agreement and fraudulently induced AMG Television to enter into the
Creative Licensing Agreement. The Company and AMG Television amended their complaint in the matter on May 14, 2014. The Company
and AMG Television are seeking the rescission of the Creative Licensing Agreement, return of the Company stock issued and cash
delivered in connection therewith and other and further damages suffered by the Company in an amount to be determined at the time
of trial. As of December 31, 2014, The Company and AMG Television had reached settlements (the  Settlement ) with
seven of the twenty-eight named defendants and the Company had canceled a net of 116,872 shares of common stock which have been
tendered to the Company. In February 2015, the Company reached a settlement of the case with respect to the principal defendants,
Roy A. Sciacca and Lisa Colletti whereby Sciacca and Colletti agreed to return an aggregate of 960,215 shares of previously issued
stock to the Company and the Company agreed to issue 500,000 new shares of stock to them. In connection with the Settlement with
Sciacca and Colletti, the Company has recovered a net of 497,555 shares issued in connection with the Creative Licensing transaction.
In the aggregate, the Company has now recovered 614,424 of the 1.867 million shares issued in connection with the transaction.
In addition, in connection with the Settlement, the Company recovered an additional 500,000 of the 800,000 shares of Company stock
which had been previously issued in connection with payment for purported management services to be provided by certain of the
defendants. The Company continues to believe that its position in the litigation is well-taken and supported by the facts and
will continue to proceed with respect to the remaining defendants. The litigation is in its early stages and the Company cannot
project whether it will achieve a successful result in connection with the remainder of the action or any other related actions.
Discovery has yet to be commenced and no trial date has been set. If the matter is taken to conclusion, the Company could incur
additional legal expenses in an amount which cannot be determined or estimated at this time.  

Other
than the aforementioned matter, there are no other legal proceedings which are pending or have been threatened against the Company
or any of its officers, directors or control persons of which management is aware.
