NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

Organization  

FutureFuel Corp. (  FutureFuel ), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, FutureFuel Chemical Company ( FutureFuel Chemical ), owns and operates a chemical production facility located on approximately 2,200 acres of land six miles southeast of Batesville in north central Arkansas fronting the White River (the  Batesville Plant ). FutureFuel Chemical manufactures diversified chemical products, biobased products comprised of biofuels, and biobased specialty chemical products. FutureFuel Chemical s operations are reported in two segments: chemicals and biofuels.  

The chemicals segment manufactures a diversified listing of chemical products that are sold to  third party customers. The majority of the revenues from the chemicals segment are derived from the custom manufacturing of specialty chemicals for specific customers.  

The biofuels business segment primarily produces and sells biodiesel. FutureFuel Chem ical also sells petrodiesel in blends with the company s biodiesel and, from time to time, with no biodiesel added. Finally, FutureFuel is a shipper of refined petroleum products on common carrier pipelines and buys and sells petroleum products to maintain an active shipper status on these pipelines.  

Basis    of   Presentation   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by FutureFuel in accordance and consistent with the accounting policies stated in FutureFuel  s 2015 audited consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2015 audited consolidated financial statements of FutureFuel.  

In the opinion of FutureFuel, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been included in th e unaudited consolidated financial statements. The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10-Q adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements, and do include amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. Future actual results could differ from such current estimates. The unaudited consolidated financial statements include assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of FutureFuel and its wholly owned subsidiaries; namely, FutureFuel Chemical Company, FFC Grain, L.L.C., FutureFuel Warehouse Company, L.L.C., and Legacy Regional Transport, L.L.C. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

INVENTORY  

The carrying values of inventory were as follows as of:    

FutureFuel recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of $1,8 77 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This lower of cost or market adjustment was recorded as a decrease in inventory values and an increase in cost of goods sold. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the lower of cost or market adjustment was $192  .

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  

FutureFuel is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. Commodity pric e risk is the primary risk managed by using derivative instruments. Regulated fixed price futures and option contracts are utilized to manage the price risk associated with future purchases of feedstock used in FutureFuel s biodiesel production along with physical feedstock and finished product inventories attributed to this process.  

FutureFuel recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet. FutureFuel  s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific guidelines of ASC 815-20-25,  Derivatives   and   Hedging . None of the derivative instruments are designated and accounted for as hedges primarily as a result of the extensive record keeping requirements.  

The fair value of FutureFuel  s derivative instruments is determined based on the closing prices of the derivative instruments on relevant commodity exchanges at the end of an accounting period. Realized gains and losses on derivative instruments and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as a component of cost of goods sold, and amounted to gains of $803 and $6  ,456 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and losses of $5  ,375 and gains of $4,119 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    

The volumes and carrying values of FutureFuel  s derivative instruments were as follows at:  

The margin account maintained with a broker to collateralize these derivative instruments  carried an account balance of $4,232   and $225 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is classified as other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The carrying values of the margin account and of the derivative instruments are included net, in other current assets.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES  

At  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, FutureFuel had investments in certain preferred stock, trust preferred securities, exchange traded debt instruments, and other equity instruments. These investments are classified as current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. FutureFuel has designated these securities as being available-for-sale. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of stockholders  equity.  

FutureFuel  s marketable securities were comprised of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

The aggregate fair value of instruments with unrealized losses totaled $ 14  ,887 and $15,571 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, FutureFuel had no investments in marketable securities that were in an unrealized loss position for a greater than 12-month period.

BORROWINGS  

On April 16, 2015, FutureFuel, with FutureFuel Chemical as the borrower, and certain of FutureFuel  s other subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a $150,000 secured and committed credit facility with the lenders party thereto, Regions Bank as administrative agent and collateral agent, and PNC Bank, N.A., as syndication agent. On May 25, 2016, FutureFuel increased the credit facility by $15,000. The credit facility consists of a five-year revolving credit facility in a dollar amount of up to $165,000, which includes a sublimit of $30,000 for letters of credit and $15,000 for swingline loans (collectively, the  Credit Facility ).  

The interest rate floats at the following margins over LIBOR or base rate based upon the leverage ratio from time to time: 

The terms of the Credit Facility contain certain covenants and conditions including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum liquidity requirement. FutureFuel was in compliance with such cove nants as of September 30, 2016.  

There were no borrowings under this credit agreement at  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  

The following table summarizes the provision for income taxes.

The effective tax rate for the three and  nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflects our expected tax rate on reported operating earnings before income tax. Our effective tax rate in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflects the positive effect of the reinstatement of certain tax credits and incentives for 2016.  In 2016, it is anticipated that these tax credits and incentives will form a larger proportion of FutureFuel s net income than in prior years. This increase in proportion combined with the income tax treatment of the credits and incentives will reduce FutureFuel s effective income tax rate in 2016 relative to prior years. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FutureFuel booked a tax benefit related to the reversal of a state s treatment of the taxability of the tax credits and incentives.    

The effective tax rate for the three and  nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflects our expected tax rate on reported operating income earnings before income tax. Our effective tax rate in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflects the positive effect of the completion of an IRS audit of FutureFuel s 2010 through 2012 amended federal income tax returns which allowed FutureFuel to successfully recover tax benefits previously unrecorded in its financial statements. Also, during the second quarter of 2015, FutureFuel recorded the unfavorable tax effect related to a state subjecting the tax credits and incentives to taxation. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the tax credits and incentives along with its favorable tax treatment was not in effect.  

Unrecognized tax benefits totaled $2,060  and $4,588 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

FutureFuel records interest and penalties, net, as a component of income tax expense.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, FutureFuel recorded $189 and $61, respectively, in accruals for interest or tax penalties  .

EARNINGS PER SHARE  

We compute earnings per share using the two-class method in accordance with  ASC Topic No. 260,  Earnings per Share.  The two-class method is an allocation of earnings between the holders of common stock and a company s participating security holders. Our outstanding non-vested shares of restricted stock contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and, therefore, are considered participating securities for purposes of computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. We had no other participating securities at September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

Contingently issuable shares associated with outstanding service-based restricted stock units were not included in the earnings per share calculations for the three-month periods ended  September 30, 2016 or 2015 as the vesting conditions had not been satisfied.  

Basic and diluted earnings per common share were computed as follows:

  (Dollars    in   thousands,   except   per   share   amounts)   

  (Unaudited)  

Certain options to purchase FutureFuel  s common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three-months and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 because they were anti-dilutive in the period. The weighted average number of options excluded on this basis was 30,000 and 76  ,667 for the three-months and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The weighted average number of options excluded on this basis was 190,000 and 130,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015, respectively  .  

9    )   

SEGMENT INFORMATION  

FutureFuel has two reportable segments organized along similar product groups    chemicals and biofuels.  

Chemicals  

FutureFuel  s chemicals segment manufactures diversified chemical products that are sold externally to third party customers. This segment is comprised of two components:  custom manufacturing  (manufacturing chemicals for specific customers) and  performance chemicals  (multi-customer specialty chemicals).  

Biofuels  

FutureFuel  s biofuels business segment primarily manufactures and markets biodiesel. Biodiesel revenues are generated through the sale of biodiesel to customers through FutureFuel s distribution network at the Batesville Plant, through distribution facilities available at leased oil storage facilities, and through a network of remotely located tanks. Biofuels revenues also include the sale of biodiesel blends with petrodiesel, petrodiesel with no biodiesel added, RINs, biodiesel production byproducts, and the purchase and sale of other petroleum products on common carrier pipelines.  

Summary    of long-lived   assets   and   revenues   by   geographic area   

All of FutureFuel  s long-lived assets are located in the U.S.  

Most of FutureFuel  s sales are transacted with title passing at the time of shipment from the Batesville Plant, although some sales are transacted with title passing at the delivery point. While many of FutureFuel s chemicals are utilized to manufacture products that are shipped, further processed, and/or consumed throughout the world, the chemical products, with limited exceptions, generally leave the United States only after ownership has transferred from FutureFuel to the customer. FutureFuel is rarely the exporter of record, never the importer of record into foreign countries, and is not always aware of the exact quantities of its products that are moved into foreign markets by its customers. FutureFuel does track the addresses of its customers for invoicing purposes and uses this address to determine whether a particular sale is within or outside the United States. FutureFuel s revenues attributable to the United States and foreign countries (based upon the billing addresses of its customers) were as follows:   

Revenues from a single foreign country during the three-months and  nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 did not exceed 1% of total revenues.    

9 

Summary of    business   by   segment   

Depreciation is allocated to segment costs of goods sold  based on plant usage. The total assets and capital expenditures of FutureFuel have not been allocated to individual segments as large portions of these assets are shared to varying degrees by each segment, causing such an allocation to be of little value.  

10    )   

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   

Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Fair val ue accounting pronouncements also include a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of FutureFuel. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect FutureFuel s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

From time to time, FutureFuel and its  operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations, regulatory matters, and proceedings, which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While FutureFuel is unable to predict the outcomes of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

In April of 2015, FutureFuel acquired additional historical line space on a pipeline for $1,408. The acquired line space was recorded as an intangible asset with an indefinite life as there was no foreseeable limit on the time period over which it is expe cted to contribute to cash flows. The carrying value of the asset was $1,408 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. FutureFuel will test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with codification ASC 350-30-35-18 through 35-20.  

15    )   

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STATEMENTS   

In May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued new principles-based accounting guidance for revenue recognition that will supersede virtually all existing revenue  guidance. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve the core principle, the guidance establishes the following five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligation in the contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The guidance also details the accounting treatment for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. Lastly, disclosure requirements have been enhanced to provide sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The provisions of the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) are to be applied retrospectively; early adoption prior to the original effective date is not permitted. However, in May 2016, FASB and International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued amended guidance clarifying adoption, the retrospective application, and delay of the effective date by one year. FutureFuel is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial position, results of operations, and related disclosures.  

In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the   FASB ) issued new guidance that requires inventory not measured using either the last in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard will be effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016 and will be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. FutureFuel is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial position, results of operations, and related disclosures.  

In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance under the simplification and productivity initiative for presentation of deferred income tax liabilities and assets. This guidance simpl ifies the presentation of deferred income taxes such that deferred tax liabilities and assets are to be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The update does not amend the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period and may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company has elected not to early adopt the new guidance as of the balance sheet date due to the insignificance of the change. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the impact to the company would be a reclassification of $4,080 and $7,060, respectively, from current deferred tax liability to long-term deferred tax liability.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on lease accounting. The new guidance establishes two types of leases for lessees: finance or operating. The guidance for lessors is largely unchanged. Under the guidance, a lessee is to recognize  a right-of-use asset and lease liability that arises from a lease. A lessee can make a policy election, by asset class, to not recognize lease assets or liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Both finance and operating leases will have associated right-of-use assets and liabilities initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. Current and noncurrent balance sheet classification will apply. Finance leases will have another reported element for interest associated with the principal lease liability. The component concept from the 2014 revenue recognition standard has been included in the new lease standard which will guide identification of individual assets and non-lease components. As with current GAAP, the guidance does not apply to the following leases: intangible assets to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas, and similar nonregenerative resources, biological assets (includes timber), inventory, or assets under construction. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted. The new guidance is to be applied under a modified retrospective approach wherein practical expedients have been allowed that will not require reassessment of current leases at the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations and related disclosures.  

In March 2016, the FASB issued guidan ce in regards to stock compensation as a part of the simplification initiative that covers related tax accounting, cash flow presentation, and forfeitures. The two tax accounting related amendments are as follows: all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, the tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur, an entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period; and the threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. The cash flow presentation items sets forth that excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity and cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. For forfeitures, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new guidance application is mixed among the various elements that include, retrospective, prospective, and modified retrospective transition methods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations and related disclosures.  

During June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to credit losses. The new guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with an expected credit loss methodology and requires consideration of a broader range of information to determine credit loss estimates. Financial assets measured at amortized cost will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected by using an allowance for credit losses. Purchased credit deteriorated loans will receive an allowance account for expected credit losses at the acquisition date that represents a component of the purchase price allocation. Credit losses relating to available for sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for expected credit losses, with such allowance limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. An allowance will be established for estimated credit losses on held to maturity securities. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the Company  s financial position and results of operations and related disclosures.  

In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance to reduce existing diversity in practice in regards to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance specifically addresses the following items: debt  prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interest in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The new guidance is to be applied retrospectively to each period presented at the date of adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact on the Company s related disclosures.

  Certain    tables   may   not   add   due   to rounding.   

The following Management  s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, set forth herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See  Forward Looking Information  below for additional discussion regarding risks associated with forward-looking statements.  

Overview  

Our company is managed and reported in two reporting segments: chemicals segment and biofuels segment. Within the chemicals segment are two product grou pings: custom chemicals and performance chemicals. The custom product group is comprised of specialty chemicals manufactured for a single customer whereas the performance product group is comprised of chemicals manufactured for multiple customers. The biofuels segment is comprised of one product group. Management believes that the diversity of each segment strengthens the company in the ability to utilize resources and is committed to growing each segment.  

Summary    of   Financial   Results   

Set forth below is  a summary of certain consolidated financial information for the periods indicated.   

14 

We use adjusted EBITDA as a key operating metric to measure both performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not a substitute for operating income, net income, or  cash flow from operating activities (each as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses, excluding, when applicable, non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, public offering expenses, acquisition-related transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments, losses on disposal of property and equipment, gains or losses on derivative instruments, and other non-operating income or expenses. Information relating to adjusted EBITDA is provided so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing the overall operation and liquidity of our business. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies; therefore, the results of our calculation are not necessarily comparable to the results of other companies.  

Adjusted EBITDA allows our chief operating decision makers to assess the performance and liquidity of our business on a consolidated basis to assess the ability of our operating segments to  produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, to fund capital expenditures and to pay dividends. In particular, our management believes that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance and liquidity, relative to a performance and liquidity based on GAAP results, while isolating the effects of certain items, including depreciation and amortization, which may vary among our operating segments without any correlation to their underlying operating performance, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense that varies widely among similar companies, and gains and losses on derivative instruments, which can cause net income to appear volatile from period to period relative to the sale of the underlying physical product.  

We enter into commodity derivative instruments primarily to protect our operations from downward movements in commodity prices, and to provide greater certainty of cash flows associated with sales of our commodities. We enter  into hedges, and we utilize mark-to-market accounting to account for these instruments. Thus, our results in any given period can be impacted, and sometimes significantly, by changes in market prices relative to our contract price along with the timing of the valuation change in the derivative instruments relative to the sale of biofuel. We include this item as an adjustment as we believe it provides a relevant indicator of the underlying performance of our business in a given period.  

The following table  reconciles adjusted EBITDA with net income, the most directly comparable GAAP performance financial measure.

Results    of   Operations      

Consolidated  

Consolidated sales revenue in the three and  nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $37  ,748 and $81  ,919, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. These decreases were primarily from lower sales of pipeline business in the biofuels segment.  In addition, the chemical segment experienced lower sales volume and prices.  Partially offsetting these decreases were increased sales volumes of biodiesel and biodiesel blends in the biofuel segment.  

Gross profit in the three and  nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $1  ,644   and $1,811, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase primarily resulted from the reinstatement of the blenders  tax credit (BTC) on December 31, 2015 and to a lesser extent, the adjustment in the carrying value of our inventory as determined utilizing the LIFO method of inventory accounting.  The LIFO adjustment reduced gross profit $413 and $2,187 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The LIFO adjustment increased gross profit $1  ,845 and $1,137 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Partially offsetting these increases was lower sales volumes in the chemicals segment.  

Operating    Expenses   

Operating expenses  decreased $264   and $48, in the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three and nine-months ended 2015, respectively. The decrease in the three month comparison was from reduced compensation for general and administrative personnel and outside legal and administrative fees with no significant changes in the nine month period.   

Provision    for Income   Taxes   

The effective tax rate for the three and  nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflects our expected tax rate on reported operating earnings before income tax. Our effective tax rate in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, reflects the positive effect of the reinstatement of the certain tax credits and incentives for 2016.  In 2016, it is anticipated that the tax credits and incentives will form a larger proportion of FutureFuel s net income than in prior years. This increase in proportion combined with the income tax treatment of the tax credits and incentives will reduce FutureFuel s effective income tax rate in 2016 relative to prior years. In addition, during 2016, FutureFuel booked a tax benefit related to the reversal of a state s treatment of the taxability of the tax credits and incentives.    

The effective tax rate for the three and  nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflects our expected tax rate on reported operating income earnings before income tax. Our effective tax rate in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, reflects the positive effect of the completion of an IRS audit of FutureFuel s 2010 through 2012 amended federal income tax returns which allowed FutureFuel to successfully recover tax benefits previously unrecorded in its financial statements. Also during the second quarter of 2015, FutureFuel recorded the unfavorable tax effect related to a state subjecting the tax credits and incentives to taxation. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the tax credits and incentives along with its favorable tax treatment was not in effect.  

Net    Income   

Net income for the three months  ended September 30, 2016 increased 165% or $8,018   as compared to the same period in 2015. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 125% or $20  ,887 as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase for both the three and nine month periods was from: i) the benefit of tax credits and incentives in effect resulting in an income tax benefit in the three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 which was not in effect in the three and nine   months ended September 30, 2015; ii) the benefit of the EPA s final rule on the Renewable Fuel Standard; and iii) the favorable reversal of a state s previous tax treatment of tax credits and incentives.

Chemicals    Segment   

Sales revenue in the three months ended  September 30, 2016 declined by $7  ,308 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Sales revenue for our custom chemicals (unique chemicals produced for specific customers) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $20  ,455, a decline of $6  ,210 from the comparable period in 2015. This decline was primarily attributed to continued lower sales volumes of chemicals used in the agrochemical and energy markets and to a lesser extent, lower sales volumes of the laundry detergent additive. Further impacting revenue was reduced selling prices in accordance with contractual agreements indexed to key raw materials. Performance chemicals (comprised of multi-customer products which are sold based on specification) sales revenues were $3  ,844 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1,098 from the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily from timing of product shipments to customers.  

Sales revenue in the  nine months ended September 30, 2016 declined by $24  ,571 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Sales revenue for our custom chemicals (unique chemicals produced for specific customers) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $60  ,148, a decline of $24  ,473 from the comparable period in 2015. This decline was primarily attributed to continued lower sales volumes of chemicals sold to customers servicing the agrochemical and energy markets and to a lesser extent, reduced sales volumes of the laundry detergent additive. Further impacting revenue was reduced selling prices in accordance with contractual agreements indexed to certain key raw materials. Performance chemicals (comprised of multi-customer products which are sold based on specification) sales revenues were $13  ,782 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a slight decrease of $98 from the nine months ended September   30, 2015  .   

Gross profit for the chemicals segment for the three months ended  September 30, 2016 increased by $559 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profits were increased by the change in adjustments in the carrying value of our inventory as determined utilizing the LIFO method of inventory accounting. This adjustment decreased gross profit $77 and $853 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The changes in the LIFO adjustment and product mix primarily resulted in a 32% decline in cost of goods sold and distribution expense as compared to a 23% decline in revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Gross profit for the chemicals segment for the  nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $5,437 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease resulted primarily from lower sales volumes of the laundry detergent additive and reduced volume from other custom products used in the agrochemical and energy markets.  Gross profits were benefited by the change in adjustments in the carrying value of our inventory  as determined utilizing the LIFO method of inventory accounting. This adjustment increased gross profit $946 and $189 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   The net result of all changes was a 27% decline in cost of goods sold and distribution expense as compared to a 25% decline in revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Biofuels    Segment   

Biofuels sales revenue in the three months ended  September 30, 2016 decreased $30  ,440 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily from the reduction in pipeline sales which totaled $1  ,509 and $27  ,689 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, sales volumes of  biodiesel and biodiesel blends increased 6% but were more than offset by lower average selling prices.   Total sales from biodiesel and biodiesel blends decreased $4  ,260  .   

Biofuel sales revenue in the  nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $57  ,348 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily from lower sales of pipeline business in the biofuels segment. Pipeline sales totaled $7  ,390   and $59  ,232   in the nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, sales volumes in the biodiesel and biodiesel blends increased 19% but were more than offset by lower average selling prices. Total sales from   biodiesel and biodiesel blends decreased $5  ,506  .

Revenues from common carrier pipelines varies as its revenue recognition depends upon whether a transaction is bought from and sold to the same party. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are ent ered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell agreements) are combined and recorded on a net basis. Additionally, revenue from common carrier pipelines fluctuates with market conditions.  

A portion of our biodiesel sold in 2016 and 2015 wa s to a major refiner in the United States and no assurances can be given that we will continue to sell to such major refiner, or, if we do sell, the volume we will sell or the profit margin we will realize. We do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our biofuels segment or on us as a whole in that: (i) unlike our custom manufacturing products, biodiesel is a commodity with a large potential customer base; (ii) we believe that we could readily sell our biodiesel to other customers as potential demand from other customers for biodiesel exceeds our production capacity; (iii) our sales to this customer are not under fixed terms and the customer has no fixed obligation to purchase any minimum quantities except as stipulated by short term purchase orders; and (iv) the prices we receive from this customer are based upon then-market rates, as would be the case with sales of this commodity to other customers.  

Biofuels gross profit in the three months ended  September 30, 2016 increased $1  ,085 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of goods sold declined quarter over quarter 43% as compared to a decline of 40% in sales revenue for the same periods. Gross profits were benefited by the change in adjustments in the carrying value of our inventory as determined utilizing the LIFO method of inventory accounting. The LIFO adjustment decreased gross profit $336 and $1,326 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The segment was further impacted by a lower of cost or market adjustment of $1,877   and $192 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  .  

Biofuels gross profit in the  nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $7  ,248  .  Cost of goods sold declined 38% as compared to a decline of 34% in sales revenue for the same period. Gross profit was primarily benefited with the BTC and the final rule on the Renewable Fuel Standard from the EPA in place throughout the year when neither was in effect in the same period of 2015.  The segment was impacted by a lower of cost or market adjustment of $1,877 and $192 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

Biofuels gross profit was reduced by the change in activity from  derivative instruments. Gains on derivative instruments were $803 and $6,456 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Losses on derivative instruments were $5  ,375 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and gains were $4,119 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In order to better manage the commodity price risk caused by market fluctuations in biofuel prices, we may enter into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts. We account for these derivative instruments in accordance with accounting standards whereby the fair value of FutureFuel s derivative instruments is determined based on the closing prices of the derivative instruments on relevant commodity exchanges at the end of an accounting period. Realized gains and losses on derivative instruments and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recorded in the statement of operations as a component of cost of goods sold within the biofuels segment.  

FutureFuel recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet. FutureFuel  s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific guidelines of ASC 815 -20-25,  Derivatives   and   Hedging . None of the derivative instruments are designated and accounted for as hedges due primarily to the extensive record keeping requirements.  

The volumes and carrying values of FutureFuel  s derivative instruments were as follows:  

*All derivative instruments are entered into with the standard contract terms and conditions in accordance with major trading authorities of the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

Critical    Accounting     Estimates   

Revenue    Recognition   

For most product sales, revenue is recognized when product is shipped from our facilities and risk of loss and title have passed to the customer, which is in accordance with our customer contracts and the stated shipping terms. Nearly  all custom manufactured products are manufactured under written contracts. Performance chemicals and biodiesel are generally sold pursuant to the terms of written purchase orders. In general, customers do not have any rights of return, except for quality disputes. All of our products are tested for quality before shipment, and historically returns have been inconsequential. We do not offer rebates or other warranties.  

Revenue from bill and hold transactions in which a performance obligation exists is rec ognized when the total performance obligation has been met and title to the product has transferred. Bill and hold transactions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were related to specialty chemicals customers whereby revenue was recognized in accordance with contractual agreements based upon product being produced and ready for use. These sales were subject to written monthly purchase orders with agreement that production was reasonable. The inventory was custom manufactured and stored at the customer s request and could not be sold to another buyer. Credit and payment terms for bill and hold customers are similar to other specialty chemicals customers. Sales revenue under bill and hold arrangements were $6,759 and $8,134 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $17  ,103   and $23,350  , for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Liquidity    and   Capital   Resources   

Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities , and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are set forth in the following chart.  

(Dollars in thousands)    

Operating    Activities   

Cash from operating activities increased from $ 59,922   of cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2015 to $76  ,879   of cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the change in our net income offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and income tax receivable. In the first nine months of 2016, net income increased cash provided by operating activities by $37  ,865 as compared to $16  ,774 in the first nine months of 2015.  This difference was primarily from the change in the provision for income taxes in 2015 as compared to the benefit of income taxes in 2016.  Cash from the change in accounts receivable, including accounts receivable   from related parties, increased cash provided by operating activities by $16,312 in the first nine months of 2016, a reduction from the increase of cash of $31,508 in the first nine months of 2015.  

18 

Investing    Activities   

Cash used in investing activities was $ 40  ,444   in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $1  ,628 provided in the first nine months of 2015. This change was primarily the result of net sales or purchases of marketable securities in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. In the first nine months of 2016, such net purchases totaled $33  ,328. In the first nine months of 2015, such net sales totaled $12,897   but were offset by $6,029 from cash used in capital expenditures and $3,832 used to collateralize derivative instruments.  Our capital expenditures and customer reimbursements for capital expenditures are summarized in the following table:    

(Dollars in thousands)    

Financing Activities  

Cash used in financing activities decreased  slightly from $9,082   in the first nine months of 2015 to $8  ,111   in the first nine months of 2016. This change is primarily the result of payments for deferred financing costs in the first nine months of 2015. The payment of dividends totaled $7,869   and $7,870   in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Credit    Facility   

Effective April 16, 2015, we entered into a new $150 million secured committed credit facility with a syndicated group of commercial banks. On May 25, 2016, we increased the facility  $15,000. The loan is a revolving facility, the proceeds of which may be used for our working capital, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes. The facility terminates on April 16, 2020. See Note 6    Borrowings  in our consolidated financial statements ended September 30, 2016 for additional information regarding our Credit Agreement.  

We intend to fund future capital requirements for our businesses from cash flow as well as from existing cash, cash investments, and, if the need should arise,  borrowings under our credit facility. We do not believe there will be a need to issue any securities to fund such capital requirements.  

Dividends  

In the first  three quarters of 2016, we paid a regular cash dividend in the amount of $0.06 per share on our common stock. The regular cash dividend amounted to $2,623 in the first quarter of 2016, $2,623 in the second quarter of 2016, and $2,623 in the third quarter of 2016 for aggregate dividend payments of $7  ,869 in the first nine months of 2016.  

In the  first three quarters of 2015, we paid a regular cash dividend in the amount of $0.06 per share on our common stock. The regular cash dividend was $2,623 in the first quarter of 2015, $2,624 in the second quarter of 2015, and $2,623 in the third quarter of 2015, amounting to aggregate dividend payments of $7,870 in the first nine months of 2015.     

Capital    Management   

As a result of our initial equity offering, our subsequent positive operating results, the exercise of warrants, and the issuance of shares i n our at-the-market offering, we accumulated excess working capital. Some of this excess working capital has been paid out as special and regular cash dividends. Additionally, regular cash dividends will be paid in 2016, as previously reported. Third parties have not placed significant restrictions on our working capital management decisions.  

A significant portion of these funds was held in cash or cash equivalents at multiple financial institutions. In the periods ended  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we also had investments in certain preferred stock, trust preferred securities, exchange traded debt instruments, and other equity instruments. We classify these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and designate them as being  available-for-sale.  Accordingly, they are recorded at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of stockholders  equity. The fair value of these preferred stock, trust preferred securities, exchange traded debt instruments, and other equity instruments totaled $111  ,009   and $74,667 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Lastly, we maintain depositary accounts such as checking accounts, money market accounts, and other s imilar accounts at selected financial institutions.  

19 

Off-    Balance   Sheet   Arrangements   

We engage in two types of hedging transactions. First, we hedge our biofuels sales through the purchase and sale of futures contracts and options on futures contracts of energy commodities. This activity was captured on our balance sheet at  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Second, we hedge our biofuels feedstock through the execution of purchase contracts and supply agreements with certain vendors. These hedging transactions are recognized in earnings and were not recorded on our balance sheet at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015 because they do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument as defined under GAAP. The purchase of biofuels feedstock generally involves two risk components: basis and price. Basis covers any refining or processing required as well as transportation. Price covers the purchases of the actual agricultural commodity. Both basis and price fluctuate over time. A supply agreement with a vendor constitutes a hedge when we have committed to a certain volume of feedstock in a future period and have fixed the basis for that volume.

Item    3. Quantitative and   Qualitative   Disclosures About   Market   Risk.   

All    dollar amounts   expressed   as   numbers   in   these     Market Risk Disclosures     are   in   thousands   (except   per   share   amounts).   

In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on our costs and, as described elsewhere herein, we have passed some price increases along to our customers. However, we are subject to certain market risks as  described below.  

Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Commodity price risk is inherent in the chemicals and biofuels business both with respect to inputs (electricity, coal, raw materials, bio fuels feedstock, etc.) and outputs (manufactured chemicals and biofuels).  

We seek to mitigate our market risks associated with the manufacturing and sale of chemicals by entering into term sale contracts that include contractual market price adjustment p rotections to allow changes in market prices of key raw materials to be passed on to the customer. Such price protections are not always obtained, however, and some raw material price risk remains significant.  

In order to manage price risk caused by mark et fluctuations in biofuels prices, we may enter into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts. We account for these derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815-20-25,  Derivatives   and   Hedging.    Under this standard, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends upon whether it has been designated as an accounting hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. To qualify for designation as an accounting hedging relationship, specific criteria must be met and appropriate documentation maintained. We had no derivative instruments that qualified under these rules as designated accounting hedges in the first nine   months of 2016 or 2015. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized at the end of each accounting period and recorded in the statement of operations as a component of cost of goods sold within the biodiesel segment.  

Our immediate recognition of derivative instrument ga ins and losses can cause net income to be volatile from period to period due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the volume of biofuel being sold. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair values of our derivative instruments were a net liability in the amount of $3  ,323   and a net asset of $3,362, respectively.  

Our gross profit will be impacted by the prices we pay for raw materials and conversion costs (costs incurred in the production of chemicals  and biofuels) for which we do not possess contractual market price adjustment protection. These items are principally comprised of crude corn oil and yellow grease and petrodiesel. The availability and price of these items are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions, governmental policies, commodity markets, and global supply and demand.  

We prepared a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to market risk with respect to key raw mater ials and conversion costs for which we do not possess contractual market price adjustment protections, based on average prices for the first nine months of 2016. We included only those raw materials and conversion costs for which a hypothetical adverse change in price would result in a 1% or greater decrease in gross profit. Assuming that the prices of the associated finished goods could not be increased and assuming no change in quantities sold, a hypothetical 10% change in the average price of the commodity listed below would result in the following change in gross profit.  

(Volume and dollars in  thousands)    

21 

We had no borrowings as of  September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015 and, as such, we were not exposed to interest rate risk for those periods. Due to the relative insignificance of transactions denominated in foreign currency, we consider our foreign currency risk to be immaterial.  

Item    4. Controls and   Procedures.   

Under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and our principal financial officer and other senior management personnel, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affec t, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART    II   OTHER   INFORMATION   

Item 1.    Legal   Proceedings.   

We are not a party to, nor is any of our property subject to, any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litiga tion incidental to our business. However, from time to time, we may be a party to, or a target of, lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which we expect to be handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While we are unable to predict the outcome of any matters currently pending, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, adverse developments could negatively impact earnings or cash flows in future periods.  

Item    1A.   Risk   Factors.   

There have been no material changes to the risk factors we previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Form 10-K, Annual 

 Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016.

Special    Note   Regarding   Forward   Looking   Information   

This report, and the documents incorporated by reference into this report contain forward-looking statements. Forward- looking statements deal with our current plans,  intentions, beliefs, and expectations, and statements of future economic performance. Statements containing such terms as  believe,   do not believe,   plan,   expect,   intend,   estimate,   anticipate,  and other phrases of similar meaning are considered to contain uncertainty and are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time we or our representatives have made or will make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements may be included in various filings that we make with the SEC, or in press releases, or in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers.  

These forward-looking statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and  uncertainties, as well as assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those set forth under the headings  Risk Factors  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in FutureFuel s Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in our future filings made with the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained in this report which reflect our management s opinions only as of their respective dates. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described in this report and in subsequent filings with the SEC are not the only ones we face. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. There may be additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. If any such risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. You should consult any additional disclosures we have made or will make in our reports to the SEC on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, and any amendments thereto. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this report.

Statement  of Computation of Per Share Earnings   

We compute earnings per share using the two-class method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 260,    Earnings Per Share.  The two-class method is an allocation of earnings between the holders of common stock and a company s participating security holders. Our outstanding non-vested shares of restricted stock contain non- forfeitable rights to dividends and, therefore, are considered participating securities for purposes of computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. We had no other participating securities at September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

Contingently issuable shares associated with outstandi ng service-based restricted stock units were not included in the earnings per share calculations for the three-month and six-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as the vesting conditions had not been satisfied.  

The composition of basic and diluted  earnings per share were as follows:  

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
