  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (In thousands, except per share data) 
  (Unaudited) 

NOTE 1.    Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (the  Company  or  Rudolph ) and in the opinion of management reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for their fair presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual amounts could differ materially from reported amounts.  The interim results for the   three and nine month periods   ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year or any future periods.  This interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ( 2015 10-K ) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 10-K. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain immaterial prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.  
  Debt Issuance Costs:  
  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability on the balance sheet as opposed to being presented as a deferred charge.  Prior to adoption, the Company reported the unamortized debt issuance costs in  Other Assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the change in presentation resulted in a reduction of  Other Assets  of   $261   and a corresponding decrease in  Convertible Senior Notes  with no impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . This ASU provides guidance on statement of cash flows presentation for eight specific cash flow issues where diversity in practice exists. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In  June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326),  which introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. Given the breadth of that scope, the new ASU will impact both financial services and non-financial services entities.  The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   The standard was issued as part of the Simplification Initiative which involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  The standard requires that lessees will be required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of  
  
    5 

     Table of Contents  

more than 12 months.  ASU No. 2016-02 also will require disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information. The standard is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 with earlier adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effects the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The pronouncement requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset, and eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The standard is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effects the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.   This ASU is intended to simplify subsequent measurement of inventory.  An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this ASU at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation.  The standard is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  ASU No. 2014-09 outlines a comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance as amended.  In July 2015, the FASB deferred for one year the effective date of the new revenue standard.  The standard is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 with earlier adoption permitted.  ASU No. 2014-09 allows for two methods of adoption: (a)  full retrospective  adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented, or (b)  modified retrospective  adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying ASU No. 2014-09 is recognized as an adjustment to the 2018 opening retained earnings balance. The Company is in the process of determining the adoption method as well as the effects the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 

NOTE 2.  Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company applies a three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset s or liability s fair value measurement classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  
  The following tables provide the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  
  
    6 

     Table of Contents  

The Company s investments classified as Level 2 are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.  The foreign currency forward contracts are primarily measured based on the foreign currency spot and forward rates quoted by the banks or foreign currency dealers.  Available-for-sale debt securities prices are obtained from third party pricing providers, which models prices utilizing the above observable inputs, for each asset class. 
  Level 3 liabilities consisted of contingent consideration related to an acquisition for which the Company uses a discounted cash flow model to value these liabilities.  The Level 3 assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for the contingent consideration included projected revenues, estimates of discount rates of   9.1%   and timing of cash flows.  A significant decrease in the projected revenues or increase in discount rates could result in a significantly lower fair value measurement for the contingent consideration.   
  This table presents a reconciliation for all liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  :

See Note 3 for additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s marketable securities. 
  Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments  
  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.  The estimated fair value of these obligations is based, primarily, on a market approach, comparing the Company s interest rates to those rates the Company believes it would reasonably receive upon re-entry into the market.  Judgment is required to estimate the fair value, using available market information and appropriate valuation methods.  
  The Company s convertible senior notes matured on July 15, 2016 and the principal payment amount of   $60,000   was paid.  As of September 30, 2016, there were no convertible senior notes outstanding.  The Company s convertible senior notes were not publicly traded. The estimated fair value of the Company s convertible senior notes was valued using a discounted cash flow model.  The Level 3 assumptions, based on data available at the valuation date used in preparing the discounted cash flow model, included estimates of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the convertible senior notes.  The fair value of the contingent interest associated with the convertible senior notes was valued quarterly using the present value under an expected cash flow model incorporating the probabilities of the contingent events occurring.

NOTE 3.   Marketable Securities 
  The Company has evaluated its investment policies and determined that all of its investment securities are to be classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in Stockholders  equity under the caption  Accumulated other comprehensive loss.   Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in  Other (income) expense  in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company records other-than-temporary impairment charges for its available-for-sale investments when it intends to sell the securities, it is more-likely-than not that it will be required to sell the securities before a recovery, or when it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the securities.  The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 
  The Company has determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are temporary in nature. The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , marketable securities are categorized as follows:

     Table of Contents  

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities classified by the maturity date listed on the security, regardless of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet classification, is as follows at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value and gross unrealized holding losses of marketable securities, aggregated by investment instrument and period of time in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :   

See Note 2 for additional discussion regarding the fair value of the Company s marketable securities. 

NOTE 4.    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  The Company, when it considers it to be appropriate, enters into forward contracts to hedge the economic exposures arising from foreign currency denominated transactions. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these contracts included the future sale of Japanese Yen to purchase U.S. dollars.  Derivative instruments are recognized as either  prepaid expenses and other current assets  or  other current liabilities  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are measured at fair value.  The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into by the Company s Japanese subsidiary to economically hedge a portion of certain intercompany obligations. The forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and decreases in the fair value of   $384   and   $272   for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, are recorded within the caption  Other (income) expense  in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  The dollar equivalent of the U.S. dollar forward contracts and related fair values as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

NOTE 5.    Purchased Intangible Assets 
  Purchased intangible assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows:

     Table of Contents  

Intangible asset amortization expense for the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016   was   $595   and   $1,785  , respectively.  For the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015  , intangible assets amortization expenses was   $515   and   $1,545  , respectively.  Assuming no change in the gross carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and estimated lives, estimated amortization expense for the remainder of   2016   will be   $535  , and for each of the next five years estimated amortization expense amounts to   $1,933   for   2017  ,   $1,496   for   2018  ,   $1,496   for   2019  ,   $1,294   for   2020  , and   $546   for   2021  .

NOTE 7.   Debt Obligations 
  On   July 25, 2011  , the Company issued   $60,000   aggregate principal amount of   3.75%   Convertible Senior Notes due   2016   (the  Notes ) at par. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of   July 25, 2011  , between the Company and Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, which includes a form of Note. The Notes provided for the payment of interest semi-annually in arrears on   January 15   and   July 15   of each year, beginning   January 15, 2012  , at an annual rate of   3.75%  .     Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased a convertible note hedge and sold a warrant.  Each of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were entered into with an affiliate of the initial purchaser of the Notes. The convertible note hedge was intended to reduce the potential future dilution to the Company s common stock associated with the conversion of the Notes.  However, the warrant transaction may have a dilutive effect on the Company s earnings per share to the extent that the price of the Company s common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrant.  The strike price of the warrant is   $17.00   per share subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  The warrant has a series of expiration dates beginning October 2016 and ending in January 2017. 
   On July 15, 2016, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding   3.75%   Convertible Senior Notes with an aggregate principle amount of   $60,000  .  Under the terms of the indenture, holders of the Notes were paid cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and were issued shares of common stock for the remainder of the conversion, with any fractional shares paid in cash.  The conversion resulted in the issuance of   540   shares of common stock of the Company to the bondholders, but resulted in no dilution to Rudolph shareholders as these shares were covered by the convertible note hedge that was entered into by the Company in 2011 at the time of issuance of the notes.

NOTE 8.   Commitments and Contingencies 
  Warranty Reserves 
  The Company generally provides a warranty on its products for a period of 12 to 15 months against defects in material and workmanship. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred during the warranty period and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized. The Company s estimate is based primarily on historical experience. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. Settlements of warranty reserves are generally associated with sales that occurred during the 12 to 15 months prior to the quarter-end and warranty accruals are related to sales during the same year. 
    
  Changes in the Company s warranty reserves are as follows: 

Warranty reserves are reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within the caption  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  
  Legal Matters 
  From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company s 2015 10-K reflects the status of the Company s litigation with Integrated Technology Corporation ( ITC ) and Camtek, Ltd. ( Camtek ).  The following reflects the material developments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 with regard to these matters. 
    
  Integrated Technology Corporation v. Rudolph Technologies, Inc., No. CV-06-2182 (PHX-ROS)  :  This matter is fully resolved with the sole exception of the issue of remanded attorney s fees which were set by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona (the  AZ District Court ) at   $3,252  .  Subsequent to the Company s successful appeal before the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals (the  Court of Appeals ), the matter was remanded back to the AZ District Court for a determination of a proper fee award.

attorney s fees.  The payment shall be secured from the escrow the Company established of   $3,252   which is recorded as  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   September 30, 2016  .  The liability of   $1,289   was reduced from $3,252 with the benefit recorded in  Research and development  expense and the liability recorded under the caption  Other current liabilities  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at   September 30, 2016  .  The balance of the funds in escrow shall be returned to the Company.  Upon payment of the court ordered amount, this matter will be closed. 
    
  August Technology Corporation and Rudolph Technologies, Inc. v. Camtek, Ltd., No. 05-CV-01396 (JRT/FLN)  :  Subsequent to the ruling by the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota (the  MN District Court ) in the Company s favor that Camtek s Falcon tools continue to infringe the Company s patent under the revised claim construction of the patent determined by the Court of Appeals, the MN District Court, on February 9, 2015, issued an Order granting the Company s Motion for Final Judgment, reinstating the original damages and applying prejudgment interest for a total award of   $14,512  . In addition, the MN District Court issued a permanent injunction against Camtek from  making, using, selling and offering to sell any of its Falcon machines and any machines that are colorable imitations thereof in the United States, intended for sale and use within the United States, until the expiration of the  6,298 patent,  which is projected to be in 2020. While, in March of 2015, Camtek filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals challenging the MN District Court s ruling, the Court of Appeals denied Camtek s appeal on February 3, 2016, affirming both the infringement ruling and the damages and interest totaling approximately   $14,632   assessed against Camtek by the MN District Court, the payment of which is guaranteed by a supersedeas bond.  All of Camtek s rights to appeal the final judgment have expired.  On July 22, 2016, the MN District Court ordered that the full amount of the judgment be paid to the Company.  With the payment of the final judgment amount on August 11, 2016, this matter has been closed. 
    
  August Technology Corporation and Rudolph Technologies, Inc. v. Camtek, Ltd., No. 10-CV-2202 (MJD/FLN)  :  With regard to the Company s subsequently filed lawsuit against Camtek  in the MN District Court alleging infringement of its U.S. Patent No. 7,729,528, this lawsuit continues to be stayed pending resolution of a re-examination petition filed by Camtek with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.   
    
  Rudolph Technologies, Inc. v. Camtek, Ltd., No. 15-CV-1246 (ADM/BRT)  :  On March 12, 2015, the Company filed and served on Camtek a complaint asserting infringement of Rudolph  6,298 patent by Camtek s Eagle product with the MN District Court.  On April 21, 2015, the Company filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction to enjoin Camtek s sale of the Eagle device in the United States which is currently pending.  On or about April 20, 2015, Camtek filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the  NJ District Court ) seeking a declaratory judgment challenging the jurisdiction and venue of the Minnesota court and seeking to have the NJ District Court find that the  6,298 patent is not infringed and, in the alternative, that the  6,298 patent is invalid.  On August 26, 2015, the MN District Court ruled that Minnesota jurisdiction was appropriate for this matter while at the same time denying the Company s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  Camtek s complaint filed in the NJ District Court was subsequently dismissed.  In August of 2016, the MN District Court issued rulings on Summary Judgment Motions which found that Camtek is precluded from a) re-litigating the validity of the  6,298 patent and b) opening up for claim construction any terms that were defined in the prior litigation.  Claims not defined in the prior litigation may be defined in this case.  A trial ready date of April 2017 has been set for this litigation. 
    
  Line of Credit 
       
  The Company has a credit agreement with a bank that provides for a line of credit which is secured by the marketable securities the Company has with the bank.  The Company is permitted to borrow up to 70% of the value of eligible securities held at the time the line of credit is accessed.  The available line of credit as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $60,000  .  The Company terminated a prior credit agreement and entered into a new credit agreement in June 2016. The credit agreement is available to the Company until such time that either party terminates the arrangement at their discretion.  The Company has not utilized the line of credit to date.

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was   $9,898   and   $8,221   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units granted under the Company s stock plans, respectively.  That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   3.0   years and   2.6   years for the respective periods. 

NOTE 10.   Other (Income) Expense 

NOTE 11.   Income Taxes 
  The following table provides details of income taxes:  

The income tax provision for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was computed based on the Company s annual forecast of profit by jurisdiction and forecasted effective tax rate for the year.  The changes in the Company s effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period for the prior year are primarily due to changes in the mix of forecasted earnings by jurisdictions, an additional IRC Section 199 Manufacturing deduction expected to be generated for the year ended December 31, 2016, the availability of the research and development credit for the full year 2016 as compared to the enactment of the credit in the fourth quarter 2015, offset by utilization of NOL and related valuation allowance on our foreign subsidiary in the third quarter of 2015. 
  The Company currently has a partial valuation allowance recorded against certain foreign and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards where the realizability of such deferred tax assets is substantially in doubt.  Each quarter, the Company assesses the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets. The Company considers available evidence, both positive and negative, including forecasted earnings in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.  As a result of the Company s analysis, it concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, the Company continues to provide a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.  The Company continues to monitor available evidence and may reverse some or all of the remaining valuation allowance in future periods, if appropriate.  The Company has a recorded valuation allowance against certain of its deferred tax assets of   $2,205   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 

NOTE 12.   Earnings Per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same manner and also gives effect to all dilutive common equivalent  
  
    14 

     Table of Contents  

shares outstanding during the period.  Potential common shares that would have the effect of increasing diluted earnings per share are considered to be anti-dilutive.  In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these shares were not included in calculating diluted earnings per share.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the weighted average number of stock options and restricted stock units excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share were   52   and   0  , respectively.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the weighted average number of stock options and restricted stock units totaling   238   and   0  , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , diluted earnings per share-weighted average shares outstanding included the effect resulting from assumed conversion of the Notes and warrants.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   diluted earnings per share-weighted average shares outstanding do not include any effect resulting from assumed conversion of the Notes and warrants as their impact was anti-dilutive. 
  The Company s basic and diluted earnings per share amounts are as follows:  

NOTE 13.   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  Comprehensive income includes net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, and net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments.  See the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the effect of the components of comprehensive income on the Company s net income. 
  The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, are as follows:

  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as defined below. 
  A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) we are required to make judgments and assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. 
  Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. In

     Table of Contents  

addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. Certain of these uncertainties are discussed in our   2015   10-K in the sections entitled  Risk Factors  and  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, we believe that our condensed consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and provide a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. 
  For more information, please see our critical accounting policies as previously disclosed in our   2015   10-K. 
  See Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our financial position and results of operations. 
  Results of Operations for the   Three and Nine Month Periods Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  We are a worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of process control defect inspection and metrology, advanced packaging lithography, and data analysis systems and software used by microelectronic device manufacturers.  We provide process and yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for macro-defect inspection, lithography, probe card test and analysis, and transparent and opaque thin film measurements. All Rudolph systems feature sophisticated software and production-worthy automation.  Rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer support. 
  Our business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment. The amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors, including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer, tablet, cell phone, other personal electronic devices and automotive sales.  Current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry project year-over-year capital spending to be flat for 2016.  Our revenues and profitability tend to follow the trends of certain segments within the semiconductor market.  We monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly-published industry data such as the book-to-bill ratio. The book-to-bill ratio is a 3-month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments. A book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers  shipments for the period. The 3-month rolling average North American semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio was   1.1   for the month of   September 2016  , an increase from book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 for the month of June 2016.  The book-to-bill ratio was 1.0 for the month of December 2015. 
  Historically, a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers, and we expect this trend to continue. For the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016   and for the years ended December 31,   2015  ,   2014   and   2013  , sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for   42.3%  ,   23.3%  ,   23.9%  , and   41.6%   of our revenues, respectively. 
  We do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products, and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time.  A delay in purchase or a cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly.  In addition, during a given quarter, a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems, with one customer accounting for 10.0% of our total revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  The following table lists the average selling price for our systems: 

A significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the United States.  A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.  We expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the United States will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues.  
  The sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from   six to twenty-four months  , and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology. Due to the length of these cycles, we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments. 
  Revenues.   Our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of our systems, services, spare parts and software licensing.  Our revenues of   $61.6 million   increased   5.2%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year when revenues totaled   $58.6 million  . For the nine month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our revenues totaled   $178.7 million   and   $170.6 million  , respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of   4.7%  . 
  
    18 

     Table of Contents  

The following table lists, for the periods indicated, the different sources of our revenues in dollars (thousands) and as percentages of our total revenues: 

Total systems and software revenue increased   $5.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Process control system revenue decreased   $5.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower metrology system sales in the 2016 period.  Lithography system revenue increased   $8.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to shipment of a JetStep G system in the second quarter of 2016.  Software revenue increased   $2.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to increased software licensing sales.  Systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to   74%    of total revenues for both the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   69%   of total revenues for both the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015  .  The year-over-year increase in total parts and services revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , is primarily due to increased spending by our customers on system upgrades and repairs of existing systems. Parts and services revenues are generated from part sales, maintenance service contracts, system upgrades, as well as time and material billable service calls.  
  Deferred revenues of   $10.5 million   are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within the captions  Deferred revenue  and  Other non-current liabilities  at   September 30, 2016   and primarily consist of   $3.1 million   for outstanding deliverables and   $7.4 million   for deferred maintenance agreements. 
  Gross Profit.   Our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including manufacturing efficiencies, excess and obsolete inventory charges and provisions, pricing by competitors or suppliers, new product introductions, production volume, customization and reconfiguration of systems, international and domestic sales mix, and parts and service margins. Our gross profit was   $32.4 million   and   $95.7 million   for the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $31.9 million   and   $92.8 million   for the same periods in the prior year.  Our gross profit represented   52.6%   and   53.5%   of our revenues for the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, gross profit represented   54.5%   and   54.4%   of our revenues.  The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to change in product sales mix. 
  Operating Expenses.   Major components of operating expenses include research and development as well as selling, general and administrative expenses.        
  Research and Development  .  Our research and development expense was   $9.3 million   and   $33.7 million   for the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $10.0 million   and   $30.9 million   for the same periods in the prior year.  Research and development expense represented   15.1%   and   18.8%   of our revenues for the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   17.1%   and   18.1%   of revenues for the prior year periods.  Research and development expenses increased for the nine month period year-over-year due to increased compensation and project costs, partially offset by a reduction of accrued legal fees from a prior judgment.  
  Selling, General and Administrative  .     Our selling, general and administrative expense was   $9.9 million   and   $28.9 million   for the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $9.4 million   and   $33.4 million   for the same period in the prior year.  Selling, general and administrative expense represented   16.1%   and   16.2%   of our revenues for the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   16.0%   and   19.6%   of our revenues for the same period in the prior year.  The year-over-year dollar decrease for the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016   in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation and legal costs.

     Table of Contents  

Other (Income) Expense.    Our other (income) expense consists of gains on disposals of property, plant and equipment and net foreign currency exchange (gains) losses. For the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded other income of   $94 thousand  , compared to other expense of   $99 thousand  , for the same period in the prior year.  The year-over-year dollar increase in other income for the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to sale of the Flanders, New Jersey, corporate office, partially offset by weakening of local currencies at our foreign operations compared to the U.S. dollar. 
  Income Taxes  .  We recorded an income tax provision of   $3.7 million   and   $12.3 million  , respectively, for the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016  .  Our effective tax rate of   28.5%   differs from the statutory rate of   35%   for the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016   primarily due to a projected IRC Section 199 manufacturing deduction, additional foreign tax credits generated and the availability of the research and development credit in 2016.  For the   three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded an income tax provision of   $3.7 million   and   $7.6 million  , respectively. 
   We currently have a partial valuation allowance recorded for certain foreign and state loss and credit carryforwards where the realizability of such deferred tax assets is substantially in doubt.  Each quarter we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets primarily relating to state research and development credits. We consider available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.  As a result of our analysis, we concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, we continue to provide a valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets.  We continue to monitor available evidence and may reverse some or all of the valuation allowance in future periods, if appropriate. 
  Litigation.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded income and received cash from a patent litigation judgment of $14.6 million in conjunction with the final court ruling in the patent infringement litigation case against Camtek, Ltd. ( Camtek ) with the expiration of all opportunities to appeal.  As discussed in Part I, Item 3.  Legal Proceedings  of our 2015 10-K and Note 8 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are subject to separate legal proceedings and claims, which include, among other things, our litigation with Camtek.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $123.3 million   of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and   $226.3 million   in working capital.  At   December 31, 2015  , we had   $161.5 million   of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and   $197.3 million   in working capital. 
  Operating activities provided   $30.8 million   in net cash and cash equivalents for the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016  .  The net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities during the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016   was primarily a result of net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash operating charges, of   $43.9 million  , partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $13.1 million  .  Operating activities provided   $22.6 million   in net cash and cash equivalents for the   nine month period ended September 30, 2015  . The net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities during the   nine month period ended September 30, 2015   was primarily a result of a net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash operating charges, of   $31.0 million  , partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of   $8.4 million  . 
  Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016   of   $30.3 million   was due to proceeds from sales of marketable securities of   $141.9 million   and   $1.2 million   due to proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by the purchase of marketable securities of   $110.3 million   and capital expenditures of   $2.5 million  .  Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the   nine month period ended September 30, 2015   of   $13.5 million   was due to the purchase of marketable securities of   $183.7 million  , purchase of intangible assets of   $3.0 million   and capital expenditures of   $2.2 million  , partially offset by the proceeds from sales of marketable securities of   $175.5 million  . 
  Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities during the   nine month period ended September 30, 2016   of   $68.6 million   was due primarily to the payment for redemption of the senior convertible debt of   $60.0 million  , repurchase of shares of our common stock of   $8.0 million   and tax payments related to shares withheld for share-based compensation plans of   $1.6 million  , partially offset by tax benefit and proceeds from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans of   $1.1 million  .  For the   nine month period ended September 30, 2015  , financing activities used   $19.0 million  , resulting primarily from the repurchases of shares of our common stock of   $17.1 million   and tax payments related to shares withheld for share-based compensation plans of   $1.9 million  , partially offset by tax benefit and proceeds from sales of shares through share-based compensation plans of   $0.2 million  .  For further information about the redemption of the senior convertible debt, see Note 7 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In   January 2015  , our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to   3.0 million shares   of our common stock with no established end date.  The authorization allows for repurchases to be made in the open market or through negotiated transactions from time to time.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased   0.6 million   shares of common

stock.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   0.7 million   shares remained available for future stock repurchase under this repurchase authorization.  Shares of common stock purchased under the share repurchase authorization are being retired.  For further information, see Note 15 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  We have a credit agreement with a bank that provides for a line of credit which is secured by the marketable securities we have with the bank.  We are permitted to borrow up to a percentage of the value of the marketable securities held at the time the line of credit is accessed.  We terminated a prior credit agreement and entered into a new credit agreement in June 2016. The credit agreement is available to us until such time that either party terminates the arrangement at their discretion.   We have not utilized the line of credit to date. 
    
  From time to time, we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses, products and/or technologies. We may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.  
  Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions, which will affect our ability to generate additional cash. We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs for the next twelve months. Thereafter, if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings, sales of securities or other means. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital or secure any such additional funding on terms acceptable to us or at all. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Interest Rate and Credit Market Risk 
  We are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity including our investments in certain available-for-sale securities. Our available-for-sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate income investments (municipal notes, municipal bonds and corporate bonds). We continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates, market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers for our available-for-sale securities. It is possible that we are at risk if interest rates, market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction. The magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed or variable rate of the financial instrument and the market rate, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of   September 30, 2016  , an immediate adverse change of   10% in interest rates (e.g. 3.00% to 3.30%)   would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities and would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  We have branch operations in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea and wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, China and Japan.  Our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies.  The intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars appearing on the financial statements of the subsidiaries and branches are remeasured at each quarter-end resulting in gains and losses which are reflected in net income.  A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar relative to the reporting currencies of our foreign operations at   September 30, 2016   would have affected the foreign-currency-denominated non-operating expenses of our foreign operations by approximately   $4.5 million  . We cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  A substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars with the exception of Japan and, as a result, we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales. Substantially all our sales in Japan are denominated in Japanese yen. From time to time, we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months. The change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in  Other (income) expense  in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for each reporting period. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   sixteen   forward contracts outstanding with a total notional contract value of   $5.2 million  . We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief  
  
    21 

     Table of Contents  

Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  
  Scope of the Controls Evaluation 
  The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls  objectives and design, our implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In the course of the evaluation, we sought to identify data errors, control problems or acts of fraud and confirm that appropriate corrective actions, if any, including process improvements, were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management, including the CEO and CFO, concerning the effectiveness of the controls can be reported in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K. Many of the components of our disclosure controls and procedures are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by other personnel in our accounting, finance and legal functions. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to modify them on an ongoing basis as necessary. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
  Conclusions 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  In   January 2015  , our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to   3.0 million shares   of our common stock with no established end date.  The authorization allows for repurchases to be made in the open market or through negotiated transactions from time to time.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased approximately   0.6 million   shares of common stock.  At   September 30, 2016  ,   0.7 million   shares remained available for future stock repurchase under this repurchase authorization.  Shares of common stock purchased under the share repurchase authorization are being retired.  For further information, see Note 15 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In addition to our share repurchase program, we withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our equity incentive program. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, net share settlements were immaterial.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we withheld   122 thousand   shares through net share settlements, at a cost of   $1.6 million  . Please refer to Note 9 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further additional information regarding our share-based compensation plans.
