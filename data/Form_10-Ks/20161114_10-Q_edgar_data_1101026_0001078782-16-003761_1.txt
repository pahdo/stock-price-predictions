ZIVO BIOSCIENCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
    NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of  Zivo Bioscience , Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ).  All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  In the opinion of the Company s management, the financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the information set forth therein.  These consolidated financial statements are condensed, and therefore do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s December 31, 2015 consolidated audited financial statements and supplementary data included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016. 
   
 The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, or any other period. 
   
 The Company had a loss from operations of $2,847,785 and $2,392,532 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  In addition, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $6,086,630 and a stockholders  deficit of $12,769,130 at September 30, 2016.  These factors continue to raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  During the first nine months of 2016, the Company raised $2,350,000 from the issuance of Convertible Debt and $2,315 from net loans payable to related parties.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital. 
   
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   Principles of Consolidation    
   
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zivo Bioscience, Inc. and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, Health Enhancement Corporation, HEPI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., WellMetris, LLC, and Zivo Biologic, Inc. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
   Accounting Estimates    
   
 The Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may, as warranted, solicit external professional advice and other assumptions believed to be reasonable. 
   
   Cash and Cash Equivalents    
   
 For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.

  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)  
   
   Property and Equipment   
   
 Property and equipment consists of furniture, office equipment, and leasehold improvements, and are carried at cost less allowances for depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is determined by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.  Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend the economic life of an existing fixed asset are expended as incurred.    
   
   Fair Value Measurements   
   
  The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or the most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact, and (iv) willing to transact. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:   
   
  Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
   
  Level 2   Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable market data or substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  
   
  Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the value of the assets or liabilities.  
   
 The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accounts payable   related parties, accrued expenses and loans payable - related parties.  All of these items were determined to be Level 1 fair value measurements. 
   
 The carrying amounts of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, loans payable - related parties and the current portion of convertible debt all approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.  The recorded value of long-term convertible debt approximates fair value as the terms and rates approximate market rates. 
   
   Deferred Financing Costs   
   
 The Company follows authoritative guidance for accounting for financing costs as it relates to convertible debt issuance cost. These costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the debt period or until redemption of the convertible debentures. Amortization of deferred financing costs amounted to $-0- and $-0- for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)  
   
   Revenue Recognition    
   
 For revenue from product sales, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue Recognition  ( SAB No. 104 ), which superseded Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements  ( SAB No. 101 ). SAB No. 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no revenue. 
   
   Shipping and Handling Costs   
   
 Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no shipping and handling costs were incurred. 
   
   Research and Development   
   
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Research Expenses and Clinical Studies Expenses consist of fees, charges, and related expenses incurred in the conduct of clinical studies conducted with Company products by independent external entities. External clinical studies expenses were approximately $601,000 and $776,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
   Stock Based Compensation    
   
 We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation.   Under the provisions of FASB ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.  The company generally issues grants to its employees, consultants and board members.  At the date of grant, the company determines the fair value of the stock option award and recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period.  The fair value of the stock option or warrant award is calculated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. 
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as a result of the vesting of warrants to directors and the issuances of warrants to certain employees, directors and consultants, the Company recorded stock based compensation expense of $1,175,632 and $460,924 for these periods, respectively. 
   
 The fair value of warrants was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions:

  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   (continued)  
   
   Stock Based Compensation    (continued)  
   
 The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company s employee warrants have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion the existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee options. 
   
   Loss Per Share   
   
 Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the Company s net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period presented. Diluted loss per share is based on the treasury stock method and includes the effect from potential issuance of common stock such as shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of warrants and conversions of debentures.  Potentially dilutive securities as of September 30, 2016, consisted of 102,036,360 common shares from convertible debentures and related accrued interest and 30,167,488 common shares from outstanding warrants. Potentially dilutive securities as of September 30, 2015, consisted of 66,652,108 common shares from convertible debentures and related accrued interest and 14,456,371 common shares from outstanding warrants.   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, diluted and basic weighted average shares were the same, as potentially dilutive shares are anti-dilutive. 
   
   Advertising Costs   
   
 Advertising costs are charged to operations when incurred. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no advertising costs.   
   
   Concentrations of Credit Risk    
   
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents.  The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions which exceed the current Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) limit of $250,000 at times during the year.   
   
   Reclassifications   
 Certain items in these consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
   
   Future Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards   
   
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09),  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflect the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. ASU 2014-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
   
 Management does not believe there would have been a material effect on the accompanying financial statements had any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards been adopted in the current period.

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
   
  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
   
 Some of the statements contained in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our or our industry s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to statements regarding:  

our ability to raise the funds we need to continue our operations; 
   
 our goal to increase our revenues and become profitable; 
   
 regulation of our product; 
   
 market acceptance of our product and derivatives thereof; 
   
 the results of current and future testing of our product; 
   
 the anticipated performance and benefits of our product; 
   
 the ability to generate licensing fees; and 
   
 our financial condition or results of operations. 
   
 In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as  may, will, should, could, would, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, projects, predicts, potential  and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except as otherwise required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained in this report to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any of our forward-looking statements are based. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies   
   
 The accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and all available information. However, future events are subject to change, and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment. US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including those related to recording various accruals, income taxes, the useful lives of long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets, and potential losses from contingencies and litigation. We believe the policies discussed above are the most critical to our financial statements because they are affected significantly by management's judgments, assumptions and estimates.  
   
  Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
   
   Overview:   
   
 For ZIVO, we have put in place a business model in which we would derive future income from licensing and selling natural bioactive ingredients that may be derived from or are initially based on the algae cultures. We expect that these planned new products will likely be sold to much larger, better-financed animal, food, dietary supplement and medical food manufacturers.  The anticipated income streams are to be generated from a) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients, and b) bulk sales of such ingredients. These bulk ingredients will likely be made by contracted ingredient manufacturers and then sold by us to animal food, dietary supplement and medical food processors and/or name-brand marketers. Further, we expect to license our bioactive molecules as lead compounds or templates for synthetic variants intended for therapeutic applications.

For WellMetris, we are developing, with the intention to manufacture, market, and sell tests, that we believe will allow people to optimize their health and identify future health risks.  We plan to develop and commercialize such tests in three phases: 

In phase one ( Phase One ) or, alternately named Gen 1.0, we plan to develop and commercialize a series of tests, which are intended to measure indicators of good health and optimal metabolic function (collectively, the  Phase One Test ). The Phase One Test is being designed to measure biomarkers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and antioxidant status to establish a metabolic assessment from which intervention can commence, and from which metabolic syndrome can be inferred. 

In phase two ( Phase Two ) or alternately named Gen 1.5, we plan to develop and commercialize a testing technology focused on the positive or negative metabolic effects of metabolizing fat and muscle efficiency due to changes in diet, exertion, hydration and dietary supplements in a self-administered format that integrates with smartphone operating systems. 

In phase three ( Phase Three ) or alternately named Gen 2.0, we plan to develop and commercialize additional tests intended to provide a more complete metabolic profile for an individual utilizing the metabolites present in urine. The Company believes the Gen 2.0 tests, in aggregate, will allow identification of healthy versus unhealthy bodily processes in real-time. This technology can also be applied to livestock and companion animals. As capital funding becomes available, the Company will move forward with finalizing its transition cow syndrome test, for which a provisional patent application has already been filed. 
   
 We believe there is a viable market for our Wellness Tests. According to the Center for Disease Control, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer are the leading causes of death in the United States. The Wellness Tests are intended to identify pre-conditions to such illnesses. Such identification may allow for early intervention and reduce incidence of such illnesses or forestall their onset.  This is critically important to large employers, insurers and governmental agencies who are payers for health claims and are facing massive increases in premiums or cash outlays. 
   
 The WellMetris technology also incorporates sophisticated software to analyze, report, record and manage wellness and health data for large groups such as large employers, pension funds, accountable care organizations, state Medicaid agencies and their actuarial consultants, underwriters, re-insurers and wellness consultants. The software also contains tools to conduct meta-analysis of baseline health benchmarks and monitor the progress of pre-clinical intervention programs within large groups.

   General and Administrative Expenses  . 
   
 General and administrative expenses were $195,481 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $225,047 for the comparable prior period.  The decrease of approximately $30,000 in general and administrative expense during 2016 is primarily due to lower funding for WellMetris expenses. 
   
   Professional and Consulting Expenses  . 
   
 Professional and consulting expenses were $355,941 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $343,320 for the comparable prior period.  The increase of approximately $13,000 in professional and consulting expense during 2016 is mainly due to an increase in investor relation consultants of $87,000, engagement of an investment banker for $50,000, offset by a reduction of professional fees of $66,000 and a reduction in director fees of $58,000 (due to the calculated value of the warrants issued).

Research and Development Expenses  .   
   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $ 125,695  in research and development expenses as compared to $ 219,938  for the comparable period in 2015.   
   
 Of these expenses, $103,483 and $115,984 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are costs associated with external research relating to Zivo. Our research and development costs will grow as we work to complete the research in the development of natural bioactive compounds for use as dietary supplements and food ingredients, as well as biologics for medicinal and pharmaceutical applications in humans and animals. The Company s scientific efforts are focused on the metabolic aspects of oxidation and inflammation, with a parallel program to validate and license products for healthy immune response.  The reduction of $12,500 from the prior period is due to the lack of available funding.  
   
 With respect to our WellMetris, LLC subsidiary, we incurred $22,212 and $103,953 in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The R D effort to date has centered on optimizing dry chemistry, developing lower-cost alternatives for the proprietary analyzer device, negotiating and collaborating with offshore manufacturers and assembling the FDA pre-submission package for product classification and approval.  The reduction of $82,000 from the prior period is due to the lack of available funding.

 General and administrative expenses were $600,150 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $608,893 for the comparable prior period. The decrease of approximately $9,000 in general and administrative expense during 2016 is primarily due to a reduction in travel expenses. 
   
   Professional and Consulting Expenses  . 
   
 Professional and consulting expenses were $1,646,669 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,008,128 for the comparable prior period.  The increase of approximately $639,000 in professional and consulting expense during 2016 is mainly due to     the issuance of warrants to purchase 14,500,000 shares of common stock pursuant to agreements with financial consultants which were valued at $1,095,063 and is a non-cash expense.  The prior period also included the issuance of warrants to purchase 3,125,000 shares of common stock pursuant to an agreement with a financial consultant, with the warrants valued at $285,305 (a non-cash expense), resulting in a net increase of $810,000.  In 2016, a $175,000 expense for stock issued to an Investor Relations firm (a non-cash expense) offset by a 2015 expense for stock issued to an Investor Relations firm (a non-cash expense) of $115,000, resulting in a net increase of $60,000.  In 2016, the Board of Directors was issued warrants valued at $69,000 compared to the valued of warrants issued in 2015 of $117,000, a decrease of $48,000 (warrants issued are a non-cash expense). After considering the net effects of the non-cash expenses, cash related expenses were $183,000 less than the prior period due to a reduction in professional and consulting fees. 
   
   Research and Development Expenses  .   
   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $600,966 in research and development expenses, as compared to $775,511 for the comparable period in 2015.  
   
 Of these expenses, $328,352 and $495,586 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are costs associated with external research relating to Zivo. Our research and development costs will grow as we work to complete the research in the development of natural bioactive compounds for use as dietary supplements and food ingredients, as well as biologics for medicinal and pharmaceutical applications in humans and animals. The Company s scientific efforts are focused on the metabolic aspects of oxidation and inflammation, with a parallel program to validate and license products for healthy immune response.  The reduction of $167,000 from the prior period is due to the lack of available funding. 

22 

With respect to our WellMetris, LLC subsidiary, we incurred $272,614 and $279,924 in research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The R D effort to date has centered on optimizing dry chemistry, developing lower-cost alternatives for the proprietary analyzer device, negotiating and collaborating with offshore manufacturers and assembling the FDA pre-submission package for product classification and approval.  The research and development expenses are relatively consistent between periods. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report have been prepared on a  going concern  basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have a near term need for additional capital.  For the reasons discussed herein, there is a significant risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern, in which case, you would suffer a total loss of your investment in our company. 
   
 As of November 9, 2016, we had a cash balance of approximately $970,000.  We have incurred significant net losses since inception. We have, since inception, consistently incurred negative cash flow from operations. During the period ended September 30, 2016, we incurred negative cash flows from operations of $1,723,623.  As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficiency of $6,086,630 and a stockholders  deficiency of $12,769,130. Although we recently raised a limited amount of capital, we have had difficulty raising capital and we have a near term need for significant additional capital. 
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our operating activities used $1,723,623 in cash, a increase of $86,700 from the comparable prior period.   The approximate $77,000 increase in cash used by operating activities was primarily attributable to the following (all of which are approximated): a $56,000 decrease in net income, offset by $176,000 in non-cash expenses, $248,000 of changes (decrease) in accounts payable - $232,000, and an increase in prepaid expenses - $17,000, offset by $216,000 of changes of increases to Due to Related Party and accrued liabilities.   
   
 Our financing activities generated approximately $2,292,000, an approximate $463,000 increase from the comparable prior period. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was due to an approximately $783,000 increase of proceeds from issuance of convertible debentures, offset by a decrease in proceeds of $211,000 from loans from related parties, a decrease in proceeds of $49,000 from the sale of common stock and the exercise of common stock warrants and $60,000 of deferred finance costs incurred.  
   
 Although we raised a limited amount of capital during 2015 and the nine months of 2016, we continue to experience a shortage of capital, which is materially and adversely affecting our ability to run our business. As noted above, we have been largely dependent upon external sources for funding. We have in the past had great difficulty in raising capital from external sources. We will still be reliant upon external financing for the continuation of our research program.   
   
 During the course of 2016, we have hired financial advisors to determine the viability of selling a portion of our WellMetris LLC subsidiary and to identify candidates to effect such a transaction.  Any such capital proceeds from this event would be used for working capital. 
   
 We estimate that we will require approximately $5,000,000 in cash over the next 12 months in order to fund our normal operations and research and development activities.  Based on this cash requirement, we have a near term need for substantial additional funding.  While we have been able to raise capital in limited amounts, historically, we have had great difficulty raising funds from external sources; however, we recently were able to raise capital from outside sources. If we are unable to raise the required funding, we will have to continue to curtail our research and development and other activities, in which case, there could be a material adverse effect on our business. 
   
  Significant elements of income or loss not arising from our continuing operations  
   
 We do not expect to experience any significant elements of income or loss other than those arising from our continuing operation.  

23 

Seasonality  
   
 Based on our business model implemented at the beginning of 2012, anticipated income streams are to be generated from the following:  
   
 For ZIVO:  
   
 a) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients, isolated natural compounds and synthetic variants thereof, and b) bulk sales of such ingredients.  
   
 For WellMetris: 
   
 The selling of wellness tests and data services related to medical records management and analysis/compilation of data gathered on behalf of payers. For insurers, the primary selling season is November through April of any given year. 
   
  Staffing  
   
 We have conducted all of our activities since inception with a minimum level of qualified staff. We currently do not expect a significant increase in staff.   
   
  Off-Balance Sheet arrangements  
   
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that would create contingent or other forms of liability. 
   
  Item 4   
  Controls and Procedures  
   
  Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  
   
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible changes or additions to our controls and procedures. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive/principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive/principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are effective in enabling us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings within the required time period. 
   
  Changes in Internal control Over Financial Reporting.  
   
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
